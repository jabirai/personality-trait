9970.0,Patient,hi.
706.0,Provider,How are you.
9970.0,Patient,how's for those good to another problem.
706.0,Provider,"No, I apologize for that I kept trying to let you in yesterday and it wouldn't let me and then all of a sudden my wi fi just completely shut down. And it was off for like 20 minutes, probably, so I don't know if there was just a weird surge with our cable company or what but I didn't have any any wi fi to have Internet access, so I apologize for that."
9970.0,Patient,And I apologize for missing in our first appointment.
706.0,Provider,"Oh, I mean it happens life happens by appreciate that Thank you."
9970.0,Patient,"yeah I overslept. I was i've been. My sleeping happen hasn't been good and lately. Okay yesterday was. Yesterday, as I was trying to contact you I was being cranky and and. Mad at you, because I was sleepy and I was drowsy and I almost fell asleep a couple of times. yeah my sleeping schedule has been a little bit off. But it's back on track now okay."
706.0,Provider,Why was it what was going on.
9970.0,Patient,"um I don't know, I was off my mentor my man's at one point before our appointment, the day before appointment. I decided, I was sleeping today, which was a bad idea. and That ruins on my sleeping schedule for a vm The night before our appointment okay okay."
706.0,Provider,"So um remember, we talked about last time kind of getting on that consistent schedule, where you're like taking your meds at the same time having lunch at the same time, going to bed at the same time, so that your body knows what to expect remember, we talked about that."
9970.0,Patient,"yeah I think I want to talk to you about that for a second. My eating habits um. i'm like I said before, when i'm on my meds I don't eat at all. mm hmm, but when i'm off my man's I eat a lot. And i'm really trying to worry about myself, because I am a picky eater and the things that I eat i'm not very good for me. and diabetes funds in my family."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so what things do you wake."
9970.0,Patient,Up possum mostly and that's done very good.
706.0,Provider,"Have you tried pastor that's like lower carb pasta or. Sometimes people will do make um. Oh geez any bank. Where you, you make it out of like a vegetable oh I can't even think of what it is i'm drawing a blank anyways there's."
9970.0,Patient,Like.
706.0,Provider,"I mean, I guess you could call it vegan but um it's nuts. Like slash like you can make it out of squash squash zucchini things like."
9970.0,Patient,"Oh, I heard about those."
706.0,Provider,"yeah so you can do that so then it's a little bit healthier for you and it's not so many carbs from past that but past in itself isn't bad for you it's just when you overconsume so. yep so anything in itself is not going to be bad for you it's when you overconsume so to rectify that issue, I would just take one serving. and eat that serving and then drink like a full glass of water or a glass of milk because it's going to fill you up. And then wait for like 15 minutes and see if you're still hungry if you're still hungry take like a half a serving. You know, and that kind of thing because sometimes your brain doesn't turn on your. i'm full receptors for 20 minutes after you're done eating then your brain says okay i'm full otherwise, if you eat during that time, a lot of times you're eating and you really are fall if that makes sense."
9970.0,Patient,yeah I remember um what's the word. i'm worried about my my physical and health overall. Okay i'm also kind of worried about gain weight on too much. i'm trying to get back on exercising.
706.0,Provider,"So exercises as simply as going out and taking a walk around the block, you know, once a day you know."
9970.0,Patient,i'm. I have a little bit of a gut room with me and I think I need to do certain types of exercises. walking doesn't.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so have you have you been doing any kind of physical activity, now they have you been walking have you been doing anything."
9970.0,Patient,That has been walking i'm like for about I go outside go for a walk for about 30 minutes on come back home.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, and how often are you doing that."
9970.0,Patient,Every day.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's good so you know that's a good start, so you don't want to go from kind of like being a couch potato, so to say, to going, you know full stride into working out because you know your body's not used to it. So walking is a good way to just kind of build up your endurance so if you're doing if you're doing 30 minutes, maybe increase it to 45 minutes you know and try and try and build up that endurance."
9970.0,Patient,yeah but if i'm going to be out longer i'm going to one my parents i'll be going for longer walks and. When.
706.0,Provider,You have a cell phone right.
9970.0,Patient,I do.
706.0,Provider,"yeah so just let them know hey i'm going to go for like a 45 minute walk I have my phone so if anything happens i'll call you or if you, you know are worried call me, you know that kind of thing. it's just about the communication and then i'm you know sitting down and just figuring out what types of foods you like, do you like any kind of fruits."
9970.0,Patient,"I like apples, bananas and strawberries and. that's."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so maybe get those kinds of foods and when you want a snack eat those that's gonna be far better for you than eating something that's unhealthy for you um do you like any kind of vegetables."
9970.0,Patient,"Well that's The other thing i'm fruit is good for you, but it still has a lot of sugar in it and it's natural sugar."
706.0,Provider,"It has its natural sugars so it's better for you than eating, something that has. Processed sugar so when you if you eat a serving of fruit versus are serving as something with processed sugar serving a fruit is far better for you, because it's all natural. So it's not there's no sugar added, whereas something that you buy at a store that has sugar in it has typically sugar processed oh it's not natural."
9970.0,Patient,"uh huh. Oh. Hello. Oh. Yes, you can you hear me."
706.0,Provider,hey.
9970.0,Patient,"Sorry, you froze."
706.0,Provider,"yeah you froze to that was weird um so yeah so you just want to make sure you're making healthier choices um. So that way when you do eat it's not you don't feel like you're eating terrible so and you can eat anything so the whole the whole prospect of. dieting or staying away from things is the wrong way to look at you're wanting to change into a healthier lifestyle, you want to look at it, as. Food is to fuel your body so that's what it's for it's not an enemy or it's not. You know something that is pleasurable so when people see food as giving them like pleasure, or being a coping skill, they do more about, especially in times of stress, because it makes them feel good and it's like that soothing thing. But if you look at it, as just fuel like when you drive a car you put gas in it and you'll feel for your car."
9970.0,Patient,Okay.
706.0,Provider,"And that's what food is to your body is it as fuel, so you want to make sure you get enough of it, so that you can you know fuel your body. And so the key to getting to that point of moderation, I guess is simply looking at what you eat throughout the day so for a whole for like the next week, I want you to keep a food Journal of everything that you eat throughout the day. Every time you eat I want you to write it down because what that's going to do is going to tell you, your patterns of eating."
9970.0,Patient,So I can't like servings to or the entire thing that I.
706.0,Provider,"Like if you have pastor and you have one serving you know put one serving a pastor, but if you look for server and pastor say four servings of pasta, does that make sense. yeah so and The thing is, as you said, when you take your magic don't eat very much so what's happening is your body is thinking it's starving. Because you're not feeding it, the amount of calories that it needs so then when you so then it hoards whatever it has because it's like I don't know when I get to eat again."
9970.0,Patient,sorry about that.
706.0,Provider,"yeah and so, then the next time that you eat. Because you forget to take your meds and you're like you're super hungry, because your body hasn't eaten so it's like eat eat eat eat. But anything that you eat it's just going to stick in you you're not going to burn it off because you're writing like I need to hold on to this because I don't know what to eat again. So, right now, your body's doing this, and so it's like a roller coaster so what you want to do is get it is what it stable so that's why I said. You know, eating, at the same time, every day, and like scheduling your food intake so you know, maybe eating breakfast at 8am and then you know, having a snack at like 10am. A healthy snack and then eating again at 12pm have your lunch and then have a snack again at like two or 3pm and just so that your body has that steady amount of energy all day long. And then it knows what to expect So then, when you go out for your walk you'll start to burn calories and fat because they'll say Oh well, I get to eat again, so I can let some of this go I don't need to hold on to it."
9970.0,Patient,Okay.
706.0,Provider,Does that make sense.
9970.0,Patient,"It does, I have these talks one mom exactly the same way. yeah and. yeah like I said i'm just worried about myself, because I have more of my mom's side and she has diabetes running in her family."
706.0,Provider,"So and there's you know, two different types of diabetes there's the diabetes that as more hereditary and then there's diabetes, that you develop due to you know unhealthy lifestyle."
9970.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,"You know so but The thing is, is, I mean the best thing that you can do for you and you'll feel better too, so if you're if you're feeling your body regularly throughout the day you're going to feel less sluggish. you're going to feel less foggy like sometimes I don't know if you know notice when you don't eat like you kind of get foggy maybe like you're you're thinking and stuff kind of gets foggy. Or you feel kind of like sluggish and that's because you have no fuel in your body to make it run. So you have to put you have to put food into your body and it's not so much what you put in it, but the amount, so if you want to have. Like if you're craving a piece of cake today, and you eat that piece of cake that's fine just don't eat five of them and don't eat them for the next week don't eat a piece of cake every day for the next week, does that make sense. So if you deprive yourself of things, then you'll overindulge So if you say i'm not going to eat any sweets any ice cream any cake any cookies any anything i'm done i'm not having any of it. Then, your body you're going to crave it and crave it and crave crave it and then the next time that you. do have a cookie or a piece of cake, or something like that you're going to overindulge because you have been depriving yourself, whereas if you have a craving for ice cream and you take a scoop of ice cream and you eat it you saw that craving that you don't overindulge. So it's not what you eat it's how much and how often."
9970.0,Patient,"Okay. What else to talk about oh yeah I started becoming a lot more social online I started to make new friends, a voice chat on. software. online."
706.0,Provider,"And that's out there, I mean are they are healthy people."
9970.0,Patient,"i'm. Sorry. um yeah well, some of them there when I was on the server with them, as I was talking chatting with them, some of them were autistic and they have the same troubles and went to the same stuff as I did."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so they have similar issues that you have. Like support network."
9970.0,Patient,i'm sure.
706.0,Provider,it's kind of like a support network.
9970.0,Patient,"Oh no it's not. No it's a it's a an APP called discord and then has like custom made servers that people make themselves to make like a group of people to come over and chat, though, the one that I saw was called the anti social society."
706.0,Provider,"Okay. it's kind of an interesting name, why do you think they call it that."
9970.0,Patient,"Because they'll and they're just like me they they have a hard time socializing with them people i'm like trying to make the first move on the compensation. Okay, I even told him about a time when a kid walked over to me back at school and was like in my backpack is this kid doing talking to us and as sat on staff to me i'm always trying to make friends and then I introduced myself. mm hmm that's how I think people will think of us if we try to talk to them."
706.0,Provider,Okay okay. So you get anxious.
9970.0,Patient,I won't say anxious more like. nervous. Because I won't feel like i'm annoying or something like that.
706.0,Provider,"um. So you get nervous than that maybe you're going to annoy them or interrupt them or maybe they don't want to talk to you or won't like you, that kind of thing."
9970.0,Patient,So my bad.
706.0,Provider,"Okay um. So then, how do you get past that."
9970.0,Patient,I have it's either they have to talk to me and that's it I can't make the first. move for the conversation.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so what if you did make the first move to further conversation."
9970.0,Patient,"Well, going back to the discord server thing I just sit there until someone actually joins the chat it's and I just sit there wait do my own thing and then, when I hear someone talking like. hey how's it going. I don't have that much confident my voice."
706.0,Provider,Okay. So do you think it would be beneficial to you to learn how to be that person that makes that first move and says hey how you doing my name is Arthur.
9970.0,Patient,"Oh, by the way, I don't use my actual name i'm talking to them."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so what name, do you use."
9970.0,Patient,I go by my pen name Theodore.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so be like hey how you doing my name is Theodore do you think that would be beneficial to you, to be able to do that."
9970.0,Patient,"Well, yes, I do make the first move when I talked to them, but as time as the conversation goes on and we can talk and talk, then I get more comfortable. With the conversation. My mom you and tell me how I. Am building on talking and conversation and just I just don't know how to start them."
706.0,Provider,"uh huh so starting a conversation so like let's say somebody comes into the room and and you're like just introducing yourself like hey my name is Theodore you know how are you doing today or how's it going or whatever that's I mean that's going to start a conversation. And they'll be like oh hi my name is blah blah blah i'm Okay, you know and then try and find a common ground so something that you really like is like illustrations and that kind of stuff. So you might say something like hey you know, do you like you know comic books or be like. graphics or you know or hey what are you into like what do you like, what do you do in your spare time you know just to try and find a common ground because maybe you'll find somebody with your same interests. And then you'll be off because you'll be able to talk about that for hours because it's something you're interested in."
9970.0,Patient,"yeah that's what i'm that's what happened, I did my first joined the server and we talked for about like four hours, until we called it a day."
706.0,Provider,Oh wow that's awesome.
9970.0,Patient,"yeah I don't like they're like me there well well some for the time being there like me they're young they're artistic not not all of them are are and some of them, this is an interesting thing I just want to point out some of them don't speak other languages and from other countries. They are in talking and over soon, because they don't know English that well."
706.0,Provider,"So yes, I mean. I guess one way to look at it, as you are nervous and they're nervous so that's that's something you have in common is just being nervous talking to each other. But if you can I kind of a common ground of an interest, you know that's how that's how friendships are belt typically you know you talk to somebody. And you have something in common, something that you can talk about and you get along really well and that's how you build friendships so you just need to get those icebreaker conversations out of the way. And those are just your real simple, you know how high, are you how are you, you know what do you do you know, do you have a job, do you go to school, what, what do you like to do in your free time, what are your hobbies you know."
9970.0,Patient,yeah it's basically i'm the go to questions.
706.0,Provider,yeah. yeah.
9970.0,Patient,"and Like I said before, when I was talking to them, we even talked about like our struggles back when we were in school like I said one Peter was autistic like me and I told him about my awful days back in middle school and he told me about his awful days back in. School in general."
706.0,Provider,"And how can be can be therapeutic so even though it's not like a support room or anything like that, like a support group. You really are both of you, providing each other support because you're listening to each other's stories and then you're giving you know feedback. Or you know and those types of things and that's really what a support group is is when you listen to people's stories and their struggles and you give them, you know positive, encouraging feedback."
9970.0,Patient,"yeah and. yeah we even talk about some of the things that. That was just weird and wacky and random just to make the conversation interesting like I told him about weird band name, so I find on the Internet. So."
706.0,Provider,"um so that's great so how did you feel I mean like after you made that connection, and you had that commonality and you were able to have that conversation, how did you feel."
9970.0,Patient,"It yeah um it fell on great and we even um kept our wiki context, so we. know where we're often on there every day, I decided to look for a random server to find people chat with them physically. Not like typing typing so. I decided to look for like any type of server like I just chose. Like I said. It first started, I was a video game server but then it went to. Anti social society server. And then. I went to the voice chat channel, and then we talked for like I said about four hours, until we called her the day."
706.0,Provider,"So um you know, the one thing that I want you to remember when you're in these chat rooms on these random servers as just be safe and you're not using your real name so that's good. um you know don't count any personal information about yourself um you know just make sure you're being safe, because some people aren't who they seem, some people are, but some people aren't you know what I mean and I."
9970.0,Patient,want you.
706.0,Provider,To be safe and not taken advantage of by somebody that's in there for the wrong reasons.
9970.0,Patient,yeah so. And what else is there. it's kind of hard for me to actually talk to people sometimes because it's aware of cases where people can actually. have time to actually chat physically.
706.0,Provider,hmm.
9970.0,Patient,"For me, I just go on the server go into that channel wait do I draw or something I can even sold them my my screen is sold them when i'm working on."
706.0,Provider,huh.
9970.0,Patient,yeah and. I can watch what they're doing on their computer they can watch what i'm doing I even. I even found my webcam I didn't show my face I had it covered uh huh yeah.
706.0,Provider,So um. Do you ever feel like maybe you'd want to go out and physically meet people.
9970.0,Patient,So million dollar question I don't really know I just feel more comfortable at home.
706.0,Provider,"mm hmm so would it be. Something that you might be open to so I know here i'm an iowa so obviously it's different than wait, where you are, but we have. These places are called like day haves and basically people that are have you know, are on the spectrum like that have autism disorder or people that have certain mental illnesses. People that maybe have some sort of disability they go to these centers during the day and there's like different activities and you get to meet people and they do sometimes they do like field trips places sometimes they do crafts, sometimes they play games. You know, but you just get to interact with people that are that are similar to you and your barriers have you ever thought of maybe looking for something like that."
9970.0,Patient,i'll look into that.
706.0,Provider,"And you can you know make some make some like actual physical friends, you know, in your community."
9970.0,Patient,"Well, I guess."
706.0,Provider,"So that might be something to look into I don't know what you have there, but that might be an option to look into."
9970.0,Patient,"It sounds kind of like um. I don't know what to look for Ashley the same thing, like I know there's a boys and girls club ymca."
706.0,Provider,"mm hmm those are different, I mean those are also great places to go and interact with people but you're going to have just you know every people, some people might have certain barriers like you have. But then other people might not have any so when you go to a day have the reason that they're there is because they qualify for that service, for whatever reason, whether they be. That they have autism disorder, whether they be that they have some kind of a mental health issue or a physical disability or maybe they have. An intellectual disability, whatever it may be, it qualifies them to be in that kind of programming. Then there's like people there that are like workers that facilitate it so they facilitate kind of the activities and things like that. So it might be interesting to to look into and I think a lot of places at least here. You can like go visit them and see what it's like to see if it would even be something you're interested in so um. You know, might be something you know, but to think about and, if you want to look into something like that I can help you try and research, if you have anything like that in your area."
9970.0,Patient,"One thing I want to go to is when this whole covert stuff ends, I like conventions."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, that would be good, that would get you around people that have the same interest absolutely."
9970.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,thing really has kind of. Put a crimp in everybody's ability to do anything social. Hopefully it's going to get better.
9970.0,Patient,fingers crossed.
706.0,Provider,"yeah exactly so um Have you had been struggling with anything over the last couple of weeks, besides that the eating and sleeping."
9970.0,Patient,i'm. Always doing some sort of selling.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, good good i'm not not feeling really depressed or anything like that."
9970.0,Patient,hmm I wouldn't say the press for like disappointed.
706.0,Provider,disappointed and what.
9970.0,Patient,"I know how the things are turning out for. The world right now but that's out of my control, so I tried to ignore it."
706.0,Provider,"yeah yep it's the circles of control, you can control the things you can and the things that you can't control. You know you just have to realize, not to worry about them because there's nothing that you can really do you can only do what you can do so, like if you're worried for. instance about the environment, well, you can recycle that's something that you can do to help it, but you can't control what's going to happen to it."
9970.0,Patient,To understand what i'm saying yeah.
706.0,Provider,"Anything that you're worried about if there's a simple if there's a small thing that you can do to make yourself feel better that you're helping that situation, you know the go ahead and do that, but if, but then that's all you can. You froze up are you there."
9970.0,Patient,yeah i'm fine you went deaf.
706.0,Provider,"So yeah so just know those circles love control the things you can control the things that you can't. And some of the things you can control, you can contribute to positively like you can recycle. You can you know cut down the amount of water you use things like that, like if you're talking about like environmental things you know. If you're worried about coven when you go out, you can wear a mask even if you are vaccinated because you know they're saying wear a mask anyway, so you can help in that way I can't control how many Kobe today."
9970.0,Patient,uh huh.
706.0,Provider,So um so yeah so just know you know kind of way those those. Those boundaries are for you.
9970.0,Patient,"Okay, so."
706.0,Provider,Anything else.
9970.0,Patient,um let's say we've talked about my eating habits my sleeping problem my worry about my physical health um my social interactions going going um another tip that's all.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, that sounds good um so have you made another appointment."
9970.0,Patient,um no not Apps do it after this one.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so just go into the BC and they'll help you set up your future appointments."
9970.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you."
706.0,Provider,"All right, take care of this week's."
