17475.0,Patient,"I would say my mood has been like the same I haven't really noticed any major changes. But one thing that I do, I have noticed, I feel like i've become kind of more like quick to anger like I kind of go. either. I don't know if it's because my medication."
759.0,Provider,"Okay, so you're a little bit more irritated unusual."
17475.0,Patient,Is that wrong.
759.0,Provider,"Day okay yeah so it can be you know i'm not too sure if that's a side effect. Of the medication. It just could be that you're kind of you know, like you know tell me the situations that you feel like a little bit more irritated about."
17475.0,Patient,"um I don't know how to explain that, just like. i'm like snappy like if someone told me something I kind of answer. You know unnecessarily mean."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
17475.0,Patient,And then I stopped myself and i'm like whoa what was that about.
759.0,Provider,"yeah so you stop. yourself, can you just like was that about okay. yeah Okay, well, it could be that you're you know you need you're not getting you know, like something that you might need such as. You know by cuz there's such a thing as resting but. Also relaxation, you know, like. Being in a better mood yourself like maybe you're just not in a good mood. You know yourself like. Even the price so sometimes ear to build teams, the symptom of depression so maybe it's just because of your mood you know it's not necessarily because of the medication or anything of that nature it's just that you've been depressed you know so. buzzing about maybe some coping skills that can help. Your depression, I think we went over some last week. You know, like in terms of how you're you're filling we talked about maybe exercise right, you know getting outside the House and maybe going for a walk have you been able to. do that."
17475.0,Patient,"yeah um so in my little town there isn't like really any to do. They just opened up like a store and i've been going over there, just like look at. The new stuff that they're working around yeah."
759.0,Provider,yeah so just walking around the store okay nice I know this is like you said some little town so it's not too much to do much about just taking them walking just listening to music does that help.
17475.0,Patient,um I haven't tried working with listening to music.
759.0,Provider,"Okay, or maybe does that sound like something you might want to do. yeah okay good good yeah and the morning, you can you know get up and get out I think it's the for the better, and I know it doesn't sound like it's too much to do, like in your small town. You know, like I lived in a very small town before and yeah sometimes it's just one store couple stores and the gas station, or something like that and that said. You know, are maybe a little mall strip or something like that so it's kind of hard, do you drive."
17475.0,Patient,"I do have my license but for some reason I. can't have like an aversion to driving. yeah I only drive, if I have to, but I don't I really don't like driving."
759.0,Provider,You really don't like driving okay this. Is a kind of like anxiety that gets in the way of driving. Our car isn't.
17475.0,Patient,It yeah.
759.0,Provider,yeah yeah yeah and what do you think the anxiety stems from.
17475.0,Patient,"i've thought a lot about it, and I think it's because when I was younger my parents. there's like there's myself and then, I have two younger brothers, besides me and a little sister. well. For a while there was just the three of us and the two young my two younger brothers, they were always taught to drive. before me and. Being in a Mexican household there's it's very kind of sexist and. My my dad would always tell me like i'm too stupid to drive like there's no point in teaching me how to drive."
759.0,Provider,"So, if you would teach."
17475.0,Patient,He would teach my brothers yeah so. As I got older I like barely didn't get my license so like two months ago um yeah.
759.0,Provider,yeah and.
17475.0,Patient,I kind of had to teach myself how to drive.
759.0,Provider,"So you really don't have too much direction and you might, since you didn't have too much direction might not feel comfortable behind the world right."
17475.0,Patient,Right exactly.
759.0,Provider,"yeah because he I haven't. had too many opportunities and probably to drive. You know, so you don't feel as comfortable and confident in your driving skills. Right yeah. Okay well you know, like all you can do is try, you know, like maybe the goal can be I will drive to one place each week you know just one place, you know, like so that you become a little bit more confident in your driving you know because. it's a good skill to know you know, in terms of how you know getting around and different things and. And you want to keep those skills up. And that's good that you, you you passed your driving test so that must mean that you know something right."
17475.0,Patient,You know you're able to.
759.0,Provider,"pass the driving test so that's really good how old, are you Jennifer."
17475.0,Patient,I will be 22 in September.
759.0,Provider,"Okay, so yeah later on in life or not live later on you're still very. fairly young you know. And, but you know, some people. Learn i'm younger younger age, but. You guys. You know at 22 and that's fine you know. yeah yeah. Okay when's your birthday."
17475.0,Patient,September 5.
759.0,Provider,"Also to manifest so you'd be 23 and September, the fifth okay."
17475.0,Patient,Are we trying to.
759.0,Provider,"All you'd be turning 22. Just share your 21. Okay okay. So you return yeah you're 21 okay. yeah so you're a virgo so timber fifth. All you know because I have a sister's birthday it's around that age around that time. yeah okay. yeah if you can like I said just go out do driving activity once a week, you know, I think that would be good, on your self esteem too yeah. yeah yeah okay so i'm trying to think back when I was 21 I had a lot of the different things going on. So, you said that it's hard for you to make some friends right or you don't have any friends."
17475.0,Patient,don't have friends.
759.0,Provider,"You can don't have friends. And I know that must be hard, especially since you live in such a small town it's probably hard to make friends right."
17475.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,yeah how you ever like what's the nearest big town near you.
17475.0,Patient,be an Oregon comical.
759.0,Provider,Oh yeah you told me that so that's the nearest big town. And that's kind of like how far if a guy is that.
17475.0,Patient,i'm probably like half an hour.
759.0,Provider,"Half an hour 30 minutes. and Do you have tell me again, what are you kind of like the hobbies and things that you'd like to do."
17475.0,Patient,um. I really are probably a home. yeah. I used to. Be into art a lot. yeah. I used to like going to the gym I haven't done that in a while. I like listening to music.
759.0,Provider,"Listening music okay. Okay, so what kind of artistic things did you like to do."
17475.0,Patient,I really like drawing and like painting.
759.0,Provider,So dry and painting.
17475.0,Patient,Okay.
759.0,Provider,Do you think you might want to get back into doing that.
17475.0,Patient,Maybe it's just like I haven't felt the motivation to start doing it.
759.0,Provider,"Like maybe I don't know if you have money like buying maybe a drawing you know notepad and maybe gain some pencils are maybe gain some coloring supplies coloring supplies on. paint supplies, you know, like just something of interest to you, and maybe doing that activity once a day you know doing something artistic."
17475.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,"Okay yeah by guy I feel like the morning, you can do for yourself in terms of you know, applying some things that you'd like to do. You know, like, I know you probably with the depression, we have little interests of doing things, but I think the more you can incorporate some of the things that you'd like to do. And then maybe you know, once you start working getting some more money, you can maybe join like a meetup group, how you ever heard of meetup groups."
17475.0,Patient,or not.
759.0,Provider,"they're kind of like a groups of people need up and they have similar. interest as you do, and they meet up and they've joined together and they do activities together kind of like painting together, are you know doing. there's a lot of art groups out there, you know so maybe you can join and you're near cities and Oregon very minutes away Maybe you can find similar people you know who like doing things so to like to do, and you can it's the APP it's called me up. And you can download. And you can see what kind of groups are near near to so that's that's going to be your homework, I want you to download that APP it's called me up. yeah yeah."
17475.0,Patient,"Alright, it in my notes written."
759.0,Provider,"Okay, good. yeah and I think if we can taylor's like your interest to kind of like you know to to kind of give you some coping skills, you know to do both the everyday stuff and being you know doing our petunia in a different headspace you know that creative headspace. where you can kind of like be you know distracted from whatever might be going on, internally and just being having an outlet, you know to say express yourself, through your art I think that's a good way you know, so if you have money, please get another you know, drawing pad get some. arts of pies and just go from there, and maybe that's something you can do every single day."
17475.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,"i'm trying to show you my coloring book I have on the floor, this is something I do kind of like. Almost daily and it's just like. You know just doing calling work and different things of that nature inside like. yeah so just like little stuff like this, you know, like a duck adult coloring book but it's just it seems like a small practice, but it has great reward you know, in terms of how you fail, you know, so if you're able to do that for yourself, you know, like, I think that would be really good."
17475.0,Patient,yeah i'll definitely try that.
759.0,Provider,"Okay, good good. um what other symptoms of depression, do you feel like you feel from day to day. Besides the air to build you."
17475.0,Patient,"um. I would say, like probably one of the most. difficult things that I struggle with as far as depression goes is like. The current has to do with like my body and."
759.0,Provider,"Your body image. And yeah you get to know before that you would get bullied over the way that you looked because he was because of your small frame. yeah yeah. How tall, are you."
17475.0,Patient,i'm trying to.
759.0,Provider,Your to your one inch taller into me. So you're fine. i'm pretty sure. yeah so tell me a little bit more about the bullying and how that makes you fell.
17475.0,Patient,"Was it was kind of like constantly each time you know it goes school. And at home, even like even my parents would kind of make fun of me for that. But yeah I would just be like oh like. I want to go to school and go eat a burger or you know you're so skinny like you look like a twig like a skeleton. and Even when people kind of set it as a compliment there would just be like really backhanded you know. yeah yeah like. Like you, so skinny you know, like the way they said, it is just like. Just rude. Like I think it's really rude to just comment on anyone's party. yeah yeah. But yeah but that affect me this and. I feel like now I just kind of like take apart everything about myself. And it's really difficult. To like go out and like make friends, because of it, because i'm so so conscious about it. yeah."
759.0,Provider,yeah what's one thing that you can appreciate about from body.
17475.0,Patient,"Well, that it's healthy."

759.0,Provider,"You know so just learning how to just appreciate the small things that your body does for yourself. You know keeps you live cutesy breathing keeps you going, you know, like in terms of that so just appreciating the body for what it is, you know, like, even though I know, especially with social media, we have so many. kind of you know, like. Body image, you know of different people who, like a certain type of way and and if we're don't look like that it's kind of hard for us to kind of like appreciate, you know our own be in the sense to appreciate our own selves for our own uniqueness. I want you to follow our your instagram. No, no you're not instagram. This month really good page supportive cut is called I way and then basically has a lot of body positivity and different games.
