14504.0,Patient,"So I started experiencing really bad like depressive symptoms last November and I went and saw. a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with anxiety and depression, and so I was given lexapro and I think I took that daily for. For three months, and I just felt very muted and not like myself and kind of terrible so I was like okay I didn't want, so I stopped taking them and I didn't really want to and then my son started getting really crazy and weird. And then I decided my family encouraged me they actually accused me of being on drugs they my therapist now thought I was in a very manic state, but they were like you've done meth have you are you like on crack or anything else i've never even tried those. And, but they were accusing me of that, and so they were about to that point where they're where they're going to write me off forever or they were going to like try to get way more involved in helping me. And i'm really glad I chose the latter because I ended up, seeing that therapist he ended up. corroborating kind of what he's like oh yeah you know what I don't think the antidepressants would actually be good for for you, I think you might have bipolar and would love for you to get to talk, some of you can you know shredding machine. And then, this is all within the last like month."

14504.0,Patient,"Terrible I blocked out most of it. I was homeschooled until fifth grade So my first year of public school was my last year of elementary school, which made it very challenging for me socially. So I didn't really have a leg to stand on when I got to middle school and was bullied quite a bit, so I yeah I don't really recall most since middle school."
214.0,Provider,"All right, so when we stopped the high school what happened now."
14504.0,Patient,perpetuating to me kind of not running around like the best influences my freshman and sophomore year and then junior year I don't know I just decided to get it together there I joined like sb.

214.0,Provider,awesome congrats.
14504.0,Patient,Thank you. significantly less than you had to do.
214.0,Provider,"Well here's the point I think what we don't take time, I mean we've got a big distance between ages, but. My kids are older than you, but the point I was trying to make was you know, sometimes we we minimize the things we accomplish. As if we need to compare it to someone else like i'm not saying you're comparing yourself to me, but the reality is you know when we don't take time to like accolade the little things, then the big things like seem like not even important so i'm just. that's a stressor. it's like a reflection, for me, when people do this like everything's in accomplishment you know. Someone fills out of school and they go to trade school become a plumber it's an accomplishment like so okay like i'm you know. i'm not good at math I definitely am not going into the map industry, so I want to just support you in things that you know, maybe you're not reflective of and you need to take a minute because, whether you are bipolar or not. The facts is this you still accomplish great things right, so this this isn't this isn't like the ultimate lemon car like shit I got stuck with this model life we can really get through this. Okay cool."
14504.0,Patient,"Thank you, I appreciate that a lot."
214.0,Provider,you're welcome so at no military right. No financial legal concerns no. In a relationship.
14504.0,Patient,I have i'm like i'm like casually dating somebody but not really.
214.0,Provider,Not. You say SEC I bought.
14504.0,Patient,"A few months ago, so."
214.0,Provider,How how long were you married.
14504.0,Patient,Two years.
214.0,Provider,Do you think. That the fracture you're trying to deal with today played any part in our relationship.
14504.0,Patient,"The like like what look what I feel like i've been dealing with mentally if that impacted my relationship ending I do think so, yes, but I think that it. yeah there was she had no desire to it wasn't so much that I was acting differently, is that when I started having symptoms, she started treating me very differently and then ended up cheating on me so. So yeah absolutely did, but it was just a struggle that I was going through and that is how she decided to handle it so and it's not something i'm super concerned with, I guess, we are going to short true colors every now and then."
214.0,Provider,"I think the what the reflection is you know, sometimes we don't think what we're presenting with. that's a responsibility, we only responsibility to what we're presenting with someone may have a different reaction to and then do something of a negative behavior that's not permission. that's not right it's not moral character, but you know, every time chemistry change someone else's present to do something either positive or negative. Right right so that goes out one alright, so no children."
14504.0,Patient,No.
214.0,Provider,Who do you live with.
14504.0,Patient,"I live by myself, we split custody of the dog I have him today."
214.0,Provider,"Oh that's awesome love. dogs got mine too alright so here's the deal, are you going to continue to see your therapist on the outside. Yes, Okay, so now, I need to look at this. Oh that's you. awesome so I spoke to Mr Marino yesterday."
14504.0,Patient,"Oh, you did so, are you the therapist for bright heart right Okay, you see, I really liked talking to you a lot so that's pretty cool maybe I didn't even bother you."
214.0,Provider,"it's totally up to you, but. He was very respectful I have to tell you that, and I know what i'm asking is against the law, because he doesn't know you signed a consent. So I said to him listen we're both in the show, he was like who are you and i'm like okay i'm in the same bag you I can't tell you much but. let's wait for you to me with him and then we'll figure it out, so if you want to continue to see him I support you, you want to see me I support but i'll need to talk to them so supposedly you're supposed to meet with a Monday."
14504.0,Patient,yep.
214.0,Provider,"So you can tell them hey this guy man he's going to call you can tell him, you see me and that will absolve you from seeing me a bright heart. So I don't know what she did on the flip side of this so that's what some people do like you know what I don't know, maybe I should do both and i'm like you figure it out, you let me know i'm good either way. My job is to. resolve an issue when a person says this is outside therapists, we have to have a verbal confirmation."
14504.0,Patient,"So do I took my video off because I don't want my sound to cut up but. This has been a really great call I was actually very frustrated with bright heart, I didn't know that the the prescriptions were one week, at a time, and so my very first group session was supposed to be on Monday, which was Labor day."
214.0,Provider,And it was pretty bad.
14504.0,Patient,"yeah, and so it got cancelled and I wasn't able to refill my prescription so even though i've been so consistent for the last week, taking it i've actually felt better. I wasn't able to get it yesterday, I called in sick two hours on the zoom with them, trying to get admitted. I paid my co page at all my stuff and then they still didn't meet with me at disconnected than the office closed, and so I missed a day of taking my medicine yesterday as a result of that."
214.0,Provider,"hold on for a woman, I am listened to everything you're saying, but we. Were gonna we're gonna do a little expedited. up in the front line type of thing, so I just sent you my email. Okay, you ever run into an issue like that you, you contact me ASAP i'll contact the prescriber ASAP and will resolve it."
14504.0,Patient,Okay.
214.0,Provider,"I know what the policies and by heart, I respect the policy, but I also know, like. I need my new heart now and I really can't wait for you guys to figure out where it's at like either we got this will we don't and medication when someone's taking in. And the mere fact that you believe, or you know you're doing well on on one day miss was started and again so it's not a good relationship at this point."
14504.0,Patient,"I don't know from you, but it came through blank with no subject."
214.0,Provider,yeah it is it's just for you to know I tell I get in touch with manny it's just for you to know what my email.
14504.0,Patient,Okay well right.
214.0,Provider,"Alright, so I see her prescriptions, I know what she's given you. Okay, so i'll take care of that for you i'll get her on this today because I your west coast to right. yeah i'll good I actually meet with her 6pm West Coast time so she has no. hello, I am on with. me. yeah I know that Dr REX line. is not as big as it should be so you got everybody in now, so let me see what she tells me. i'm actually communicating with them now, so we should get this resolved, you should be able to pick up your prescription within the hour two hours."
14504.0,Patient,that's awesome Thank you so much.
214.0,Provider,"No, no problem alright so i'm going to call Marina on Monday for verbal confirmation. Okay, so let's just go over your depression, anxiety score what happens if I tell you I think this is situational."
14504.0,Patient,situational situational.
214.0,Provider,"So here's the thing. Someone will say I got the pressure and i'm like in do you sleep, do you sleep yeah I can sleep pretty easily do you baby yeah do you go to work yeah I do yeah. You don't got no depression, at that point what it is, is we feel hopeless we don't think the world is really great this there's different ways to look at the pressure I don't like just broad stroke depression, anxiety and anxiety and depression work off of each other. They feel each other. terribly so if you're starting to get anxious next thing you know you're getting depressed and the depression kicks back like this thing is pink box so with That said, you know your scores are high, but also you haven't been medicated. So it'll be interesting to see oh. Can I tell him. ready. So this is good. Thank you for now you're very welcome and in listen I think it's very important. I know people find it difficult, but if so i'm part of a couple of different teams and leadership if we don't hear what's going on, we can't make any fixes. And i'm being dead serious. And, and we know we know this is chronic and do we like it no, but we need to really work harder and addressing. Especially when it comes to medications what is the urgency of that line versus the urgency of hey I didn't get my urine called two different parameters of urgency, one is like on the spectrum of 1000 the other one is like right now. Right so i'm trying to open up your question here so again i'll talk to Marina on on Monday for verbal confirmation. arm and then you'll decide how you want to. Progress from there Okay, you say Oh, she sent it now. hero Thank you yep, so I would say, by time you get off of me, which is about seven minutes you're good to go."
14504.0,Patient,awesome Thank you.
214.0,Provider,"you're welcome so now, I see something the club one I real quick what is up with the irregular heartbeat."
14504.0,Patient,"I was drinking a lot of caffeine in. High School, I would like, we would stay up all night drinking mountain dew and stuff and it literally started giving me like a little bit of a regular pattern. And then I cut out coffee for all of the rest of high school and college and then I some sort of started to drink it again and I haven't really had a significant issues with it, since."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, fine all right. just looking at the answers you guys want to listen for for my depression. stop taking a good. You know. What is the traumatic brain injury or head injury."
14504.0,Patient,Did I say I mean i've gotten two concussions.
214.0,Provider,From.
14504.0,Patient,One of them was from slipping and falling on ice and the other one was from doing a backflip on a pool and I hit my head on the side of the pool and I like blackout and woke up in the pool.
214.0,Provider,i'm assuming there has been no. hospital further investigation for like a traumatic brain injury and you. What do you think's going on with you eating.
14504.0,Patient,"um I i've been trying to eat, as if I can even humanly speaking like stomach ache food, I will put it as much as in my body, as I can, I have been averaging less than a meal a day for like three months. So I lost a lot of weight and I really so now whenever I even whenever I can get an inkling of like who I might be able to eat right now i'll just kind of eat as much as I can just to give my body, if you will, like I. I couldn't walk around I felt so lethargic I think i'd actually developed like anorexia just the way that that I was looking at my body. And the way that it described that online and like how I see I was trying to hit this target weight that was really uncomfortable to be like I felt sick and I was still trying to lose weight as like weighing myself constantly literally every it was awful so."
214.0,Provider,Now you using that as a distraction or an emotional control.
14504.0,Patient,Probably yeah probably.
214.0,Provider,What we'll just we'll just think about that i'm gonna hold that because you've been through a lot. Thank you. Tobacco I know about alcohol on over a mountain or no bar. Know abuse. bachelor's now full time employee us. are used to be charged past years. recorded a novel wow that's pretty cool.
14504.0,Patient,"Thank you, I didn't know I put that in there."
214.0,Provider,"That that's why we reviewed this few like why like yeah i'm just looking at your answers and make something wrong I can't lie. So 76 is an uncomfortable question I need to ask it you already answered I need a little more specifics, have you ever experienced on wanted sexual tension."
14504.0,Patient,"I guess, so I guess no not not like physically, we have a pool here at our building, and I mean I do feel like I look better from I mean my body is at least like toned or whatever anyway, but yeah I just get like a lot of stairs a lot of comments, a lot of like things like."
214.0,Provider,"That fair enough. Okay, so, so this is fine, so now. let's just pull back the chart for a minute and take a look at. What Sharon and wrote and let's let's nail this down. hey ah. OK so here you are awesome. So you're supposed to be. On wrong tab. weekly groups only. Oh just surveys, which are important, you still have to do them. Well, and what's the girl who's your facilitator."
14504.0,Patient,I think it's her.
214.0,Provider,"it's just showing mm hmm. interesting. Okay. um I don't I mean everything is clean, so I will not set up another appointment to work with you i'll just i'll just verify with Mr Marina on Monday that he is I put a note, if that changes you got my email."
14504.0,Patient,"Okay, great cuz I mean I might talk to him about that um yeah yeah I think that's i'll chat with him and kind of see where we're at on that."
214.0,Provider,"yeah I I think he did you justice, honestly, because sometimes we know things, but you know, it is good to get the actual confirmation that adjustment medication. I just don't know what his game plan and I don't know your relationship with him, none of really my business right now, but you know that you can always come back to bright heart. yeah um and make sure that you're getting it's working for you just. I think you have some underlying other fractures I think you know I know you I didn't say you waved off to the voice for you kind of like it's over it's done with but. i'm assuming it's really not and now we share a dog so so it's a little bit of a stress fracture I think i'm too is you know what are your cues you don't do you even know what your cues on your stresses are right. So just just make sure that everything you're doing to help yourself, I know the medications appointment to but whatever marino's doing a showers don't make sure that's always a good fit. Okay well you know, and I always be available for you and you got to contact information, hopefully, she. See you don't have a prescription. She should be able to prescribe it one week, at a time. Okay, so she probably going to prescribe you to Monday. And then start you know the clock accurately so other than that that's all I got you have any questions for me."
14504.0,Patient,"I really appreciate your time, thank you very much."
214.0,Provider,"Thank you so much, I wish you all the best as well."
