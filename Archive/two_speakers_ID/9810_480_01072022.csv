Like the kids starting to come okay and i'm saying they start getting better, I can see difference in their attitude. And all that stuff and as soon as that one conversation goes and you can't expect shout out to say hey don't call your mom and i'm saying like. So I just had this i'm just really, really interesting about that, like you know i'm saying like I don't know what she's gonna do.

480.0,Provider,"Right, and I think it's important to to phrase it to them in a way, like it's not that you just became a Fuck up, so to speak, that was a trauma response because you didn't have the tools to cope. What you can do is you can give the kids the tools to cope, so they don't know."
9810.0,Patient,"Why i'm getting them in theory. yeah I told him with him god's word, a lot of is we don't know how to handle things I explained to them the situation when I was wanting to. worship thing and I needed that something from vital my husband I didn't know that what it was, I was like you're talking about there was, and she tells me. Oh you're looking for the answer, and you want to say yay or nay you don't want it and that's exactly what it was I couldn't put it in terms. So sometimes it takes explaining to somebody that. You know, and I was like and that's what you guys need, and we have to learn, we are all we're all going to this because we all have to learn, I mean learning your skills, you have to learn and I nobody taught them to me, so I have to go after go on, so I didn't eat me too. And, and you guys learn to, and now I want them to have them earlier on in life, so that they handle things more properly, you know that's what I told him, you know. I encourage even like i'm battling with my six year old i've been wanting to get there because he's going through things so his dad and. His dad tried to get into Georgia and bring send a picture of his high school diploma yeah absolutely nothing to do with to make it out like he's been some great dad.

9810.0,Patient,"And he does nothing for me bugging him so Sam key sales dope and girls okay that's what he does. And he got arrested down here in Georgia and he told his mom would say I call that lady. out, but you ever caught my son my son still waiting on pants and shoes from his freshman year in high school sweetie now had nothing to do with none of that. My husband foot the bill for that boy to go to that promise is Oscar home early but, as we know, Jason struggles with education. We want everybody to get that out of the ways he go ahead and get into a trade school where he can just learn when he asked you, and he enjoys your mechanics you know. doesn't like. he's 16 1617 X at first, I was like wait, I thought he was the little one I got my little man, but it's draining 16 but we paid him to go to. To get his high school diploma because jason's got ADHD he doesn't even saying he was starting to scourge, we first went to high school, he said mama there's a guy a boy mary's like 1920 years old, I don't want to be like that that a coven hit James on IV or she or. He anyways he was about to be honest third year at night right Okay, it happens credit he struggles that bad. It was all because I didn't expect him to sit down in front of us and i'm not a teacher. Sorry, no, I feel like we're either going to take this test and get. It I get ever ever ever until it does take about three times. For folic acid, which you pass it, which is all matters and now he can chime in on focus on education and get educated on what he's gonna need to make a life for him. You know i'm saying is that all these classes never going to use. yeah so I made a choice to let him do that you know i'm saying and horses Okay, unless I can go to high school because that's what society says it let's lose. I don't want to lose my son, because what somebody else thinks like so we're going to go and let him go to school, let him get as high school diploma. And now, he can just we can you know, make a little education class a little smaller now he can he can take focus education class education classes, because it's hard enough for he's a hands on person. You tell you the animal fucking box reports are you going to build something out of it, but you start throwing a bunch of numbers, and all this kind of crazy stuff man this. ain't never have to use a month 37 years of living he's on he's lost, you know, so I don't want him to discourage him, I felt like that was the best thing to do, but you're not. judging you don't even. come from I bet you don't have school. Really, are you know, like come on come up here, he wanted he wanted me to come to court drive to Georgia court, not much.

What I was gonna let it get you to that would be the extra spending money, but I still had to kick out for $2 for him to go on top by Christians for six other kids no problem, I made it, you know saying we would it would be i'd been playing this. For a long time. You know I had Chris was already I get Christmas and paperwork baby I already know you know i'm saying so. it's the point that, like that would have been extra for jaden you know, like you, didn't know it was they were waiting on you, you. never got guess, he says that he hasn't seen in 10 years you know and that meant a lot to us and I cried and seeing them two together, I made me i'm saying both of them need you know they both felt like a piece of the business and they're like twins or six weeks apart jaden this history.
