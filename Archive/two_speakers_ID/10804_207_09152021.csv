10804.0,Patient,"Alright, can you hear me."
207.0,Provider,I can hear you okay.
10804.0,Patient,it's Wednesday so wednesday's are always crazy children services just came in last and I don't have to deal with them no more yay.
207.0,Provider,"Well, let me see if I could get excited which you."
10804.0,Patient,know more children services.
207.0,Provider,that's good to see you.
10804.0,Patient,"You can all you see me. Yes, okay hold on. Oh, there we go."
207.0,Provider,There you go with.
10804.0,Patient,me my big bond.
207.0,Provider,"So she got that but also like listen take a look at the whole image. So, so what tell me what me throw let me know."
10804.0,Patient,"Basically, they said they were fighting for me out there, it children services and because they thought it was stupid that they have to come here every week or whatever, when I don't even have custody of my kid or anything like that and. And that I passed my drug screens and stuff and. Just basically said we bought for you out there and we won and decided that we're not going to mess with you know more, since. Jerry has full custody of kiwi you've passed your drug screens, we know kelly's well taken care of and she's happy healthy smart goes to school that's what you're supposed to do and um and so so we're not going to mess with you, no more, but she said, if if someone. Someone happens to call me again, because this has been. Three times this year since February, they came in February gave me a drug test I passed it and then, I guess, whoever called on me in February, seeing that I still had my kid. And so they called back again because it was the same allegations about me doing drugs and let my kid run the neighborhood or whatever and. So they came back again drug is asked it. Well, this would be four to four times, because then they came again was going to. Have me take the drug test or whatever, but, and then they said, well, we don't need to give you a drug test, because you don't have custody ever so. That would be pointless so then when they came this last time i'm like well why do I keep taking these drug test when I don't have custody ever and the last time you guys were here, he said I didn't have to because they have no cuz you. Know like we're just doing what the supervisor tells us to do and i'm like Okay, whatever that's fine and its mouth swab drug test or whatever. and So that done what they told me to do, and they said that if If so, my APP is a call again a come here again. To just tell them that I don't live here that I don't stay here because, for the past. It was a 45 day thing I had to do with human services, which I think 45 days would have been a September 30 or whatever. But i'm. i'd have to leave my house every night supposedly to eight o'clock every night and i'd have to go stay the night with my sister wake up in the morning. I like six in the morning come back to town to make sure to get my kid up for school she gets I get her up at seven o'clock and then she gets on the bus and like eight o'clock. So it was basically. Just stress more added stress than I needed, so I go stay with my sister through the night come back in the morning, I said, if they come back again just tell me don't stay here. And that'd be the end i'm like okay. that's cool. And she's like if they do having to come back and we don't get your case. You can ask for us, or whatever i'm like okay well hopefully you all will be back cuz I mean guys are nice folks and i'm getting sick senior and dealing with you. And if."
207.0,Provider,you're nice but i'm thinking.
10804.0,Patient,"right and it was like every time they show up i'd be in the shower. And like I thought she was supposed to be here till 1230 is not even 1230 it trying to get my shower in. But yeah they said they wouldn't be back and when she came it'd be a Children services lady, and then a peer support. chick that is through our recovery place we got in town and I I knew her from going to group with her back in a day and stuff. But I never knew she became a peer support specialist or whatever, but that's what they're pushing me to do is to. Get back. Either into college or or sign up and take the classes to be peer support person or whatever. But I don't know what the heck I want to do, I can't make a decision to say my damn life Sometimes I feel like i'm burnout with all the recovery so and then. Sometimes i'm like well i'm I have to do with it for myself for the rest of my life, so I hope somebody else in the process, because I get told that a lot that i'm a good person to talk to you I get good advice I don't. Like. My neighbor always has to come. talk to me because he says that. i'm good to talk to you i'm the only one that understands him and that. I don't know we click I understand and i'm like well. i'm good at telling other people, you know what they what they could do, or whatever. It is sometimes I need to take my own damn about."
207.0,Provider,hmm. So what about the lovely such children.
10804.0,Patient,"They are. They had. Okay, the steps, children, the one that is raining jerry's house crosstown. For boyfriend. They had his I think she's a nice or cousin. She they let her and her little boyfriend move in and then they found out that her little boyfriend was a sex offender or some something like that, and they served her an eviction notice three day eviction notice and she was bullying them and had them scared and basically. kicked them out of their own damn house, because they didn't want to stay there with the girl, and the girl made sure she stayed there two or three days was up but uh. She called children services on them."
207.0,Provider,"Oh, I."
10804.0,Patient,Thought well hell Karma is it a bit. Karma is a bitch. And during the whole time. i'm like this is bullshit I shouldn't have to deal with Jim services or like katie should have to deal with them to I should I shouldn't have to be the only one and.
207.0,Provider,"Also, so who. Are you."
10804.0,Patient,"No, no, no, no, I mean I wanted to but i'm like no I believe in Karma she'll get her Karma for what she did and sure enough she did, but it was her boyfriend's Nice or cousin they let stay with them. And she ended up calling children services on sent her a text message and said in joy your children, why you can because children services will be there soon, and then a couple hours joking services was at her door. And I guess the girl had a video of. them driving in the car. And that girl had alcohol. She was under age. and It didn't show the person driving, which would have been katie my. Baby daddies oldest daughter, and then her son's in the backseat showed a picture of him going to hold on tight that they were hill hopping and I guess she gave that video to children services. But I guess they couldn't prove it was katie driving or not, or whatever, and if she was drinking and then gave them drug test. And the boyfriend he failed for marijuana. But get this. Go for marijuana and he said he used it for medical purposes or whatever, but he also does the dabs or whatever the hell, that is as it's like a resin or thc I don't know how it works. i'm old school right you been in the game in a long time. I don't know about these new drugs easy. He told him that he was going to fail for marijuana so what he did was a toy, he told me to use it for medical purposes so his boss gave him the money and he went and got his marriage marijuana card or whatever. mm hmm services was okay with that. And i'm like Okay, and then katie told them that she was going to for help. She did see she said that she's going to fail for methamphetamines because she takes a camera if it's adderall or Ritalin and i'm just like you told him, he was going to fail for methamphetamines and she's like yeah I should it's not methamphetamines it would be amphetamines. I said method methamphetamines would be like crystal meth man made stuff."
207.0,Provider,and
10804.0,Patient,"I said you better hope he wasn't doing that I said because they could tell the difference. There, because they send that mouth swab off and they break it down, maybe tell you how much nano grams and stuff is in your system or whatever, and I was like they could tell the difference between methamphetamines and amphetamines. And then Jerry son, which will be katie's brother he wasn't there, he was at work. And Jerry rain over there, real quick when children services showed up over there and let him walk through the House and stuff they asked big going Jackson jackson's room, which is his son katie's brother and. They told them no you don't need to go in there he's not here not I don't know, but I wish, he would have been there and got a drug test because they liked him they smoke pot with him and he's only 17. But I think. Jerry went back and told them that I was a pissed off that ad deal with children, services and that I was going to turn them in for their pot smoking and forgetting Jackson high and he's a minor and finding alcohol and shit I think Jerry went back and told him that, because. Now Jackson says that he doesn't smoke pot anymore, and he has smoke pot and over three weeks or more so. Good his way I did scaring and they're not doing drugs. But I never did in the consumer services on them, I might have said it, but it didn't do it because i'm like if I do it now i'm going to give some Karma and I want that they'll get their own Karma and Sure enough, they did. I was like well. how's it feel now you know don't feel very good being scared afraid someone's gonna take your kid away. All over. stupid shit."
207.0,Provider,we're all we're being found by someone.
10804.0,Patient,"Well, I might not have legal custody of her, but what do they call it, I have physical because she's lived with me, since she was three years old, about three going on four because she started preschool. It was just easier to have her at my house then over there at his house. and get her off the bus and stuff it was just easy to do it here. And then, when he would get off work or whatever we go over to his house. And then I just got boring because he comes in for more tired and soon as he sat down he falls asleep so. We quit doing that just stayed at home and then he would come over here, and then it wasn't till. i'm. November of last year that. He just started staying. No he hasn't stayed with us all that time. till November. And I guess that's when we decided we would try a relationship which actually I feel like it's a. He. feels like he can't get nobody or can't get who he wanted. So i'm just going to settle with alyssa because list is always there and. alyssa helps me out more than anybody has so i'm just going to stick with alyssa. What do you think, and I think I said we'll do because i'm just like. He would, if I tried to have another boyfriend. I feel like he would. not let me see my kid or something. You know i'm saying. Like we and children services had said for told him to be a. hyper vigilant and then, if he feels like or suspect that i'm on drugs or hanging out with people that do drugs or anything of the sort, not to let a TV around me and not let me take kiwi by myself. And he's like Okay, I understand that. And then. i'm just like it if I was on drugs Jerry would know. I mean, he might be an older guy but he ain't stupid. Because I miss around him when I was on froze hi good in my full blown addiction doing heroin doing math doing whatever the hell I get my hands on. And and. that's why I tell them all the time i'm like Jerry when you're on drugs when you're off drugs and, like the two different people and, like the person I was when I was on drugs ain't the person I am now like. totally different. I said this shit did I did, then I wouldn't do server I wouldn't do it all sober or in my right mind. Because he likes it. Every now and then accuse me of. messing around with somebody else or whatever. and Of course, he was drinking at time usually, when it comes out as when he's drinking and. he'd be accusing me of sleeping with these ugly people ain't got no teeth fucking dirty but. Oh, my God couldn't you accuse me and sleeping with some hot guy at least. ugly fools. Like is that would make me think that little me that I can only get these."
207.0,Provider,Little all you can get what's on my own. that's all you can get.
10804.0,Patient,i'm like I wouldn't touch them people. When your body. If I had your body parts I wouldn't touch them. I went done with your winner.
207.0,Provider,"Oh, so, but at least at least like you said, the exciting part is knowing that. The exciting part is knowing that you are. Such services close and you were able to. Prove basically everything that you've been doing."
10804.0,Patient,"Right. So, and they told me they just wanted me to continue doing like suboxone thing and seeing the drug counselor and then. I got into our mental health out here. hit and then she tells me that they don't have a doctor right now i'm like okay. Well that's my main purpose coming out here lady to try to get on some mental health medicine, I mean. Dr Cruz, or whatever he'll. gives me my zoloft. When I was trying to get on. Back on the rest of my medicine like I had taken so long and I dropped xen. and Well, they gave me a rotten but they said. It was for two things for my diet better drop the thing going on and then also they said it would help my nerves, and my anxiety. which I can tell difference from not having it. Like my hands and on right now I got it my big toe my second time or no, so I need to get back into refined me a regular doctor to get into so I can get. My diabetic medicine and all that back and hope that they will still prescribe me back because I guess it's turned into a narcotic now or on the list or whatever the rotten get a bit new and whatever you want to call it. I mean I knew i've heard of people. lyrica. So i'm like I don't I don't want that. Like they said it would speed them up or something like I don't have I don't need none of that."
207.0,Provider,i'm looking at here. So you got a month worth of medication.
10804.0,Patient,"yeah last month, he gave me a month refill and then I guess. This month is a week one too, because he said he was going on vacation or something. So I mean I can't pick it up till tomorrow or the next day anyway. But I think he sent them in last week. Any of that in some stool softener."
207.0,Provider,Okay okay. i'm always looking at your track.
10804.0,Patient,"And then, when I made my appointments with you, or whatever. They said, it will be soon in a drug test so i'm waiting for that tip. it's about that time, I think, last month, it was on the 20. Last month I got the directors on August 20. And then, with the mental health thing you have to have. Three visits. Before. You can be letting to see the doctor or whatever. And then said that the doctor that they do have. won't see or won't prescribe to. Somebody who's there for both mental health and drugs. Well i'm like. Well, I don't need to be seeing for drug counseling here because I do it with my zoom or whatever, so, then, can we just do it as mental health and then I would be able to see the doctor. And then the our side colleges or psychiatry guy in town, you can get in you can get an appointment that guy unless you have a referral from a doctor. And I wonder, sometimes it is suboxone just messes with me. Like me, literally with like my sleep thing like a. And they said I had bipolar because I told him that I could. Sometimes there's periods, where I want to sleep when I could sleep, the whole weekend away. My first week my kids not here. And then there's times, where like i'm. I could stay awake. And i'd be real talkative and and stuff like that now my sometimes I wonder if the suboxone."
207.0,Provider,"I would, what I would recommend is that you. Know for next Wednesday, you have any individual."
10804.0,Patient,Our next one is on. Point on.
207.0,Provider,"No, no i'm talking about your next your next."
10804.0,Patient,With the new health.
207.0,Provider,With with Isaiah to have you ever met with either.
10804.0,Patient,"No, I have to, I have to do a. schedule, one on one time i've never had one yet."
207.0,Provider,"I would recommend you do that, and to talk to him. about that because he's not going to be here this Thursday Thursday so i'm."
10804.0,Patient,"Going on vacation or something. And then I also total mental health that I wanted to get checked for add. I feel like. I don't know if you people miss it runs in the family, I know that. my sister was just diagnosed with it, she said to fail the day he's like I failed every question on the desk. and I know because I remember in school, it was always hard for me to pay attention. I gotta be have my book out hey i'm going to take notes and we'll pay attention and listen to what they say and then i'm out in left field thing about something totally different and then, of course, they call your name alyssa and what do you think. I don't know. Can you repeat the question. Because i'm out here, thinking about something totally different. And like. Like just cleaning around the House i'll start the dishes. I don't finish them now i'll be all starting something else. laundry or something. don't even got it finished knowing I got it full of water by eating up the imposing there Oh, and then goes to sweeping the floors something like I don't. finish them through. And then, sometimes it just gives me anxiety because. i'm just like. Oh, I got all this shit to do and I don't have enough time. or help like hey Joe help me. With Jerry did help today, you did the dishes. I was like well thanks any clean the toilet Thank you. When she had diarrhea anyway, so I told him, he was going to toilet."
207.0,Provider,wow. Okay yeah I do see your appointment appointment at one can famous down. So.
10804.0,Patient,"Just thought about well why don't I just drive the 3045 minutes to Washington courthouse where my doctor the doctor that I used to have that would come down here. She would come down on Mondays to our health source here and down, but she she quit doing that, but she's got her own office and worse, of course. i'm like why don't I just drive that 3045 minutes up there, and do, that that way I got a doctor dollar I knows me that already knows. Those myself. Instead of getting a doctor that don't know me and with this all you have to have so many business before you can see a doctor type thing. But she was only a nurse practitioner or whatever."
207.0,Provider,"yeah I mean, I think you should have continued to think confidence and just doing diligently what you need to do and saying on the upside of things and. You know, things always work out in it, and I think, just like chosen service into evidence of that that even though you don't have legal custody, but still them putting you through all of that, so you were able to maintain your. You know your daughter in your home and it needs him to have continue having customers. off her a nice living in this part of her life and not disrupting so and that's what it comes down to. It comes down to us doing our own due diligence, even though we don't know we may not necessarily agree with a person tactic in their way about going. I mean, their way of going about things, and just have a few things you may not necessarily agree with it, but you know, at the end, in the end, if we do what we're what's required of us, then we come out on the upside you know I mean. I think that's just ultimately what the what what happened for. You, and so you know at least you could come out knowing like you said you know and i'm sure how good does that feel for you to saying. To put yourself in the category i'm old school whatever new drug they got out here, I don't know because i've been out of the game for so long. Sorry us to say that sentence is I think it's kudos to you because, like you said yes, I can I can honestly say. That, I was in the game, and this is how I went about it but nowadays, whatever they got going on, I haven't kept up with it, and I have no real knowledge of it and I don't know. In comparison to so being intervention that life and having to figure out how to get around it and and knowing that here it is charge charge for their services is coming to Christ in your life and in your business and and but then being in that place of saying. i'm not nervous about anything i'm not doing anything on doing everything that is right so there's nothing, I have to hide, because you think about. A life like that it's a very exhausting life in the sense that I have to figure out how do I do this, how are high bit Hawaii. it's a very it's very mentally emotionally and physically exhausting in comparison to saying welcome in. have a seat, you want to drink us while we're at it let's talk, because I haven't no I have nothing to hide from you, you know you know you can say hey if you find something you both of us are going to be surprised together. we're going to have shocked together, because if you find something on me or something shows up for me now let's have a conversation about what you got maybe something wrong with your test, maybe something wrong with whatever you know. I know where I am."
10804.0,Patient,"Well, actually, that test would come back saying that I didn't have anything in my system i'm like full suboxone should be in there i'll talk about in there, you know. I think they're cheap passes. were just looking for one certain thing, like the allegation was that they heard, I was on heroin and meth, so I think that that they just tested for heroin and meth they didn't run a full panel drug test. But they knew that. I was prescribed to suboxone and I would show her my pill bottle every week or whatever and but I never. While I never seen them, but she just would tell me that my drug my drug test came back good I was clean for everything or whatever and i'm just never understood by the."
207.0,Provider,"suboxone because, like you said it's your drug test, what is it looking for if i'm not if i'm looking for cocaine and all the heroin and all the public so then your course it's going to be good, but I have to, I have to I would have to be looking for for something else."
10804.0,Patient,"Right, so I figured it probably cost the city or whatever, more money to run a full panel drug test and just to look for one or two things."
207.0,Provider,"One thing to remember keep in mind if you're if you're if you're you know if you're on suboxone I mean it is you know it, are they. Are they going to be concerned about boxing as much as they'll be concerned about everything else."
10804.0,Patient,"Oh no they didn't have fun with me being on suboxone. Actually, to see the children services lady is a recovering addict and then the peer support chick is a recovering addict to so they believe in, they said they believed in him at. streaming or whatever."
207.0,Provider,"mm hmm. yeah so it comes down to the individual and who wants to get all excited and you know their their. Their understanding and education, like you said, have a program and you know, but again it's all about what i'm looking for now is that is that you are giving birth and. You know, are honest boxing is showing up and now they're having to treat or whatever and it's depending on what they want to do, then they'll say hey well, I mean I am being followed by a doctor because it's been prescribed I am going into and you could prove all of that. Then it will be different."
10804.0,Patient,"units and they never heard about. The Internet thing before, though. about doing the. Being able to get suboxone through the Internet or whatever."
207.0,Provider,And how you set it up. it's called Brown.
10804.0,Patient,"Delivery you're getting confused with bright view because here in in another town like a half hour away from us, they have a suboxone. And place and it's called bright Bu. And I always tell everybody i'm like it's. Not bright view and bright heart."
207.0,Provider,"And it's an online it's an online program just like how you go to um what is it called a booth and all these other it's all anonymous groups online, but it's all in the delivery yeah I got my my suboxone online the oh so if we like Amazon on here. that's that's what accepted. Right, we are here like Amazon you do just like."
10804.0,Patient,I see Dr we do.
207.0,Provider,So hold up so we. can go. So we just we could just pick which doctor and with therapists on Amazon now. let's put that in your car. That is all about delivery now.
10804.0,Patient,On the black when.
207.0,Provider,Exactly having people thinking we get you out here. to lift route.
10804.0,Patient,We know we're getting her drugs and.
207.0,Provider,it's a call from mit@amazon.com no.
10804.0,Patient,"No, it was on certain do that."
207.0,Provider,"Yes, they listen listen, what does that guy's name, whatever his name bazell is he I have explore other things now listen it's all in the delivery, but like you said. You know you will have people that are a little bit more supportive because you know they have their own program that they're going through and so they're definitely a little bit more supportive in comparison to. Someone who doesn't necessarily know but Tele health is just something that it's you know it's been around for a while it just became a lot more popular. And a lot more, you know definitely more accepted because of Coleman yeah and so. You know a lot more people are are saying Okay, you know it's kind of like you know you're it's like a methadone program is you know you have your methadone clinics and different things like that so. You know i'm sure if you say hey you know it's the nsp program and it's you know you could physically go there they'll they probably won't turn up their nose at it, as you know, and I think a lot because it's attached to it being online. And so people turn up their nose at it, but again once it's a little bit more politically or you know accepted or you know and it's it's been around for a while and Brett has been around for many years."
10804.0,Patient,"yeah I didn't know that I thought they were new and stuff and then I heard that they've been around for a while, like oh darn I didn't know that. You think does it go, but as."
207.0,Provider,"they've been around for a while it's just that, in terms of being in as many states have met as they have been in it that is so, you know it's unique it's one of its kind. And so, when you have something that's one of the time you'll again people will you have nothing really to compare it against. Because you remember reviews is that compared against all these different things, so when you don't have really much to compare it again. You tend to to be a little bit skeptical about it. Because you don't have anybody else or anything to say Oh well, let's just say what you said, right here, right, you have an online component, and this is how their program run in comparison to this. One this permanent one off it's kind of a lot of people are not aware of it they'll change who. they'll tend to be they'll have their thoughts or their biases and in even though you have other point, you know and again it's all about where you are in your recovery as well, because if you if you are. A place in your recovery where you're you're still kind of in that free content like to I really want to do, I do, I really want you to do. And in if you are if you're still in that pre contemplation chasing you say hey, but you can get your prescription. And so they're all about the hertz friction but they're not completely don't they don't want to host the therapy they don't want to do the drug screens they don't want to do everything that that comes with. The total healing process, the total transformation process if a person is not completely there. And then they write a bad review, because then they're like Oh, this is more than I expected because I didn't know I had to do this and i'm not because there's just something there, whereas another person who has gone through the pre contemplation contemplation and now they're in that. Now you're in that, like you, you're in that maintenance phase. Where you're just kind of like hey listen i'm going to not just do the groups i'm going to do my individuals i'm going to do my drug screens i'm going to meet with my doctor once a month, if I have to. And so you're you're you're you're working your complete program your review is going to look different because you have bought into your own recovery. you're not so much mind into a program as much as your mind into your personal recovery. Because that's what makes the difference it's not the program we just provide the tools, but you have to be you have to buy into your own recovery and saying, I am going to do what is necessary for me to maintain my recovery that's how a program works for you."
10804.0,Patient,yeah i'm actually either. Get gave a couple people. bright heart information and and they've gotten into the program to.
207.0,Provider,"And, but and it's again it comes down to and you don't even if you refer like you know i'm a firm believer hey i'll refer this to you, but it can only work if you allow. It from the beginning it's going to feel like this is punitive like I gotta go I gotta jump through all these hoops and I think that's with anything that's with anything it's when you're when you first start recovery you're you're going to say. you're going to say hey you know I feel this way and I feel that way, but in the end. It really is if I if I work my program the way i'm supposed to if i'm serious about my own recovery, not so much my program but if i'm curious about my recovery then hey. You will ultimately make it work for you, because then it's not so much about the the suboxone the suboxone is only one piece of it, the cycle parent and the psychotherapy. The bigger piece of it and, like, I always tell people i'm not trying to sell because you've got to meet with me there's a whole lot of therapists in this program. But it's the cycle therapy, that is the biggest piece of it, because all we're doing is talking to you about your past issues in your current issue. How does your past affect your your original decision, but more so, how are you continuing to deal and cope with it, how, when you meet with your when when you're faced with. Your daily challenges in your daily structure, instead of naturally running towards what you've done, which is freeze it or numb it. that's what you've done in the past, how are you dealing with it today, is it really is the suboxone that nothing is helping you cope with your problems, no. it's your ability to face them and work through them that's that's what's really working at at because truth be told you, but listen if you I know you'll be held in peace if you find out for the last year you've been taken four to 40 pills."
10804.0,Patient,Right.
207.0,Provider,you'll be home. office depot and you and Jeff but a bunch of what fields. And then you ended up but it work you see how powerful the mind is. yeah yeah.
10804.0,Patient,"Actually I I did teach CPS something that I got for me. And they say that they never they never done it that way, and that they were going to use it and it was when back when we was talking about idols. um they never heard heard it put that way or or whatever, and how idol can be. A good thing or a bad thing, or whatever. And that it could be, you know your children your relationship or whatever, not just somebody you idol not like in."
207.0,Provider,person physical item.
10804.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,intentional destruction of our life circumstances yeah and situation and that's what we idolize him so you.
10804.0,Patient,want to look at from.
207.0,Provider,"A young guy know. Add it's just you look at look at you know even the you know what you got listed on listen when we was in school. You think I was paying attention to have some things and people said no, because I didn't want to be here in the first place."
10804.0,Patient,Right.
207.0,Provider,what's interesting i'm all about it.
10804.0,Patient,Right. I take my notes. i'm almost ready for a new notebook because it's cool so every time we have group I always write something down.
207.0,Provider,"tell you what's up listen I paid attention to nothing new I listen, I saw the school. He was like PAC man in school. yeah that's what I did. I just."
10804.0,Patient,got enough that I passed on.
207.0,Provider,"When you're in high school and they say you gotta do is it. will have to repeat the class no all right, we could be selling what why we why we. started paying attention when I got into what I love now you got me you you this, this is legitimate relationship, because I liked what we thought."
10804.0,Patient,There was no college that I got a's and and it was because I was. Taking psychology classes and stuff and I like psychology so.
207.0,Provider,I bet you go.
10804.0,Patient,ahead and read the book.
207.0,Provider,"There you go and when you read it you're like for real oh my God and CC listen listen, the timing you so you know, the end of the day. it's just like it's all about how you you you apply yourself that's really what it comes down to you know that the tools are being provided, but the tool means nothing to you. If you're not ready to use them if you're not ready to apply it to what you need to and that's what it comes down to."
10804.0,Patient,"Like Jerry had said something about he don't like that I take this box and he thinks that I don't even need it, or whatever, and I said. Member when you got into all that trouble back in December, because you've been up at the bar drinking all day you got your first unemployment check basically blew it all at the bar and then you ended up over at the motorcycle gang place and. got drunk with them, or something and they might have slipped you something or gave you something, because you ended up. leaving out of there, and you hit a couple cars and then. You had been staying at my house, but for some reason you went to your House and you hit your car in the backyard and then the COPs show up and then. They thought you were dying, so they called an ambulance and then you ended up being careful I did all the way up to Columbus and they really thought you were going to die and i'm all they come back with say that he had alcohol poisoning. And i'm like how the heck did he get alcohol poisoning when i've seen him drink more than a 30 Pack in a day. But anyway, i'm after that he was talking to one of his friends and. his friend was telling me that. there's medicine that that he could take for being an alcoholic that would keep him from. Not drinking and not wanting to drink or whatever. i'm like yeah and abuse or something like that."
207.0,Provider,yeah and yeah.
10804.0,Patient,"And he was like yeah Well, my friend Todd thinks that I should do something like that sounds like it wouldn't hurt I said that's exactly. I said it's just like like me, taking the suboxone."
207.0,Provider,I said what did he said.
10804.0,Patient,"He keeps me away from the opiates and I know I can't put an op ED in my body, if I do that i'm gonna get sicker than a dog and that ain't no fun and and then he just. He kind of looks at it, different now. But I wish I would try that ain't abuse."
207.0,Provider,"yeah I think I think that's what it was yeah I think his enemies, where I think if you do drink yes. If you have a reaction to it, but again, you know again it's still it comes down to it's all about the mental processing it comes down to. The cycle of faith always comes down to the psychotherapy of it and it's just helping you to understand. That alcohol was just the method that you use or whatever you use to help to numb you from your real issues enhance that's all it is. And so, unless you work through dealing with life and in situations and learning how to cope and that's what it comes down to learning how to cope. it's really what it is because you know, like I said you'll be helping people if you find out, it was they said it was any of us what it really was a placebo a July, but it work, no, we didn't because it was a ship appeal. You want to be met, and then, when I tell you what this bill, then all of a sudden oh i'm going through and no, you know it's only because I made you were."
10804.0,Patient,"Like last week and Jerry I got drunk or whatever and. He was at all all pissy. Because I was in my room talking to my nephew. me my nephew were like same age we went to school together stuff he's not like my nephew through blood, but his his dad married my oldest sister or whatever. But we've always got along and I was just in my room talking about he was talking about having problems with his wife and stuff like that, and I was just you know, being an ear for it for him that I was being there for him to have someone to listen to me talk or whatever and. And I said ain't nobody want to talk about their personal stuff with a fucking room full of people was like. God i'm like he's family. But Jerry was getting all mad he was drunk. And mad because they know dinner was cooking and all this other stuff and. He was like when I was younger my mom always made sure she had dinner on the table, or my mom didn't make dinner than my sisters did. I said yeah you also grew up with a silver spoon in your damn mouth your your family had money. My dad my dad was at work, so it was me my sister and my brother, we think for ourselves if we had to make her room so something to eat, then we did. We never really had it set we never had a breakfast lunch and dinner, you know and sometimes if dad was home from work or whatever. cook dinner and sit down and eat it as a family but and then it wasn't till like my sister was older, because my sister Jenny the want to live here with us she's 10 years older than me so it probably wasn't till I was in like. Maybe like fourth, fifth grade and then middle school or whatever that she would she would make dinner every night, you know she'd write out the grocery list and her dad go to the store and whatever, but it was like I always told people that I was like Matilda growing up. And then I had to. Take care of myself pretty much. Because my dad was gone at work. My mom was she lived in town, but. Julie came around when it was convenient for her and she she worked and she also had another kid. So, like we fend for ourselves if we was hungry, we went to the damn fridge rater and we got ourselves so me, you know, and he was like vision, because there are no dinner was cooked cooked or whatever, and I straight up said, Mr your mother no not Am I your wife hell no i'm not."
207.0,Provider,Only is he. What is.
10804.0,Patient,"He afraid you're going to eat, something that you're not supposed to i'm like. eat, whatever the hell, you want."
207.0,Provider,"But, but even if you compare yourself to Matilda and you remember the show on Monday Matilda That was their abuse. And it's it's funny um you know once if you can just you can look at that and you think about. And then that's what I said it's more so the cycle therapy, that is really the bigger part of any treatment that you're hitting because, if I could compare myself growing up to Matilda. And even if it it mimics almost with let's just use the narrative then it mimics matilda's life to a TEE and how bad that is you think about the psychological impact it has on the overtime. And how you then operate your operating through that life because yes Matilda was fending for herself because they're her parents with some other stuff and so you're fending for yourself."
10804.0,Patient,But I did grow up quick.
207.0,Provider,"You have so you never really had a chocolate, so now, when you get older you revert to I want to be a child, but then you're thinking, I had to grow up quick so with growing up quick. You see other kids being kids and you want to be that, but you know your realities I can't be that you think about the psychological impact that it has. And so you know let's just say, if you had had a child and a very, very young age, and someone was like oh look at alyssa she thinks she grown because that's how she's growing up. For her you're looking at her in a child's body, and you know she's a she's a legitimately a child. or for her she's not thinking like a child, for her she's an adult because that's just how she has been forth, but nobody sophisticated but, again, you think about that psychological impact my reality is physically. And it is that I am a child, I am a certain way, but the way i'm being raised i'm being raised as an adult twice think of it as an adult i'm operating as an adult because i'm forced that way. But then you haven't used to emotionally and mentally you're still having to deal with. The the naysayers and everything, so you think about the psychological impact and so hey eventually so when somebody says, I have no feelings. No, you still have feelings because you're operating out of those emotions you're operating out of that hurt because it's no time for you to be happier to be glad you're operating out of. resentment you're operating out of the anger you're operating out of that lessons in that feeling of rejection you're operating out of all of those emotions that you think you don't have or you're really truly operating out of all of that. And so, therefore, and so, therefore, you know, for you, it is hey listen, this is my life, and so you take the drugs to numb that reality you take the drugs to know all of that. And, but oftentimes we don't recognize that that's what's really truly going on, and this is how we function, and so this is the reason why so like you said him being an alcoholic you think about if you've ever gotten to the place where he talks about. where he talks about his life growing up, and what that was liking, you know all of the things that he suppressed over the year you'll be like oh whoa buddy. hey."
10804.0,Patient,"Well, from what I know he was just. spoil."
207.0,Provider,But you see you grow up in that hard life and then this is the thing what we.
10804.0,Patient,"mean I was spoiled to I got whatever I wanted. From my dad, I think, because he felt bad because out of guilt, because my mom wasn't there my mom left when I was two or whatever, and I was his baby, so I always got whatever I wanted. And so I think being enabled. A. message what you do you don't necessarily have to be you know have some kind of trauma in your life to be a drug addict. Or, I mean I don't feel like I had much trauma in my life my mom left when I was too, but I don't really remember. I remember being in the car with my dad and we went looking for. I was closer to three, but I was, I was like."
207.0,Provider,"yeah time is not always associated with it's not always trauma that's associated there's also the needs to fit in. yeah so the need, they there's no pressure. There so there's there's so many other things. You know, yes, you may have grown up without a mom or or even if you are filling mom or you know, whatever the situation is if I grew up with a privileged life. hey I grew up because there's a there's a there's a deep sense of loneliness within the privilege life because hey you know what. i'm just you know i'm just using material things to make me happy, but I realized that no matter how much material things and money, I have, I am not happy. I still need that connection, I still need that love, I still need you understand and say they're always everybody has their own story as to what brought them to this role."
10804.0,Patient,"I said Jerry says that he started drinking become an alcoholic. After he he found his dad dad. His dad. Was complaining a heartburn or indigestion and had asked Jerry run up to the store to getting some tums or whatever, and by the time he got back his dad was unresponsive and sisters were given him cpr and everything and he didn't make it."
207.0,Provider,And that's.
10804.0,Patient,that's when Jerry went downhill.
207.0,Provider,"That I have agree, you know the alcohol three."
10804.0,Patient,He was in the army and then quit that. disorderly discharge or something he didn't.
207.0,Provider,Give Honorable Honorable.
10804.0,Patient,"yeah yeah because his dad was in the army and was in it for a long time and and. Yes, and after his dad died need to quit doing that and quit doing a lot of things that him and his dad. used to do together. and turn to alcohol. But he has a he has his spells where he'll drink and then he'll be sober for years and and drink and sober for years or drinks over here and. Last week, when we had gotten to that fight in my nephew was here my my nephew he's been he's done drugs and been to rehab and stuff like that and. he's even. Not just drugs but alcohol to and. hell years ago him and Jerry were drinking together but Tyler said man sounds like he's got like a lot of repressed anger, or something like he just don't he's don't trust you he's always worried about she cheated on him and everything I said well because his ex wife and. His first wife. I guess they cheated owning all time I said in my his last wife, which is my cousin I said she cheated on him like and just planning for stupid. I said he didn't know half of the stuff that she did till after they were split up but uh I said that still affects saying so that's why he worries about getting cheated on because he was. cheated on her hat."
207.0,Provider,"So then, so then i'm dealing with the military i'm dealing with the loss of my dad i'm dealing with intellectually, so why should I am drinking traumatic traumatic trauma trauma. Like you're welcome, and I mean."
10804.0,Patient,"If I got to work on my life and I got a big things about me and so i'm I hate to tell you, but i'm not the only one. You gotta get some stuff figured out to. Which which he did get insurance so he's done he went to the doctor, which is a plus because he's he's a type like never really understood this, but. Like i've seen him take pain pills and stuff before, when he was with my cousin stuff. Or take. All them diet pills. Ad packs and. drink alcohol. But when it comes down to taking like a medication that you need or whatever new would take i'm just like. I do not understand you. My guy I gave him some men's multivitamin 50 plus because there'll be 59 next week and then um I I got into some asked to buy FLEX because he was talking about his knees hurting and stuff and. guarding that. I just go off like what my my dad's always been like herbal medicines and vitamins in and stuff like that and i'm like well since you don't want to take regular medicines and stuff then here's you some vitamins and stuff you need something you're older. you're playing back to back hurting your knees hurt and. All that try these and then. When he did go to the doctor or whatever I guess from the episode he had back in December and they care for the team, and all that I just don't understand why. But every time i've ever left the damn hospital they leave I leave with paperwork stating you know why I was seeing and what my problems was and everything else well they back then. They had. done a bunch of stuff to a man and found that he had some spots on a small intestine. So when he seen the doctor yesterday and the doctor was going through his file or whatever they told him about that, so he has to go get something done and forget what it's called are the cat scan, this is what it was. To get that done and i'm like well we're just gonna keep it positive in cancer it ain't nothing like that now you can't get cancer is just a little awesome from you drink a bit that's all that's all oh i'm Al myself, it is anyway. Because. i've always a. Like Dreading the day that I got to tell my kid that are dads are hearing them or something you know because he's older. he's an older fella, even though we don't act like it. But um yeah like I said he'll be 59 on. Monday So. But i'm glad that he got the insurance and he went to the doctor. That is a plus."
207.0,Provider,"that's good that's good, and I think you know the way you live, your life in the way you did new things and. you're just here consistency with just your own treatments and your own intervention. All you have to do just be consistent, he will he will follow truth, he will follow behind and that's going through just see that example and just encourage and motivate them to say hey it's not just about taking the enemies or anything like that it is really. Facing you're."
10804.0,Patient,"Talking about with my nephew or whatever my nephew was saying, sounds like he's got a lot of repressed anger and he's always worried about achievement. and He knew Jerry was mad or whatever it and he asked Jerry he's like a year you won't go today meeting injuries like when right now i'm like well not right now, because it's almost 11 o'clock at night and and then juries like yeah i'd be proud to take you in there and i'm just like. jury they probably don't even remember who the heck you are it's been years like. 30 years that you've ever been have been there, but um. They never ended up going. But Jerry and drink sense, because my dad even had to tell him. hey shut the Fuck up i'm sick of hearing it, you know she's not cheating on you it's the damn beer talking. And I was like oh when dad says something you know should super serious. know. After that yea. yea dried drinking or anything like that yeah even said about it. Because I just want to be like how my dad yelled at you, but you know I keep that to myself."
207.0,Provider,You know.
10804.0,Patient,"When dad when dad says something you know she's serious. In which that should have said was do it. You know you don't need to be stressed out he's 82 years old and so. We don't need to be fighting and arguing answers in here now in the kid out. But when people are drunk. can't do nothing. it's like Okay, I understand now just shut up let's quit arguing everything's cool everything's fine we've got some code he's going on the stove here's the bread here's the coney sauce hot dogs in there's your dinner."

10804.0,Patient,"yeah okay. Because I figured maybe I was getting close. cuz I think I started this in April, and that was another thing I was like Why am I am I ever going to get off weekly. and go to bi weekly for the meds or whatever, and then, then I get a monthly refill and then i'm like oh."
