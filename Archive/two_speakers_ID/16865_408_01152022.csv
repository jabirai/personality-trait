16865.0,Patient,"No, no idea stress."
408.0,Provider,But.
16865.0,Patient,"I apologize about last week, where we had this snowstorm. Our Internet is terrible. And now we're expecting another store."
408.0,Provider,"Oh, my goodness, well, I understand, and you are in a state that gets lots and lots of snow so. Yes, you know that's to be at seasonal that is seasonally appropriate. yeah alright, well, we are working on. A problem so they're. The protocol, with a focus on your selected goal, which is working on organizational solutions, as well as adaptation of your ADHD treatment for your new job. yeah all right so let's start with you updating me on what you've observed, so far, because you did recently start a new job and you were going to try out some timing and food issues with hd treatment so update me on the results of that."
16865.0,Patient,"Okay, so far, actually. I did notice that I tried to take my medicine later like not exactly like seven I tried to take it probably around you know closer to 830. near the nine o'clock area, so I don't have to you know be all frazzled because I had to do a lot of paperwork, you know just a new hire paperwork and all that, so I took care of that and I have my own office where i'm the only person in the office. And like I have."
408.0,Provider,Is a very large that may be helpful right.
16865.0,Patient,"It is, it is because I noticed previously when I was working, I had a lot of aggravation coming in, out of the office you know. I shared the office with everybody, basically, he was the childcare workers office and the social workers office so. I had a lot of people coming and going and plus the counselor usually at office to at that time, so now it's just me. And I feel like I can get more you know accomplished, and so the last lately, I really haven't done much of anything other than the paperwork every two weeks, we have a zoom meeting for our program so I did that yesterday that was my first meeting and the next one is on the 28th but."
408.0,Provider,What did you observe about your ADHD symptoms during the zoom meeting.
16865.0,Patient,"I noticed that I actually I was actually able to stay still instead of just fidgeting with different things, and you know, having a to get up and move around our stationery I actually sat there, I mean, I was able to you know take notes and also you know. Actually, the CEO she was like you know very glad to see to make it with us, I hadn't seen her Since you know the shelter and i'm very glad to have her, and I know she'll you know breed be very you know a great benefit to our Program. because all that was it really was and that made my day because my supervisor she's please. She runs the shelter down the street from me and that's like where they have kids actually emergency shelter and those that's the shelter for special needs and they have a lot of different behaviors so she's driving. You know and they're busy over there and so i'm glad that you know she pretty much trust me to be able to navigate and do things on my own and next week, I have to actually our program the regional directors coming down for me to go and meet I only have three clients right now. So i'm getting ready to go out and one of my. Out of three tumor siblings so i'm going with her, she said, if the weather permits to Monday or Tuesday. To actually go out with her and meet the clients that I have, and you know work with them on you know getting to know them and just their history and everything, so I was able to do that, but I need you're frustrated because I locked myself out of. This program, we have to use colada care, but I ended up being given the wrong temporary password so I. miss it and he sent me a new password you know, to bring and I got in and took care of it yesterday but, like, I have a lot of time on my hands at the moment because i'm not doing a lot, right now, I mean not organized different than the office, I mean they live some dishes in there."
408.0,Provider,"I think there's some online training, you can do, while you. just get that out of the way."
16865.0,Patient,"She sent me a lot of things from the like ch like see us that I can get. A magistrate she sent me and this I think is very good, right here that, when she said that I thought that was going to be very, very helpful, it was um. See which one it is. It is. The one is going to be. Here is. fuzzy when she did send me the KC life skills information. See the fourth and she sent me. This yesterday, like I have like. The Secretary of State, but you know the administrative laws and. let's see just like the independent living pilot I have all the whole book the contents for that, then I have she sent me a lot of different things that I use, you know, then of course the KC life skills assessment i'm used to doing though so that's not an issue. But she sent me, it was a webinar on webinar on, let me see is about. I think, being a caregiver like providing care for in very stressful situations so she sent that to me yesterday also so let me see what it is, I have a right here is a. Patient here, it is right here. it's i'm. Freezing see us for for social workers and it's going to be, you know about taking care of people with special needs and just trying to keep your own mental health. You know, keeping your mental health. is basically, as you can and to remember to always take care of yourself and all that good stuff. So she sent me."
408.0,Provider,"These are these online or. Material there online. Everything you do okay with that right. Yes, yes."
16865.0,Patient,"Yes, everything was online our meetings that we have every week. And then she sent me like I said that pilot program which I have to read over that a lot of that. And, just like I said, the rules and stuff like that, for the program itself from is the final value of adoption and legal. legislative rules authoress because we're still working with kids who are in adoption and they're actually agent out of the system. And you know they saw the fca team, and some of them will be in modified program the other ones who don't choose to go, you know further their education. we're helping them with jobs, you know job interviews and just how to look for jobs and just basically the skills don't leave your scales pretty much."
408.0,Provider,"Well, and you probably will need to help them apply for. apply disability. And they have an income. A disability income. Is that manage that health insurance that comes. with it."
16865.0,Patient,"All of it yeah we're going to be responsible for helping them with all those and then. I noticed, they were discussing yesterday that somebody needed a pay because we're not going to be there, pays those who do have. So. yeah so they were trying to find an outside party who just specializes in doing that."
408.0,Provider,So a lot of those have to be court appointed.
16865.0,Patient,"Yes, exactly, and so they they the is not in my area think getting is is."
408.0,Provider,"That is a kettle of fish, it is it isn't because you know you have to go through the whole court system and get some money, so you know. To be appointed to take care of their you know their pay their money monthly and take care of their bills and everything, and then they have a couple of places this. Is such an issue. For the client yeah."
16865.0,Patient,"Thank you, and I think that the whole trust issue was brought up and why we are not going to be there, pays now. Because I think as a mom and gail you Kelly up there were you know morgantown I think that's where the kids decided that they didn't want us to be in their pain so. They decided to. They said they're taking care of that on my answer I think my part will be pretty good, because the girls that I have they are able to work because. The one of the girls is going next week for an interview at one of the local hospitals and the dietitian department so she's able to work and so as our sister."
408.0,Provider,"Well then, the other issue I don't know if you've confronted this yet, but you may need to become familiar with the State Department of vocational rehabilitation."
16865.0,Patient,"Right, the vocational rehabilitation."
408.0,Provider,"boarded and for specifically whether those local county offices offer an actual supported employment protocol. for persons with disabilities included, like the title 90s title 19 now. No support it well yeah both rehab is. Some of them are follow the gold standard supported employment treatment protocol, which is called individualized placement and support. I P s sometimes it's called IP SEC individual placement and support for employment, so it's ips or IP SEC in the va all of all of their. They don't call it book book rehab necessarily the call it something else. compensated work program or something like that. Okay, in this aws I think it's called in the va but they all follow that call it is an actual treatment protocol, but it's designed for people with disabilities, including severe and persistent mental illness. Including substance use disorders that's been extremely successful and getting people with disabilities successfully employed. workshop now. On the economy."
16865.0,Patient,"i'm sorry mentioned yesterday that when I was taking my notes, they mentioned yesterday that we're not going to provide substance abuse treatment services, you know that we're going to have to refer them out for services, and I think."
408.0,Provider,"This is not a strictly speaking and substance use disorder treatment. Right, it can be imported into poignant moment, they have autism, a type of intellectual delays, they see even if you have a client to. Does suffer from a substance use disorder and you're referring them for treatment for that. They can still go to vote we have that has this supported employment and they can still benefit from that and. provide them with job coach. Okay okay nate. Right to coordinate with their employment supervisor."
16865.0,Patient,mm hmm.
408.0,Provider,get their accommodations in place.
16865.0,Patient,"I think that's what they were mentioning yesterday about one area they have some people it's not our. agency, I think it's like nicko or somebody else they have they have employees with their college life coaches now to help their clients. That are in like a similar program see and I think the program is basically where they just started this and they're really kind of flying by the seat of their pants and they don't really you know know which avenues to particularly take."
408.0,Provider,Because because there's a publisher manual lies. Support employment protocol for that.
16865.0,Patient,"Right so i'm thinking Okay, they live, all the way over."
408.0,Provider,On the website.
16865.0,Patient,"Right, and this is kind of like okay so. they'll delegate certain tasks for every you know certain people to do, I think, like the higher ups they'll take care of that aspect Indian whatever trickles down for us to have to do. The will end up taking care of those issues because they were just discussing yesterday. How the CEO asked about another company where they in a meeting and they say how things are working out for them and they said that. You know publicly the person from a different company was indicating oh everything's great, but then behind closed doors, they were talking about all the glitches that they're having and you know trouble having support for various things. Right so. that's to be expected, you know. Of course I knew."
408.0,Provider,These these are complicated situations and the other thing with aging out. Foster kids is that they sometimes have untreated ptsd.
16865.0,Patient,mm hmm.
408.0,Provider,"Absolutely, or it may have been treated early on. But it's not fully in remission. Right, and so you have to watch out. For those kids, particularly because well, for example, we find in the literature, the scientific evidence. Foster kids who aged out have a fairly high rate of enlistment in the military."
16865.0,Patient,mm hmm.
408.0,Provider,"kind of makes sense. Yes, it, you know, unless they have a you know, a serious enough documented disability that would. break them. considered a fit for duty. A lot of times, even if they have ADHD there are medicine for ADHD they'll still be considered fit for duty now. Right and list them well what we find i've tried some of that literature, because I did supported education, I developed support education protocols for returning veterans. Okay, who were returning with ptsd and other."
16865.0,Patient,conditions that.
408.0,Provider,"gave them barriers to to education. To using a GI bill yes. Yes, so. In the course of that research, I found. related research as we followed the oh if oh yes veterans. yeah. and trying to use the GI bill. To get some."
16865.0,Patient,"You know, further college days."
408.0,Provider,"A new career yeah their post military careers. Right and the there were some very disturbing studies that's disturbing to me. That that particularly former foster children. who went into the military who completed military with a general or Honorable discharge. Right medical not you know what i'm saying. yeah this honor so they came back with they if they went back to. Their home communities that they originally were in they were not successful, using their GI bill they had higher rates of homelessness they have higher rates of being arrested."
16865.0,Patient,"Do you think is from not having the natural supports or Indian just the fact that there's no natural supports and then I I personally have seen myself. I feel like a lot of kids who end up in you know in placement weather shelter or even if they go into foster care there's not enough emphasis placed on these kids mental health. And you know, like you said, the product that trauma they've experienced and that just to me is this a huge disservice because. These kids have experienced some very traumatic events in their life and just maybe they wouldn't physical or sexual just the fact that can be uprooted several different times you know placed in this place it did shelter here is, it is."
408.0,Provider,"Very actually knows this now this Robertson. Know hearing has their own research that enlistment wishes. That he has found. That former foster children who were already showing signs of. Adverse childhood events. Yes, who go into the infantry have much higher odds are developing ptsd. yeah, then the general. The general population. which makes sense to a social worker."
16865.0,Patient,Yes.
408.0,Provider,cuz you know what i'm saying.
16865.0,Patient,You see my ability.
408.0,Provider,yeah.
16865.0,Patient,"I mean they're already in the friends will stay in this just said, I just."
408.0,Provider,placed in a high stress combat yes.
16865.0,Patient,Absolutely.
408.0,Provider,"Well, what do you think is gonna happen so."
16865.0,Patient,Thank you.
408.0,Provider,"yeah so just to be aware of that and then there's evidence that well and when those former foster care kids do are able somehow to you know fulfill their obligation their military. If they go back to the same neighborhood they do not do well. is the bottom line. No, so the question is the ones who went back to different neighborhoods."
16865.0,Patient,They went.
408.0,Provider,"To have support systems. Yes, use their GI bill. more successfully had lower right rates. Lower homelessness rates still still higher than the general population of military better than the."
16865.0,Patient,Others others faster walk into.
408.0,Provider,"A high crime neighborhood that they might have come from, I mean."
16865.0,Patient,Right right.
408.0,Provider,All those old negative.
16865.0,Patient,"negative influences in environments and they try to go back home and try to you know, try to. Ship it off in this neighborhood no absolutely not This is like if they were to come back here to this area there's nothing here. You know and it's just sad and like I said, people don't really put enough emphasis on mental health and I just and I hate it and I feel like that might accidentally you say you can't fix everybody, you know you."
408.0,Provider,can't fix it but that's our job so here. Is we are attempting.
16865.0,Patient,To.
408.0,Provider,"Do yes to fix people, it has to be a collaboration collaborative effort."
16865.0,Patient,mm hmm.
408.0,Provider,But it is our responsibility to provide the best evidence. or evidence based support. That gives them. The best options. hmm if they choose to take those.
16865.0,Patient,"Right and that's The thing that you see that it's like when they were about to age out at the shelter I would try to you know. point out different things about going to further your education versus you going back home and getting a job, maybe mcdonald's or at the diner and. you're going to try to make things work out with your mom who ended up you know you were removed from them, but now you're 18 you can go back and you choose to. I mean. Yes, I mean I couldn't save so much, but i'm like just look at you know just just look at where you came from and where you've been able to the things you've been able to achieve by being away from that environment. And it can get so much better if you just chose to they feel like Oh, if I sound like in the States, because they're gonna try and tell me what to do with this, no, no, no, like you said is. Is self determination is read so choose to you know use those resources, but I would always try to, but a lot of times it didn't pan out that way."
408.0,Provider,"But you still have to provide the best information you have and so now i'm just sharing with you that there is now accumulated scientific evidence. Right about foster kids who have aged out and what their pathways are out of foster care when they get to that point and which one's worked out better than others. Okay, so you have that evidence Now you can share, not only with your clients, but with the higher ups."
16865.0,Patient,Right absolutely.
408.0,Provider,"I also sharing this with you, because we know from our title for e. The child welfare, training, research, that social workers who. equipped with evidence based information are less likely to burnout."
16865.0,Patient,burnout yes.
408.0,Provider,So now you've got another inkling that there's this kind of evidence out there that could be useful. job. In your new job.
16865.0,Patient,In my new job absolutely.
408.0,Provider,"And you know, and if you run into one of these situations with a client, you can always do a Google scholar search. Okay, and you put in keywords to Google scholar like supported employment or ips all caps individualized placement sport right, for example, and that will take you to the scientific evidence about that intervention protocol. Just as an example."
16865.0,Patient,"And that's a great example because, like you said I actually have facts that I can back you know back this up with and i'm not just speaking just off the top of my head, this is real there's."
408.0,Provider,"Evidence nice yeah or if a higher ups as well, I guess, all we can do is and list. And then of course they'll you can say now, not only from your own experience with healthcare challenges. right but also now based on this evidence. Well, that may or may not be the best trajectory for."
16865.0,Patient,Exactly that's really good.
408.0,Provider,Depending depending.
16865.0,Patient,"And you know, and I hated doing research in school and now i've really understand just the just. The pure importance is like this is very valuable information and that's why we have to do research in the you know, in the master programs and. Because you're going to need these things that you're going to have to be able to back these things that you have more knowledge of things that you can provide for your clients."
408.0,Provider,"Yes, and the important thing to remember when you're feeling that you know aversive reaction to your research class is, you are not being asked or trained to do the research all you're being asked to do is to learn how to look for the best quality evidence for practice. And how to be able to read at least the abstract of that article that's that research report right. Yes to think about how does that apply to the client I have sitting in front of me. Right or the population, with whom I am working."
16865.0,Patient,That you're working with.
408.0,Provider,"Right so. When you get turned off just just think about it that way i'm not being trained to do this research. i'm just being trained in the terminology and the analysis of the written research report and how I can judge whether it applies to my clients and, if so, how. And that is supposed to be taught in practice classes, not just in research classes in your master's Program."
16865.0,Patient,"Not even started and. kind of felt like I just waiting for my semester wasn't going to be a good thing for me so i'm just gonna wait and try to go in the summertime because I want to see how my job worked out and everything, and again I didn't want to oh."
408.0,Provider,"absolutely understandable, it sounds like a good decision."
16865.0,Patient,"yeah I think it'd be a good thing, so I mean they're already sending me stuff about paying back."
408.0,Provider,"Oh, oh wow maybe not such a good decision."
16865.0,Patient,"But they were saying something about I just got an email, saying that they were extending some type of loan repayment program or something and it's like I don't know which ones are real and which ones are scams. Because I say you."
408.0,Provider,"Know here's what's real, so the federal government, the Biden administration has started an initiative and actually he could do it by executive order, it did not take Congressional approval, he was able, through executive order to delay. loan payback activation so it was delayed during the pandemic the early. party yes hey back even those who are graduated and completely out of school. He has extended that now. Okay, now I don't know the exact date offhand I just remember the announcement that it was being extended. And, of course, some members of Congress are objecting to that, but as of this point the you know there's been an extension of that time period where students with loans don't need to pay back. Now that's, not to say that you don't have to be in touch with your loan provider to request a specific specific deferment. So you can request a deferment due to job change and your attention to enroll in the summer or you may be able to. let's see they've already done registration, probably for the spring semester. As soon as registration opens for the summer or even. There might be this mini semester deal some I think you Ohio does have it a mini semester. in between."
16865.0,Patient,In between the spring and the summer.
408.0,Provider,"So the registration would be sooner for that. That comes before the summer registration usually. Okay, even if you have you know even that might qualify you for continued loan deferment, as long as you can show your enrolled at whatever rate of pursuit, you were doing before."
16865.0,Patient,All right.
408.0,Provider,That might help you it's worth looking at.
16865.0,Patient,But he is.
408.0,Provider,But you can't avoid it. you've got no he.
16865.0,Patient,"is not going to just go away, you have to. can see what's going on."
408.0,Provider,"And you're better off if you. If you do it either, and appeal or. Yes. A deferment because you're missing a semester, or whatever."
16865.0,Patient,"Is. I think i'm going to have to do an appeal anyway, because where I mean my medical issues and i'm just like i'm not trying to go through have to try to pay back all his money, it does moment."
408.0,Provider,"No, no that's. That you're gonna just they just."
16865.0,Patient,know they. Were but. I had an incomplete and I didn't do well in my class so.
408.0,Provider,"i'm saying now that you've got to try to avoid. Yes, because with your loan it's actually This is true of the GI bill to is actually better to flunk the class that take an incomplete."
16865.0,Patient,"Well, I be no."
408.0,Provider,I know that's because if you fail the class they'll let you retake it.
16865.0,Patient,"Yes, and see and."
408.0,Provider,Long as your overall GPA is.
16865.0,Patient,"GPA yes in the in I have to. And that's what I was trying to do was just X them was it too late for me to just go ahead and retake the course versus me just not. feeling that I have to wait till I think this week i'm going to try again to get back in touch with the department heads and see what I can do about that, because my mom just was not there."
408.0,Provider,"And I would recommend you call your loan provider or. me the fine print or whatever it is again understand their policies. In completes compared to failing a class and re taking a class and how, and then, of course, always think about how that affects your GPA. Yes, because then for the school standpoint, you know in GPA to get so low that they have grounds to terminate."
16865.0,Patient,terminate yes.
408.0,Provider,But there's two different bodies right you've got your loan policies and you have your school Paul.
16865.0,Patient,can do me yes that's true now that you.
408.0,Provider,"got to slow time at work, you should You should read the fine print on that. Yes, see what your best strategy is. Okay, and that will be much less stressful even if it's not great news it'll be much less stressful than what you're going through."
16865.0,Patient,"Now is better to now. Instead of just being in limbo, and not in probably putting more stressed and I this unnecessary."
408.0,Provider,Any right it's like sticking your fingers in your ears to say.
16865.0,Patient,"I had a bad habit of doing that I do, I mean because I was shut down and just like like oh God I don't want I don't want here i'm just I don't know why I do that and a lot of times I found that it's nowhere near. The capacity that I thought you know negative, you know impact that I thought it was going to be it's like a lot of times when I taking care of this, this week versus three weeks later, I could have had an even better outcome than what I did, in the end. Exactly exactly right, whereas when you avoid and."
408.0,Provider,"procrastinate as and we're working to work on the resignation. Yes, but if it's if you're just kind of afraid of it it's so immersive."
16865.0,Patient,that's Why is.
408.0,Provider,"He you know, then you can tell yourself, and this was actually a cognitive behavioral therapy technique. Is a reasonable counter active self statement. You say to yourself, I am resourceful. I can find a strategy to handle this. If I move forward and get the information. And i'm not just saying that as some kind of self help blah blah mantra you've demonstrated, through your life experience that you are resourceful."
16865.0,Patient,mm hmm.
408.0,Provider,"So just remind yourself of that. Alright, so before we conclude this session let's go over the effects of you're taking your medication later. Okay right which you wanted to just try out and see what that was like did it have an adverse effect on your driving. No Okay, was it helpful to what you were doing this week at work. Yes, yeah I think you said yes earlier right yes. What about the afternoon dose What did you try out with that."
16865.0,Patient,"It really instead of me having to where i'm taking it later instead of me. having to take like at one o'clock I can actually wait more until like three o'clock because I, my day is an over at that point, I still have two more hours at work, plus drive home and then take care of my responsibilities at home and it didn't affect my sleep."
408.0,Provider,It did not okay. And how about your eating.
16865.0,Patient,"i've actually started to try to eat lunch help there have been taking my lunch with me, which consists of either grill you know. Real chicken and you know, like a green salad and i've been by my fresh fruit, you know i've had pineapples and blackberries and I did some watermelon but it wasn't good, so I just said no i'm not going to do that so and then i'm going to try to start doing my smoothies again."
408.0,Provider,And so they were sent you stayed away from the vending machines.
16865.0,Patient,"Yes, absolutely and we have a daily there. And I walk past it every day like i'm fully with this brand all this bread and and i'm not going to do that, so I just continue to you know just try to eat healthier because I really need to lose some weight because it'll help with my knees honestly my knees haven't been that bad lately."
408.0,Provider,"Oh good. Well, and of course the other issue with eating, besides the healthier eating is you were you were not eating in the morning and so then there's the issue of energy level throughout the day but also the absorption of your ADHD. Treatment medication right so having whatever meal you're having far enough away from the afternoon does that it's not interfering with the efficacy of it. Right, it sounds like that's what you're doing."
16865.0,Patient,"This when I would try and do because I even took crackers to work like he said, if I felt like I was you know hungry at some point, I would just need some crackers snack on the crackers and like cheese and then. I would just try to stay busy just trying to find things different things to do so, then you know a lot. It helped out and I wasn't starving, by the time I did eat."
408.0,Provider,"Good The other day I. Yes, I agree that then the vending machines are calling cheap."

Okay, and a could be taken care of any remaining required paperwork for your new job. Okay, he could be. contacting your loan provider about your student. loans and and finding out if you need to do a different procedure. and see could be contacting your university and finding out if they have a mini master and you already need to ask your loan provider what the impact is, if you do take a class during. Or, right after the spring semester before the fall the summer semester starts what's the impact on their notice to you to pay back your loans. Okay, does it affect it in any way so that could be a sample ABC for one day. And then, it sounds like you do want to continue the the solutions that you selected from last time about the timing of your ADHD medication. Yes, and your lunch."
16865.0,Patient,"Okay, and I have a perfect but notebook for that I have this painters that I haven't I have prioritizing organized written on here, so this will be good for it because it has the lines and then it's top you know it has like.
