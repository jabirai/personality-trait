16118.0,Patient,How are you.
148.0,Provider,"i'm doing well, thank you, do you have any questions before we get started this morning. No Okay, though, since this is our first time meeting together. i'm just going to be asking you some questions today. Sure, so let's start with what brings you to treatment and why now."
16118.0,Patient,"and Actually, I am recently I can't concentrate like before I think I. and not as motivated as before you know I i'm doing my masters of data, science and because it was too hard, all of the courses for me. And because my background is not computer science is not related I took a turn off to be able to study and and you know, to study the courses that I couldn't understand well during my. my previous quarter previous term, but while i'm taking this term off to study I can't you know concentrate, I think I waste my time sometimes and. I am i'm not using my time, the way that I wanted to, and also previously, I was so depressed as well, but because i'm taking sertraline 50 milligrams I think it actually affected me very, very well and. Yes, and why now I used to you know go to a therapist about three four years ago and I worked with her for about in about one year. And I it was awesome it was great for me and it helped me a lot, you know because i'm from originally from Iran and a migrated to the US seven years ago, at that time, I felt, you know so lonely so. So depressed because it was alone, I was so far from my family members, I didn't have anyone here in the. In the US, and it took me a while to you know to overcome all of these you know and depression fears that I had you know living here alone and watch now I am much better than before, but I still am and dealing with some problems like you know concentrating and. You know, being motivated like before. that's it."
148.0,Provider,"Okay, great Thank you um and do you have a history with substance use."
16118.0,Patient,No okay.
148.0,Provider,"And you mentioned that you have seen a therapist before. Yes, you had any other mental health treatment in the."
16118.0,Patient,No that's it.
148.0,Provider,"And then do you have a history of suicidal ideation homicidal ideation or self harm. growing up what was your family life, like."
16118.0,Patient,"My my family, I just want to ask this one question is, I know that you're recording our session and are you going to you know share it with anyone."
148.0,Provider,"No, it doesn't get shared with anybody."
16118.0,Patient,"Because it's very important for me that you don't share it with anyone, especially usc is because. usc is is the immigration and because i'm getting my Green Card I don't want to affect my Green Card application negatively."
148.0,Provider,"ya know everything that we talked about in our sessions remains confidential, the only reason I would have to break your confidentiality is, if you reported. You know, a plan to hurt yourself or somebody else."
16118.0,Patient,"um okay got it up, no problem yeah okay uh when I was growing up unfortunately my parents used to fight a lot and. We never we never could you know prove that but I think my father, at some point was was cheating on my mom and my mother and I. I had actually a father that he is not very he's so selfish my my dad is so selfish my mother, on the other hand, is so devoted to family. In a way, that sometimes, I feel that I feel bad because I feel that i'm guilty that's my mother is so devoted to me and my sister sometimes I think that she is not caring about herself and she's only devoted to me and my sister Sometimes I feel guilty about that. And when I was growing up. My parents and you know, try to. To you know financially to. grow and help our family, sometimes I can't you know find the exact words in English sorry."
148.0,Provider,hey you're doing great.
16118.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you, and they actually try to you know. A to grow financially to support their children, I only have one younger sister. There are just two of us, and she currently she's married she lives in Montreal Canada. And my my parents are in Canada as well, and they are not in Iran anymore and and I did my parents will not come here and lived in come here today to the US and live with me and. My I only have a small studio about 510 square feet and sometimes they feel that if they want to come here live with me, I will get crazy. You know I can phrase, because you know my parents always fight they always they already know they are fighting with each other and they're arguing all the time they're so loud and. And I think my daddy's always you know my dad is like child and also he's so selfish and my mother, you know my mother actually behave sometimes very strangely, especially in front of other people and it's so embarrassing you know to just you know. show my mom to my friends, because it's she's she's behaving so strangely and my my sister now tells me because my parents are currently with my sister girl living with. them and and my sister told me that they actually did a lot of weird things in front of her friends and she was so embarrassed my sister and I don't like this happened to me and. There are just some there are a lot of things that going on in my mind right now and. I don't know how to overcome that you know when they come here and. You know, on one hand it's good that I won't be lonely anymore, but on the other hand, you're too close I didn't like them to live with me, I like them to leave you now and in another appointment, but financially it's not doable for them right now. And so, they have to live with me. And yeah."
148.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay, do you know when they're going to be coming."
16118.0,Patient,"And my mom is coming in, before Christmas, and my dad will come in five months."
148.0,Provider,Okay okay so that's soon um let's see did anybody in your home life struggle with mental health substance abuse or any other issues.
16118.0,Patient,"And not substance use, but my mother and always she has a depression and, yes, and she she used to you know, for a long time she used to have some medic medication fluoxetine I think if I can pronounce it correctly fluoxetine and then sertraline and bought. Nuts NUTS anything else, but you know she used to be so depressed and behave so may know weirdly strangely okay okay."
148.0,Provider,mom struggles with.
16118.0,Patient,Depression yes.
148.0,Provider,"um all right, and then what was school like for you and I know that you mentioned that you're currently in a master's program correct."
16118.0,Patient,"Yes, um I came to the US with a student visa and at that time I was doing that I was doing my PhD in business administration and then. right before I defend my dissertation I decided to change my carrier to data science because. I didn't like you know. PhD in business and I just could come to the US with this actually program and then I decided to. switch to data science and then I applied for some universities, I went to northwestern university again i'm doing that online now and. My background was not computer science and I took some classes on you know at city college of San Francisco but still this program it's so so hard for me and. them, and you know for for each quarter it's quarter based on in each quarter, we should take two courses. In order to be full time students and then using federal loan and they have to study full time. I only can handle one course per per you know quarter it's too much for me it's so hard for me, and especially the language is English and also. The background like I didn't know anything about programming and coding and it's so so heavy for me, and so I took one term off this term. To you know to you know, review the map the courses that they couldn't understand well at the beginning was Okay, but now I think I I can't you know concentrate they can't focus. And I don't know to be honest with you, I can't explain why I can't you know study now, but this is the way that I am in these days and. I really like this masters, I really like data science and because I want to know build a good future for me and financially to support myself and my family I need to become a data scientist to you know to. My income is much better than other careers, so I need this to you know to work, work, for me, I need to complete my program and find a good job and. This pressure, I think, is. worsening my my my situation now and. This expectation that I have for myself, and also because my friends know about it, I think. The pressure is much. is too much for me and, while in this in this time I wanted you know to. Review two courses, but I even couldn't finish the first horse yet, and I have only until January to finish them and after that they should go back to school and yeah it actually, I feel that i'm disappointed from his cell and. This is not good."
148.0,Provider,"That sounds like a lot of pressure that you're feeling right now putting on yourself. Yes, yeah okay um. let's see did you ever served in the military. Do you have any financial or legal issues you're concerned about. Are you in a relationship."
16118.0,Patient,"I was, but I. broke up with my boyfriend about two months ago. And I decided to. Not date anyone until I get a job, because you know I think that's one of the reasons that I couldn't study the way that I wanted to was my relationship that. To my retirement, I actually had when I started my program I am I dated two different people you know, after a broker with one of them, and then I. started another relationship went another one, and they think to these two guys actually because it was not a healthy relationship they slowed me down and I don't want it to happen again, so I decided to you know stop dating until I get a job okay."
148.0,Provider,"Good so you're putting yourself first. Good and do you have any children. No Okay, and then you mentioned that you live alone right now right until your parents come to live with you."
16118.0,Patient,"Yes, yes okay."
148.0,Provider,"Good good um okay Those are all the questions I have for right now, did I miss anything, or is there anything else do you want to share with me today."
16118.0,Patient,"And yeah as i'm as a girl living in a growing up in Iran, I hate, my country, my home country, I hate it literally, and I was actually. I I experience a lot of discrimination against women in that country and it's so weird that it's only me that's I hate this country that much. Other girls they you know they are girls as well, my friends, but they never had such experience they you say don't know it's Okay, we sometimes like to travel to Iran and it's not that bad that you're saying you're talking about while they had the same actually experiences, like me, but. They don't hate this country that much as I do and. I think you know, I was so sensitive and I wanted to be an independent girl, I wanted to be free, and you know in that country, we have to know the compulsory he job is. It was so it was too much for me I couldn't you know accepted and my whole life, I came to the United States, when I was 28 years old and no I never used to you know this compulsory hey job you want never and. and All the guys that I know, most of them, and you know they have you know old fashioned mindset. You know, I was talking to a couple of my friends, they are guy friends and my girlfriends and they were talking that that the the wants, you know to. date a girl that's, for example, this is just an example that you understand what I mean that we like to date, a girl, that is, you know seven five years, more than five years. younger than us and I told them that you know you want a girl to you know financially to be equal with you in the US, because in Iran. Then guys, should you know take care of all the financial and other financial things in home, but so when they come to the US they think that okay in this country girls, you know financially are dependent, independent and they can you know, contribute to them at home. financially and but on the other hand, they say that you want to have you know, a girl that is much younger than us if we want to marry that girl, I think this is not right, if you want, you know to be quality should be calling other you know aspects as well and. I had this actually argue with him because i'm 35 and they were telling me that Zahra you should you know. find a guy and married as soon as you can I told him no I don't want to you know date anyone into like a find a job, and you know age is not that. You know, big deal for me, but you know all the guy friends that I have their uranium, they have the same actually opinion and it's so bad, I really can't handle you know these kind of thinking and. I think you know, to be honest, I think i'm so different from other my friends my other Romanian friends so different I am and. Sometimes these conversations really hurt me and. You know, when I was growing up in Iran, I used to know. argue with all of my teachers, you know my family members, my friends, everyone about your ideas opinions and now even now, because you know I in here I can't I have some American friends, but with my uranium friends. We share a lot of things we can have more fun, but these conversations really hurt me, and I think sometimes I am so sensitive about these things and I don't like to be like that, but this is the way I am and I cannot do anything to help it."
148.0,Provider,"Well, I think that talking about it could help to you know release some of the. The power in that, because if you hold on to that it's just sitting in you right. I think you care so much about this, because you care about your independent and you don't want to feel dependent on another person. You know yeah you really care deeply about yourself, is what i'm. Hearing when you talk."
16118.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, because you know in such countries that Muslim countries i'm not Muslim anymore, because you know it was born in that country, and I was born like not as a Muslim, but you know I didn't like to become Muslim, so I not Muslim anymore, but. Even my friends or I must do they were born Muslims are not practicing Islam, they are actually doing everything that's against Islam rules. But I think that. Because they grew up in that culture, something you know, a stick to their mind. And they cannot change it, it went to their subconscious and. They cannot change it and. Then yeah but you know these conversations really hurt me and I decided when I want you to know date after I find a job i'd like to only date no none Iranian people know, besides, you know American people I think my point might my my view my opinions are. Really, so you know so similar to Americans not uranium."
148.0,Provider,yeah yeah yeah and that's okay right.
16118.0,Patient,"Yes, that's Okay, yes, I like to date, you know other nationalities. Good before. But I think I was not successful at what at that time my English was not that good and. I couldn't communicate with them that will, so I think this time it's gonna be different."
148.0,Provider,"yeah yeah your English is great and i'm really impressed with you. yeah i'm okay Sorry, I want to thank you for answering all my questions today and sharing so much with me we're scheduled to meet for 30 minutes every other week. been put in a group yet.
