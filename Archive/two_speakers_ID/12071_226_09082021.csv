226.0,Provider,yeah good okay good so did they put him on any kind of medication Vanessa.
12071.0,Patient,"yeah. So the walk city. i'm. just done allergy Hello ranting. Okay, and that's about it."

12071.0,Patient,What yeah they told me to to pull my medications away and to. Put like all like like stuff that she could get her with away.
226.0,Provider,"Is he still feeling suicidal. Okay did was he able to meet with a with a therapist when he was in there, do you know if. yeah okay."
12071.0,Patient,And I got to meet with them to.
226.0,Provider,How did that go.
12071.0,Patient,It went good and actually found out like some stuff was going on with him and. He was feeling like sometimes i'm I ignored him and I didn't know that.
226.0,Provider,Did he give you any kind of specifics about how he feels like you're ignoring him.
12071.0,Patient,Just that i'm always watching TV.
226.0,Provider,"Alright, so let's talk about ways, you can engage more with him what's your son's name again Jose."
12071.0,Patient,De john.
226.0,Provider,"Your little ones Jose right. yeah okay um so let's talk about ways that you can engage where he's not going to feel like you're ignoring him that his needs aren't getting met by you so. Or maybe have you talked to him about that have you guys discussed it at all. No okay. So here's what I would recommend I would talk to him, and I would say to him. I want to spend time with you and let's let's carve out time every single day that you and I have so that could be does he, like nature, like you, like nature. yeah Okay, so that could be like going for a walk out in nature that could maybe be just like sitting down outside talking, it could be. Whatever he likes to do like where you're engaging with him, so what you want to focus on is not watching TV, so what your focus. and Your focus should be like on the kids and like what they need, because I think what happened for you Vanessa is that you felt like. Like you felt like they didn't want to be with you, or you felt like you weren't enough to be with your kids and that's not true because of your addiction okay. So your addiction obviously pulls you away from the people that you love that's just what it is that's the nature of addiction. And that's all changing because you're on medication and you're clean and you're available and you're making all these great changes. So that's good so now, you know what was going on with your son and so now, you get to change it, and you get to make these positive changes so you can reconnect with him. So what are some things that he likes to do."
12071.0,Patient,"I was thinking of maybe trying to. Look, for some games with a play at walmart like those poor games. That were um maybe something like an activity to play outside."
226.0,Provider,yeah totally yes.
12071.0,Patient,"Because I was thinking, maybe two hours just maybe a little depressed. bed not. not getting up."
226.0,Provider,All right.
12071.0,Patient,I want to change that it's. You know if if if that's what it takes for my son to feel like that that's what i'll do.
226.0,Provider,"yeah So let me ask, are you feeling, are you still feeling depressed like you need okay okay good so Dr Solomon put you on so locked right."
12071.0,Patient,"Now i'm he did, but it wasn't working so yeah he put me on the abuse Brown and that's helping a lot."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, great okay good. So yeah so you want to continue to take the medication, so you don't feel so depressed and now you get to. You get to start engaging with your kid you get to start engaging and he wants to go to his game tonight, which is really a good sign that's a great sign and are you going to go there and be there. yeah. Perfect he just needs you he needs to you know, like kids just need their moms they need to know that moms there that moms available, they need to know that. yeah mm hmm and they need to know like, even if they don't need you, that you're still there, that they can rely on you and that you're going to show up and you're going to be there and you're going to. You know, make them dinner and get up in the morning before they go to school, and all that stuff so those kind of changes will make a huge difference in his life."
12071.0,Patient,"Okay, great."
226.0,Provider,"And I love that. love the board game idea I love going out in nature, with him, like you know spending time with kids it doesn't mean that you have to spend a lot of money to do that right it's just does he like to like coke or do you like to cook."
12071.0,Patient,"yeah um I do but i'm Shannon what I have a hard time with is getting him to talk to me about what's going on with him yeah. I don't know how to go about. talking with him like. yeah I guess why I asked him, but he. wouldn't tell me, but maybe i'm going about it in a. Not a good way."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so tell me how you go about it when you know that he seems sad or like there's something bothering him, what do you say to him."
12071.0,Patient,Are you okay what's going on with you can tell me. He says no. You won't understand he says.
226.0,Provider,"yeah. So. that's not uncommon for boys his age okay not uncommon. So you want to just keep reassuring him that you're there for him and that you love him, and you know when he says that you won't understand you can say something like you know what I might understand because i've had some struggles of my own, and I know what it's like to be sad. And and it's okay to be sad because i'm here for you. And when I was growing up, nobody was there for me, and I want it to be different for you i'm making these changes, because I love you. And it's really about like like being honest with him Vanessa because you have had struggles and Look how strong, you are, you know, like look at where you are now like you've survived a lot of traumatic events your dad passing you know your mom is a challenging woman to get along with. you're very you're so kind and caring and empathic and sometimes it's hard when you're that when you feel the way you feel. And you can share with him things you can."
12071.0,Patient,"Access sounds like such a great idea because I never even. I never even thought of that i'd seen that and because some. Maybe I thought in my mind, he wouldn't understand."
226.0,Provider,"So I think as parents, we want to protect our kids from the world and from we want to protect them from our hurts and our troubles, and all the stuff that has gone on with us, but in reality, I think it's really healthy to share with them. Now I know what pain is I have dealt with pain, I have gotten through pain, I have felt so sad inside or I have felt so bad about myself but i've gone through, and this is how i've done it. And I want you to know that i'm here for you. And that's that's really about, because a lot of times kids won't go Oh, what happened, they won't ask but it's just they know that you know what it's like to hurt. Right and you can even be honest with him and say that you know my my drug use was really about me not knowing how to handle my pain. And my drug use wasn't about me not loving you or not wanting to be with you, it was me not knowing how to deal with me. And I take responsibility for that and i'm making changes and be honest with them and let them know that you're meeting with a counselor and that you're doing group. And that you're talking about famous that you've never talked about because it's really important for your mental and emotional health."
12071.0,Patient,And maybe it'll make Kim not want to do that.
226.0,Provider,"And maybe he'll he you and I, you and your son will have you know he can relate, because he was feeling really bad he was feeling like you wanted to hurt himself and that's really just an indication of how he's feeling inside, obviously."
12071.0,Patient,"You know, like screaming out for help."
226.0,Provider,"yeah things got too much for him, like he wasn't talking, he was keeping all of that inside and he didn't feel like anybody would understand. Even though he's surrounded with family and he has friends and mean you understand what that's like, if you think if I say something nobody's gonna care nobody's going to understand. And so that's where he was coming from so you want to keep him engaged in. football and you know you want to just tell him that you love and all of your kids you want to tell them every day that you love them and that do they need anything. And that you're there for them and and that you're here always there for them if they need to come to you and talk to you."
12071.0,Patient,On that and that's so good that i'm meeting with you because. you're kidding me it's great advice that. I wouldn't have known if I wouldn't have met you. yeah.
226.0,Provider,"You know and see here's the thing, and I want you to understand this Vanessa it's like it's hard like you know it's difficult. When you don't have anybody to talk to right and when you're getting off drugs and you're wanting to make all these changes, you know that's a big step that you've taken. And these are things that you've just never been able to talk to people about and so now you are and it's so great that you're able to do that, you know and. You know just your participation and group zone is really great and and and when we talk, you know you have really, really great things that you bring to our sessions and. you're learning how to be the mom that you know you always wanted to be you're just you're just you're just needing a little bit of guidance, because you know inside how to do it it's just I think there's a little bit of apprehension because there's some guilt and there's you know."
12071.0,Patient,A lot of a.
226.0,Provider,"Right, you know there's some fields in there some shame, and I think some some unkind words that have been said to you by family members that are not not they're not necessarily true. But it's it's not nice when people are cruel like that, so I want you to focus on having self confidence in yourself as a person and as a mom. Because you can do this, you are doing this."
12071.0,Patient,Yes.
226.0,Provider,Right.
12071.0,Patient,And i'm on. The right path.
226.0,Provider,I don't know why.
12071.0,Patient,i'm a recovery right path.
226.0,Provider,"path, and so I think that what you can also focus on is. Like going to bed every night at the same time and waking up every night at waking up every morning at the same time, so you want to be able to you kind of want to be on the kids schedule so you're going to bed like around the time they go to bed, and then you're. Waiting yeah and then you're waking up in the morning before they wake up so you're there for them like to get them. ready yeah do you do lunches and all that or did they eat at school."
12071.0,Patient,"yeah um well they yeah we've but they just been eating at home, because our my little in house, because he hasn't started yet. I mean, he started with it at home still."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, when is he going to be in the classroom."
12071.0,Patient,I think it's gonna start on Monday.
226.0,Provider,Was that because I Kobe.

226.0,Provider,"Okay, God. forbid. Alright, so he'll be back okay So what about your dad is your daughter in school still."

12071.0,Patient,"She lives with her dad so listen to me and she's a great role model for them, if only if we could be in her life, you know she would be such a great role model of my voice, because she's a good kid she's on am be Honorable."
226.0,Provider,that's so good that she just choose not to have contact right now.
12071.0,Patient,"No her dad don't let her see me it's her dad it she wants to see me, she said mom when I turned 18 I can see you I said, of course, you can see me. I said i'll always be here waiting whenever whenever i'm here, you know because I respect her dad's decisions because he taking care of all this time, so. I know he should give me a right to see here but. um he don't but maybe the right time. she'll she'll find it the right time, when I guess he's ready."
226.0,Provider,This you know that you're clean.
12071.0,Patient,"yeah um and and I know I haven't got to really let them know about it but um i've been reaching out to the social services and they've been like given the messages for me, and this also services set what up to him and what he wants to do with what ever message we tell him."
226.0,Provider,And when will your daughter be 18.

226.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, so do you feel like you have enough energy to give to both the boys, do you feel like you've got time to be with them."
12071.0,Patient,yeah I do and and I have them. I have scars that remind me like. of my past that I wish I didn't have my arms and and I think that's what really gets me so upset at myself.
226.0,Provider,So from abscesses you mean or.
12071.0,Patient,yeah from surgeries and stuff that. I use.
226.0,Provider,yeah so Have you had surgery on your for your abscesses.
12071.0,Patient,yeah mm hmm.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so you know, instead of looking at those scars as a negative, you can look at those scars as like a positive like you've survived this and that these scars remind you of where you don't want to do again."
12071.0,Patient,"And things like that they're not fresh you know, like that they're not all bruised up in."
226.0,Provider,"Right right and that those those scars are from the past and they represent your past and that moving forward those scars gives you strength. and courage to move forward, so you don't have to go back to that place that you were when those scars are happening, and you know scars are way of reminding us of you know, some good things, and some bad things like Okay, so these scars are just remind me of what I don't want to do. So, try and reframe that in your mind if you can. don't let them. don't let those scars hold you back okay."
12071.0,Patient,i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna be positive in and think that i'm just tougher stronger person with the scars.
226.0,Provider,"Yes, that's right it's like. it's like you know Armor like wearing a suit of Armor you know the scars represent like your suit of Armor and all the the battles that you fought and that you've won because you're standing and you're here and you're thriving."
12071.0,Patient,"In public God wanted me to have them to tell my story, maybe in the future."
226.0,Provider,"that's right absolutely that's right so just keep you know, praying and keep taking your medication and keep making attempts to just reconnect with the boys, you know just bring them into your life again the way you want it okay."
