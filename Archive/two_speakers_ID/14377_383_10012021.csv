383.0,Provider,"So um this appointment is going to be structured I have questions to ask you, and these are things you may have already been asked, and other appointments are are filled out in forms and I apologize for you, having to kind of repeat yourself we. In the future appointments, it can be far less structured, but this first initial appointment is an assessment appointment so."
14377.0,Patient,"Okay, and then I also was. that's good and I I was curious how we're going to do this anyway i'm. no idea what i'm doing."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, no problem i'm just a question, do you see another therapist outside of bright heart health. No okay so basically we I have, I see folks every other week so you're in group every week and then you have your therapy every other week."
14377.0,Patient,"She said I wasn't going to be doing group yet Okay, and is there any way that I could see somebody every week."
383.0,Provider,"um well typically we can I can schedule an appointment for you. Every week for a short period, but then it trance goes to sort of every other week. that's generally how things roll that in our Program. And I do find that actually those two weeks go by really quickly we work I work with homework and you, you know do your own work with. The assignments, that we do."
14377.0,Patient,Perfect perfect I was hoping for something like that yeah.
383.0,Provider,"And then it goes by very quickly and it kind of gives you more time to kind of take a deep dive into some of some of the homework and self reflection that you're doing. But, and then you know, initially, we can we can do so few appointments back you know we we tweak my schedule is pretty jammed so it's sometimes it's even it's hard to get that weekly appointment also that's some of the dilemma. yeah you can see how it goes for you and we can yeah so feel free to ask me any other questions, did you have any other questions about."
14377.0,Patient,"yeah I. Well, I have a lot of questions about how this was going to work and whether we're going to talk about expectations or not, but. Where i'm at right now, there were a few things that I would really like to get some help with if I can. i'm in the middle i'm going to be starting a new job soon i'm doing interviews."
383.0,Provider,And i'm.
14377.0,Patient,"going to be in a different environment than I was before. So the. ability to the not be having to shut down for the panic attacks or not being able to sleep all night long or the anxiety panic attack you know that day long today long it's not going to work. So any any help any tricks I would love to just apply do as much work and apply as much as I can to just at least get to a space where i'm like. sleeping and I can show, at my old job I could just not show up I could have someone cover the shifts my supervisor knew what was going on i've been there, eight years it was Okay, you know, and I could autopilot so. If I had like flashbacks when they happened at work. I could just autopilot is extremely uncomfortable, but I could pull it off. And the other thing is that right now. Well, just real quick I I made kind of a three year plan a four year plan of like don't worry about half the families, I really, really wanted one, but like. The idea was to get as physically healthy as possible as financially healthy as possible and as emotionally healthy as possible, before I have kids. And so I knew I was going to do this. But now i'm in a space where. I have such a good support system. Like I have safe places setup, I have three friends, because i'm in alcoholics anonymous, I have three friends. That we've all been friends well over five years, but we all touch base with each other, multiple times a day, and they are they now know fully what I do with them what I don't deal with, so my support is right there. Real good sponsor i've been working with for years. I have my spawn sees so I have my ability to like separate. I have, like my meditation spaces, I have my like places to go to feel better like sequoia Park, I have a home group in town and I have a home group online so i'm kind of i'm single so i'm in a real good space to be miserable and like be okay. You know what I mean so."

The spaces, that you go to to try to feel a bit better so you're you're you know you're already doing, and have done it, it seems like you've done a lot of good work."
14377.0,Patient,"Thank you well and i've been sober for 15 years I turned 15 in April, and I also did a lot of ACTA i'm not sure if you're aware of that, but it's adult children of alcoholics work and so. 14 years ago I was working on like you know, being a parent to the little girl inside and protecting the little girl I what I think. Well it's gotten pretty apparent I think i've taken as far as I can, so I have a lot of self awareness, which I hope will help here. And i'm good with seeing uncomfortable things I don't like and being uncomfortable and I know I can walk through it and be okay, on the other side. But I think i've taken the you know i've worked the steps seven times i've done a CA I think i've taken that train about as far as I can, and Ian died about three years ago and all hell broke loose."

I can call her, no matter what we have a deal, where I always answer the phone she calls. I love her dearly she's a real good codependent she doesn't know that anything's wrong at any time and. She has fluctuated over my life, where she came in and was a real good mom and then decided she didn't want to be a mom anymore and ducked out and left me and my brother and my sister while she came up to northern California to live her life. and real a lot of a lot of a lot of stuff in there."

Step dad was the monster, you know. chasing me around the House throwing me into walls, putting me through TVs hitting me like a man kidding me like so hard that my blood would come through my skin I didn't realize how extreme it was until kind of recently. Just and and he started molesting me around eight or nine all the way until about 11 or 12 when I got older, it was getting sicker and more dramatic and around 1112 all of a sudden my mom was gay they were getting a divorce, which was fantastic. And, and then all of a sudden my mom was gay, I have a lot of problem with that he moved up down the street so me and my brother my sister, I have a little sister and a little brother. Who I watched a lot, I felt very protective of and then he made a comment which, let me know that he was starting to molest my little sister and I tanked and that was, I believe, when I was 11. I became suicidal it's the only time i've ever been suicidal I actually tried to hurt myself. And my mom's. girlfriend. is the one who pulled it out of me, and all this and after that shortly after that I found drugs, I was kicked out of the House we played the kick out runaway game around 13 by 14 I was kicked out of the House."

Leave and she picked me out of the House at 15 1415 years old i'm the violence. My step dad first time I remember him hitting me and it blood coming up out of my hand he was hitting me a lot, he was really in hindsight. is pretty gnarly when I was in kindergarten or when I was like five years old, six years old, then my sister was born. And he was I feel like he hit me with this with a block I don't know if that's true or just something i'm thinking I got the belt a lot, like the Irish spring soap and the belt I got feed I got hit a lot. By the by five six years old and it just kept on, though."
383.0,Provider,Was there any other history of violence or incarceration in your family.
14377.0,Patient,"So I don't think so. I have no idea about inside of the family, and I assume so but I don't know. And my mom's family know it's like i'm supposed to be a doctor or a lawyer. My p's and q's dotted you know and i'm saying they're very and my dad's family, I have no idea, but they see I don't it doesn't seem like it from not knowing them on the outside."
383.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, thank you um in terms of your. own if you have issues with anger, have you had your own struggles with anger and anger outbursts."
14377.0,Patient,"Unfortunately, is the part that I don't normally would be honest with but I promised my best friend I would So the first guy I dated. Really, dated. would leave me black and blue and green and purple and then the next person I dated I thought that he started it, but we remain friends and years later he's like no, you are going was crazy. I came out of the abusive relationship, but I was in for a couple years in a row you're not going to get my face, and I would put him into the wall, but I think it was, I think we like immediately met each other at that space. And that was it. That was it and I did a lot of work, oh sorry my battery's low I did. I did a lot of work and I basically am in a space, I was in a space in early sobriety where i'm the worst I ever did was slam doors and I did so much work to slam the damn door, you know any like it took a lot of and so much anger so much anger, in fact. I was just about turn three or just after three and I have been doing so much work. So much writing and. Writing and writing and crying crying crying when is this going to go away when is this going to go away it's never gonna go away and the anger was gone. It was just gone and it was really odd I felt weird I was like what do I do with this, I felt really weird and uncomfortable it came back. But i'm the worst i've ever done, I had a I did I had normal relationships, where I just started it off, where no i'm not going to yell with you, we can talk about it now, we can talk about later, but i'm not going to raise my voice with you and starting it that way, kept it that way. And that was all the way through until. My fiance and I kind of got engaged to my step dad like zero to 60 screaming at me for saying horrible horrible things verbally abusive. And at that point, one day, I slammed the door again and ahead that was setup is actually a teenager and I slammed the door and something happened with. him, one day, I was in the kitchen and he's coming at me and I switched into this like a mama bear I don't know how to describe it like you've never heard that kind of tone come out of you know, and I was like stop yelling at me. In this like horribly big voice, and from that point on, I could not not match it like he would come at me i'd come at him, he would come at me i'd come in him."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, you speaking right now."
14377.0,Patient,"The stepfather, no, no, this is Seville, when I was 3031 this was the guy I got engaged to."
383.0,Provider,"Okay okay so. So you were in this relationship and your. I know there's been there's so many pieces and so many parts and in this appointment it's going to be hard for for us to get you know, the whole thing and so i'm just a general maybe. you're sharing the specific situations. Okay okay."
14377.0,Patient,"So, so I was never passed the guy I was in the abusive relationship right away. The next guy I ended up fighting back with physically it didn't last very long, and that was the end of it i've never been violent in a relationship. And what happens is I sheep up I Shell up so when they get an essay get an aggressive, if any, mail gets aggressive around me I turn into this like little sheep so i've taken self Defense classes and. All sorts of things, so I can defend myself and when it when it happens, I don't remember any of it, I turn into this little please don't hurt me think."
383.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, so in relation to your own anger from what you're telling me there's been ups and downs and there's been periods, where you have had. Where the anger comes out and then there's also. You know times when you withdraw is that just if you just."
14377.0,Patient,took a.
383.0,Provider,bath a full generalization but would that be accurate.
14377.0,Patient,"yeah I was extremely angry and when I got sober I started working on the anger and working on it more and more and more and I got to a really relatively peaceful space until. The man that I was engaged with started coming at me and then something just kind of snapped and I started going back at him. Okay um, but it was only with him and then it has not with her, I just I am still angry. But it's like i'm better and then like. Something a couple layers of the onion come off and up there saying you're again so, then I worked on it, I pray I ride I pray I worked on it and then i'm good i'm good i'm good enough there's the anger again so. Like levels. up. But i'm generally not I know i'm not violate i'm not. You know and pretty much not angry. happy and goofy and."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, thank you for not. Any current suicidal thoughts."
14377.0,Patient,I did a little. I tried to go back the last. Month just because I didn't know what we're gonna be talking about and I went through my text with my best friend on the 18th I definitely was. yeah.
383.0,Provider,"So, in terms of your suicidal thoughts now we're going to shift from, and I know you just shared like a whole lot so that might be bringing up. something you know might be bringing up a lot of feeling for you right now as we're speaking so I just want to acknowledge that that you know you've just been. Reviewing some traumatic events and anger and family and everything like that so um. So yeah it's good to take a breath yeah so in terms of now, so now we're going to shift to another topic which is very serious, as well, which is the suicidal history and your current suicide, as well as your current suicidal thoughts, you mentioned that at age 11 you had a suicide attempt. And you. haven't had a you had several suicide attempts, I did I actually."
14377.0,Patient,"I can't believe it because well. I actually did I was getting knives in the kitchen and trying to cut my arm and I couldn't like HALO the pain and then I got upset at myself. Because I was a worse, I really tanked. I have never been anywhere close to that, but when. The flashbacks and the thoughts that just won't stop and the nightmares all night long and the anxiety attacks and then it just wanting to go away, I got suicidal again so that was. 3736 years old, but not any any sort of plan, not in trying to hurt myself in it that sounds extreme and really unhealthy. But the thoughts of what God it just won't stop and I started I started thinking about suicide. Which scares the fanatic.

So when you feel comfortable and can you know feel like you can attend group, it probably would be really good thing."
14377.0,Patient,What is group is it like an A meeting.
383.0,Provider,"it's a group it's a group therapy, that is also combined with the medication providers, so you get some psycho education we talked about a particular topic like boundaries or anger or self soothing techniques. And then, after that chantelle will review people's medication needs, and if they need refills and so forth, so it's a it's an hour where those both both of those things take place. yeah so did she mentioned that you didn't you don't need to come to group."

383.0,Provider,"Friday the eighth. So if you can increase your exercise. Do. You know I don't know how comfortable we didn't really discuss the covert thing. I don't know how comfortable, you are going to a gym but if there's something you can do to just get get your body moving breathing you know could be yoga could be a Cardio just putting in your body moving and. I think that would be might be helpful for your sleep will see it's kind of an experiment with sleep that's not going to address the nightmares, but it could you know get the blood moving in your body and sometimes that is helpful for. You know, also just throwing out some tension as well. Okay, on a physical level but we'll talk more about that, but if between now and next week, if you could. You know coach yourself to get some exercise that would be great."

Okay, thank you crystal I will see you next week. Okay bye bye. All right, so crystal Decker she has a suicide risk in pulse, I would say my assessment with her is a low risk she has a does not report symptoms of depression. She is impulsive and she's. You know reporting that she's having some suicidal thoughts suicidal ideation, but they are quite passive without intent or plan just very strong social supports she's. Thinking about her future she's, so I think that her risk level is below this time, thank you."
