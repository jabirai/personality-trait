I don't know why we came here but i'm going to show you something okay. Okay, and i'm hoping we can we can share a sound. nervous system by triggering the nearest nerve the Vegas."
13785.0,Patient,"is different than most of the other nerves in our body, because it sends information in both."
214.0,Provider,From our bodies.
13785.0,Patient,"To our brain, so the Vegas nerve helps triggered the bottom up approach to resolving anxiety, the bottom up approach is basically the fact that a calm body can create a calm mind I recently heard a great story about this, a woman, adopted a dog."
214.0,Provider,that she found on the side of running around on the side of the road.
13785.0,Patient,"And this dog will great dog, it was good, with kids it was good, with families, it was wonderful to have around it was obedient and it listened to them. But the dog had one major drawback when they would put the dog in the car and take it anywhere like on a trip or to the park. The dog would freak out, it would just have a crazy anxiety response, and it would start to throw up in the back of the car so after this happened over and over again, and their their car was just smelling."
214.0,Provider,disgusting about this dungeon. Take your dog to a dog trainer.
13785.0,Patient,"and asked what do I do, I cannot figure out how to help this animal and the wise dog trainer said, in order to help this dog feel calmer. It needs to have a calm body first she taught the woman, how to direct the dog to sit down and lay down. And they constantly train for the dog to do that, so they bring it into the car have it laid down and force it into a relaxed position. And, as they did, that the anxiety that the dog was experiencing decreased and pretty soon the dog was not throwing up in the car anymore. This this story illustrates the principle that a calm body can create a calm mind ancient societies have known this for years, people practicing yoga or meditative breathing. Understand that we can change our minds reaction by changing our body and today i'm going to teach you a couple of techniques to do that, so the first technique i'm going to teach is diaphragm matic breathing. That means breathing with your stomach now most people don't realize it but they spend most of the day breathing with their chest, we have some ability to expand our chest. But when we only breathe with our chest we're about 70% less oxygenated than when we breathe with our stomach the diaphragm is a muscle that's right below rib cage and as we take a deep."
214.0,Provider,"breath pushes down very good pushes those abdominal organs out so in order to breathe with our diaphragm, we need to see our belly moving in and out. So one of the ways to do this, take your hands cross your fingers and put them on your stomach and then lean back a little bit in your chair."
13785.0,Patient,"and take a few deep breaths and try and get your hands to move out and you breathe. that's it die for matic breathing now, these are called self regulation techniques and they're called self regulation techniques, because you can regulate yourself. In any situation you don't have to leave the situation to calm down so relaxation, is where you go leave a situation take a hot bath get a massage. Now, if we could do that all day long we wouldn't have a problem with our nervous system, but the reality is we're often stuck at work or in stressful meetings stuck in a commute or traffic jam. And we need to be able to regulate our nervous system, during stressful experiences, not just avoiding stressful experiences. So dive chromatic breathing it's something you can do in a meeting you don't have to make a loud noise just sit there and take deep breaths and have your stomach move in and out it even helps a little if you put your hands behind your head lean back in your chair and take a deep breath."
214.0,Provider,"And you don't have to do it as loudly as that again, this is an activity, you can do during meetings phone calls, while we saw Edgar what What did you learn about this."
13785.0,Patient,alert or learn how to breathe.
214.0,Provider,"Right, but this is a specific, this is about getting the air in your belly right, and this is why she talks about you don't have to leave to come back you can stay there. Right, because when you when we. breathe with our bellies. We get all this oxygen in here and we can really help with bringing all the air and that will reduce your anxiety."
13785.0,Patient,Yes.
214.0,Provider,Do you think you can practice that.
13785.0,Patient,"Yes, I will."
214.0,Provider,"Thank you so much, so do you know when you have group next."

Depression too OK. OK alright guys i'll see you on the 27th."
