10225.0,Patient,Hello amanda.
383.0,Provider,hi Aaron how are you today.
10225.0,Patient,"Oh, a tiny bit better than usual. yeah um I i'm not sure what to attribute that to I. My medications help, of course, but. I think that I am. You know there's sometimes when I can't. get a guy in my mind I can't keep a realistic measure of. My obligations and what's coming up. and other times i'm better at it and I think these days, the last few days they haven't been on an onslaught. And i'm trying to pay attention to what happens when that happens, and so. I think that the panic comes when I when everything. Everything. comes in, it was and I get testifies. The whole thing. And i'm so i'm working in that direction i'm trying to stay and and I, you know i'm making more of an effort to stay on one subject at a time now I haven't. I haven't done much more, but I it feels like i'm heading in the right direction."
383.0,Provider,And you know when you said you're you feel like you're making more of an effort to just focus on one thing at a time. I think.
10225.0,Patient,"At least, at least if it i'm trying to. If it hops around i'm trying to. stay on it long enough to put it in perspective of. Not only. Its real importance, but you know where it stands on the list of things. And it seems I think outside stress is really uh. You know, puts me into the panic I you know I still I still have the same problem I don't enjoy anything I still am not you know not doing nearly as much as I could be doing, and probably should be doing. But. Anyway, that's what I mean by a tiny bit better."
383.0,Provider,Well i'm glad you can feel that progress.
10225.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yeah I also i've learned to balance i've learned to know. When and what to take in the day, as far as tranquilizers and. What part of the days worse more part of these better so. Those are balancing out to."
383.0,Provider,What what part of the day is better and.
10225.0,Patient,"The evening it's it's a it's psychology leftover from the past, the morning is the worst. And that's when I immediately as soon as I wake up, I, I have to take something to hatch the thoughts that I that always come up and they buffer the the hard part but that's because the the morning symbolizes when. That you know all my life than most people's lives a morning has been the time when you're obligated to start the day doing things and so the the afternoon and evening are easier on me because. The days over. Usually this and, of course, if I get anything done, of course, it's more satisfying but it's more relieving whether or not i've done anything productive. or not, because the day is done and and the pressure the site, you know the psychological pressure that I put that I attribute to these things. Right ah ease off."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10225.0,Patient,"So, and it doesn't always work that way, sometimes i'm i'm very stressed at night and. My once in a while a morning is not threatening unfortunately almost almost every morning is. Is the hardest time. it's unfortunately the angle of my apartment is such that the morning is also dark. You know the sun is comes up behind where the windows are. And anyway, you know it and i'm i'm i've always been over sensitive to things like my surroundings and. When they get bad enough, I I. resigned to them, but it'd be better to make them better."
383.0,Provider,"Right right, how was your sleep at night."
10225.0,Patient,"My sleep is okay. that's another problem with the morning is that it means I have to get up. I my dreaming is not unpleasant it's it's actually. more pleasant it's so far it's been more pleasant. than my waking. My waking life so sleep is is. A salvation I you can call it an escape I suppose it's an escape but, but it is a really."
383.0,Provider,"Sorry, so you don't have any problem sleeping at night, all the way through."
10225.0,Patient,"No, not usually."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm. Okay. Well that's a good thing.
10225.0,Patient,"yeah, it is a good thing, I hope I hope to goodness that last it's been like it's been. it's been lasting."
383.0,Provider,Have you had any visits with your friend.
10225.0,Patient,"No he's pretty busy so i've been pretty isolated again. i'm a little worried. That. My you know my condition is. And, of course, this could be you know, this could be be I forgot what the word is. But I think that that he he's kind of stand out and being standoffish with me. Because i'm not i'm no fun. Are i'm not it's not that i'm no fun it's just i'm not. i'm not fun like I used to be. and So. it's you know he does still value, he has some problems family problems and also business problems and he likes to talk to me about that because I seem to be able i'm one of the few people who knows who can follow him because I know him so well."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10225.0,Patient,"So anyway, though I I have not it's been a while, since I talked to him periodically but not not as but that doesn't happen as much either. But I have to add in that he is he is busy he. is always having. Problems disagreements with his wife, I think that's getting better, but he is trying to get through his. We get a law degree, you have a background check and he is that's, the only thing holding him back, and he has a he had he is getting a background jack and he's he's getting held up because he. He was in a court case was 20 years ago and found in contempt, once and that, unfortunately, is a holdup. And so he's he's fighting that he's he's hired a lawyer anyway. he's and he's and in the meantime he's also developing business around his potential law degree. and Preparing for the possibility that he may not get he may not be. allowed to pass the bar or you everything is you know the background is the only thing keeping them from being a full fledge lawyer. wow that's stressing."
383.0,Provider,Well it's nice he has you as a friend to talk to about all these ins and outs and that you know him so well.
10225.0,Patient,"yeah you'd like by sorry he hasn't got in touch with me I. contacted him a few times and he feels like he's busy, so I don't insist myself upon him. So yeah I like I say lately the contact has been. Less than it was."
383.0,Provider,How are you doing with just taking care of yourself your day to day self care and eating and that kind of thing.
10225.0,Patient,"I that that hasn't about the same. about the same. I. it's a challenge for me to get out. I you know I few weeks ago I. I did do some I did myself got myself tired out and. It was an eye at the end of the day, you know I mean since i'm so dorman. It was a workout just to do you know some. Continued activity for a while and the day and and at the in the evening, I felt good I felt like I had done something good, and so I thought well shoot you know. You got at least get out and take walks and I I did it the next day, and then I stopped. So I. So it's it's certainly a challenge to to get out I even think you know I I even think that a change of scenery even if there's no exercise is has some benefit."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10225.0,Patient,"And so, but. So it's not really the physical part of it it's it's getting out that door."
383.0,Provider,"it's like the one time, when you took the walk, you said you did take the walk well."
10225.0,Patient,"Well, it was it was OK, actually, and it it wasn't unpleasant and I thought. This I can do this every day I I should I used to take. Our long walks and I decided look just just you know there's a lot of testimony that says 20 minutes is fine just do a half hour and, and so I did that just fine and so, in my mind. No problem, and then I you know. I don't know what came up, but it certainly wasn't important, but it did start you know it did it did divert me from taking that walk and. they're in started the trend. I do get nervous walking out the door it's it's it's funny I. I was thinking about it, the other day I I walked I had to go get something to my car in my car and just walking down to the car my car is right outside it's you gotta go downstairs and then out to a lot. And just that made me nervous and I thought, what you know what what danger is there in this all i'm doing is walking to my car and grabbing something and coming back. My now things go on in my mind that I amplify. My landlady is a very festive festivities and. You know she she's got the money to have people come and clean every week, so you know she had, and she washes her Carl time my car has been sitting under a tree i've finally been able to get a space where that's not the case and it's it's really dirty. And I haven't. watched it yet so that goes on in my mind, you know I get self conscious about it being dirty and I can't you know those kind of things. I, I have to if I worry about them i'm less likely to take care of the problem, so washing you know, and I have to go to the car wash I can't do it here. But it's not that far away and it's not that much problem, it does take exertion and it does take getting out and doing something and there's a resistance to that. You know it's I I don't know if if that's what they call a Gore phobia I think agoraphobia specifically fear of people but it's it's you know it's a reluctance to get out side. I think I think that it may also. In the back of my mind. connote. obligation. and and thereby activity which I may make a mistake. In that activity and I. I dwell too much on on mistakes, which is unfortunate because it's that's just there's no productivity that. The most successful people in the world. The majority of them say that they come to welcome mistakes as as a way to learn how to not make them. I i've come to fear them I all my life I feared I feared the my I have my former therapist says, I have a perfection I have too much of a perfectionist attitude. And you wouldn't know it, by the way, I live, but but that that perfectionist attitude can't. You know, every it has too much in mind before it happens and little room for. For deviation from the plan."
383.0,Provider,"Well, it seems like you know a lot about your habits and tendencies um. it's. it's encouraging yourself to try something new and different or Oh, you know i'm gonna to not focus on my mistakes i'm going to focus on what i'm doing well. That it seems like it's hard to shift to shift out of those patterns that you do seem to know quite well, especially with also all the therapy that you've been in. So you're aware of your patterns it's just."
10225.0,Patient,"Yes, oh aware of them and understand them and understand some of why they happen, and yet. I don't. I, and I see you know in groups like this and in other groups that have nothing to do with Simon cowell not nothing to do in my other group which is. That, I think I told you about the zoom groups that I attend that deal with the course of miracles, there are a lot of people who. recognize what I recognize it then did something about it and. And, and so, sometimes I wonder what's missing in. In me that that doesn't. get up and do it's not I have very little argument. Well, I don't know if I should say that because I i'm not taking everything into account, but it feels like at least some of it, I very little argument against the solution. Intellectually. The fear is still there and. I don't know."
383.0,Provider,"yeah so I guess the question is how do you approach your fears, you know."
10225.0,Patient,"yeah uh. yeah I yes. And I and i've i've heard. Numerous ideas which makes them. And I still. I still won't. My anxiety comes on so easy if there's any. disruption like like sometimes even when the cat once in. The door, I of course letter in but that that becomes a disruption it causes anxiety. and Now she the pattern is she eats a little bit comes up and lets me patter it's almost as if she's saying thanks for food, then she goes back to eat. And she doesn't ever finish what she's eating, so I I dump out a lot of food and while she's here, there are some things I can't do these are all minor. distractions but they cause me. unreasonable anxiety. So, I suppose, in that case it's changed."
383.0,Provider,"Its is it anxiety, or because anxiety is like irritability I mean insanities it's like it's related to fear."
10225.0,Patient,"Is fear it's it's it's a it's not heavy anxiety, but it is that fear anxiety just getting up you know and and going it's a fear that along the way something's going to go wrong um. I I think now now this what i'm going to tell you, has changed, I most of my life i've had. i've been very intolerant of inanimate things going wrong, something falls off the you know off the table. And I get angry at the object. And so. movement itself is a risk and and sometimes I get very angry now, since this has occurred since since the beginning of the year. Whatever happened to me as occur my tendency towards anger, I am a lot more tolerant. about those things, and that includes driving I I get I get angry a lot less while i'm driving I seem to be able to. To more immediately. look at it from the other drivers point of view, take into account all the possibilities of why something happened, and even if it looks like something malicious driving or otherwise, I see now more tolerance of it my best guess is that it's because. The fear my fear has. Taken precedent. I am I, I have constant fear, because I, because every the few things that I enjoy I don't enjoy anymore, I simply don't enjoy or get joy from anything."
383.0,Provider,yeah that's the fear if we could. you're talking about fear. And and you're talking about anger and that you are gaining more understanding or being more. When you're driving of other people What was it like before when.
10225.0,Patient,"Well before I. I. If someone did it even if someone, even if it was a mistake, even if someone was being negligent I would get angry. At their negligence i'm at at what I perceive up there, negligence."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, we would you curse like curse or something in the car."
10225.0,Patient,I would get I would get. verbally angry. Sometimes quite angry.
383.0,Provider,"How, when you say quite angry, what would that look like before, when you were driving what."
10225.0,Patient,"Well i'd been on the steering wheel sometimes you know I get angry enough to to tailgate gate them or or if they you know or or if they were if I pulled up the side of my traffic light, I give them the finger that that level of anger."
383.0,Provider,How long was that kind of a pattern.
10225.0,Patient,Most I would say. Almost most of my adult life.
383.0,Provider,Okay.
10225.0,Patient,"And that has, and that has changed. it's changed I know i've made an effort to change it, because I don't want to be that way, but I i'm afraid I have to attribute most of that as. i'm i'm i'm more afraid those things don't mean as much to me because I have something that's more prevalent right now, which is fear my whole life and safety and and my future life. What am I going to do with my life. that's that's my best guess, I can still see everything I used to see that made me angry it just doesn't make me as angry, but and and and therefore. And that changed at cowen's you know that coincided with. With me going to the you know go into the to the hospital and then going to the panic and then getting in touch with broad broad heart and getting the right medication."
383.0,Provider,I didn't were there ever any. repercussions of like tailing someone when you are angry or anything like that any any. Like accidents or anything like.
10225.0,Patient,"Throughout the years yeah throughout the years. yeah there was. There was a few times I mean it wasn't always me that. It did that, but I, you know I. I want. You know I want slammed on the brakes and had someone rear end me."
383.0,Provider,Was that intentional.
10225.0,Patient,"It was that was. Going on 30 years ago. But. I don't know. There hasn't there hasn't really that there hasn't been anything yeah. I only think there may have been other close calls or. or. No that's that's about the only one, I could remember. The you know that it was mostly I mean it, they were there were close calls. There were you know I mean they could have they they may may as well have been. Actual collusion, but. But yeah I have, I have come to that point before."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10225.0,Patient,"Now it's it's like I say it. I haven't even come close to that behavior. But i've also you know, through the years i've been making an effort, not to behave that way but it's still the anger came up. But it's. it's it seems to have changed. Quite sudden."
383.0,Provider,"i'm well. Thank you for sharing a little bit about this, these patterns."
10225.0,Patient,By job right now.
383.0,Provider,Where are you at with. Possibly transferring to a higher level of care and what are your thoughts on that.
10225.0,Patient,"I well my thoughts are they are or this and you, you said that you didn't want me to call you until I. Until I called and, as I I did call marine has. A program it's three days or four hours a day. And then I realized, even if. Now, right now, I have medicare and medicaid but, if my medic cat my medical may give up, even if medicare took care of that the cost of that. And this is just this is the superficial part of it, the cost of that would drain me so much that that one one of the things that I have the highest anxiety about which is where i'm going to live would be hindered by how much that would take away, secondly, the description. sounded like. And this is, this is a brief judgment on my part. It says it just didn't sound to me like. I would go anywhere with it it's it's group meetings and then personal meetings and then something else I what i'd like. What ideally, I would like is to and and I don't know how to go about this plus I reluctant to go about it. As i've told you about the reluctance, but. I would like to have someone who was was, I guess, a specialist in in targeting. My particular problem. and see the specialist and not. Not necessarily also attend that the group meeting, but like I say, and they may be beneficial, but I. I really in long run, it would cause anxiety because. I don't you know. That it may, it may. It may make it not possible for me to find a decent way of living a decent place to live and. So those are Those are two things if it were just one or the other. I might say. i'll try it. Anyway, anyway, America those. Those are the reasons I go ahead."
383.0,Provider,"And so, this is the it says mirin through marine general hospital or what."
10225.0,Patient,"yo, no, no, no, let me, let me see if I can find the name. hold on. I don't know if I bro. No that's the clinics hold on i'm also I haven't I still don't have a primary doctor and i'm just I just went onto the web. Last week to look that up and at that I should have done that. A year ago, let me see. If I can find. What I was looking. i'm sorry I thought I had. it's it's marine county mental health. illness that I I hope i'm right about this. yeah there's the crisis. Okay it's okay it's Marin county mental health services."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, thank you for clarifying."
10225.0,Patient,yeah sorry sorry took so.
383.0,Provider,"well. I think that. I don't know about the insurance piece, but I doubt through a county agency that. You will be paying out of pocket."
10225.0,Patient,"well. If I lose my medic cow, I will and they might want i've been using medical and I don't qualify I I hired someone to to let them know that you know that I am beyond that that my my. assets are beyond their qualification, we still haven't heard back that we heard back from them as an acknowledgement but. If that if one day comes at it i'm still using i've been using Meta cow they may want. some or all of that money back that they've been supplement. that's the problem and if that's the case if. It makes it harder for me to. To find a place that I can. I dread I dread moving anyway, but. I certainly dread moving to a place that I. That I would hate."
383.0,Provider,"yeah so. Just back to the topic of. and higher level of care and this three day a week intensive it sounds like I said, like an intensive outpatient or program where you you go in the mornings are they on zoom the calls are."
10225.0,Patient,"No, this is, this is an actual i'd actually be going that part of it, I like because I would be you know interacting. It three days a week. From 11. To two. And that's not bad, either, but it's that's nine hours a week, and so it's it's I I forgot exactly what she she described but. You see, you see. People one on one and you go to."
383.0,Provider,All right. Did you set up an intake appointment with the person that you spoke with.
10225.0,Patient,"about all. This on diarization. No, no."
383.0,Provider,"Because they do need to have those evaluations. Oh, except you."
10225.0,Patient,"Oh, I know I know if I were if I were going to do it, I would ask, I would see how much I can how much paperwork, I could fill out before even you know over the Web before, but no I didn't because the other issues came up, and so I didn't go any further."
383.0,Provider,"mm hmm So what do you think about what do you, what is your plan or what do you think about. Your mental health care."
10225.0,Patient,well. Staying with with. Staying with bright heart.
383.0,Provider,Okay. And you know if if if our evaluation is that you need more services. Which is has been something we've been discussing and with chantel as well. Do you feel like you would like more help to kind of fair it out other resources in your area or.
10225.0,Patient,"Right now i'd like to see all for get with the way I am with the way things are going, if I get if I get down to where I was when I first started seeing you then. Then i'll i'll just know that. That it. goes it can phase back into that point i'm really trying to keep it where it is. because unfortunately the the. You know, like I say the very cost of take care of the problem, which is the most important causes is part of what causes the anxiety and."
383.0,Provider,"Right, but sometimes that's you know that's a. You may not be 100%. Knowing all the hard facts regarding that. know, especially if you have. You know, with medical I mean they do, they do a lot certain amount of money, you can use, for you know rent and other things."
10225.0,Patient,"But I not see i'm not indigent I have, I have quite I have enough assets to buy a house and invest and and maybe support on that what I don't have his job or any qualifications."
383.0,Provider,"Well, to be on medical you can own a house, you can own a house to be on medical if you don't you know but i'm not the insurance specialist, but I just."
10225.0,Patient,know I always thought right knowing you know it's not it's not. My medical is is imperil already that's that's not what i'm worried about i'm worried about the the the money that they may want back makes makes it harder for me. Money wise to find a place that that is decent decent enough to live that I didn't you know not I mean. Not.
383.0,Provider,So i'm under so what i'm getting here is that there's financial concerns with.
10225.0,Patient,"You and that and that would cause and the extra cost would cause anxiety because that that threatens more that that that serves as more of a threat to my to my being able to live halfway decently and I don't want I don't want to live in a slum I don't want to live. At base, if I could possibly help."
383.0,Provider,"Well i'm concerned, you know i'm not a case manager, and here I mean i've done that, before where it's like okay let's look at where you can live been your mental health status and different things and that's not my role really here in this position. I understand they're all those concerns and those go into the part into your mental health status, you know, stable, housing and managing your resources and things like that. It i'm glad you're doing better, you said you feel like you're doing some better you are working on you're putting some effort in some direction you know certain directions. And there's some improvement that you're noting, which is good it's. You know your scores of your surveys, are a little improved from when you first came in."
10225.0,Patient,So that's yeah yeah.
383.0,Provider,"hi they're still pretty high, but."
10225.0,Patient,"Well, they. yeah in in in some of the questions, most of them, unfortunately, that the ones that are direct like. Do you feel anxiety that those are every day but yeah a few of them I I noted. Our school scoring higher but it's not much, I mean it's it's still that the big stuff is still done."
383.0,Provider,And so that's why it would seem that for. Having some kind of significant increase in treatment some kind of significant change and what you're getting for your mental health could make some marked improvement.
10225.0,Patient,You know.
383.0,Provider,Rather than being home isolated and then just you know getting on a call now and then.
10225.0,Patient,"You know, and you know just just fyi so you know, because this, this would be in your in your ballpark I do talk to my mother. More these days."
383.0,Provider,"Well, well okay. Well that's, what do you feel like that's an improvement."
10225.0,Patient,"Well yeah I I don't know I don't know my mother, unfortunately, is. she's. she's starting to show signs of. yeah I guess I don't want I."
383.0,Provider,"I don't know enough to have dementia, but she's."
10225.0,Patient,"You know she's her absent minded, this is increasing and. uh but, but I do we still we still talk a long time, usually, when we talk, we talk over an hour. And I talked to her. I talked to her probably an average down once a week, if not more. and part of that is because she's. You know she's she's 91 and. anyway. that's another stress. I don't know. there's a there's a number of things that are pending all the time that. I don't of course don't want to deal with, but sometimes can't deal with. And I preempt them I think they haven't happened yet i'm i'm. Anticipating. And I have to, I have to at least stop doing that because. Because there's no, you know they may be coming up, I just don't have. If I if I do any planning for him, I have to think about them that's one the anxiety."
383.0,Provider,"Well, there are things that. need to get accomplished in life that are not easy and. You know, we are, we may feel anxiety. Managing those things and we can still take deep breaths and take you know one thing at a time and."
10225.0,Patient,"And that's what i'm going for but you know you say there are things we have to do that aren't easy problem is that the the anxieties. Even last season. And it. It. Sometimes tends to freeze well it freezes it. But you know. You jumped back to another subject that the fact that I can't enjoy anything I think is significant to. The because you have to. Most people do things because they have. A value in doing it, and I just don't. enjoy anything to do. And so there's there's nothing to do. That I even want to do. And so I am. I really. Some days I feel like i'm just existing. And it's all you know it's it's Sometimes I feel like i'm in i'm in a position that. geriatric people who are. we're finally at the point of being bedroom. Or at and and yet i'm 57 and. Pretty healthy. Except for. Except for the is this, this is fear. sadness and. Well, the fear and sadness. seems to freeze."
383.0,Provider,"well. These are, these are conditions that you been. Expressing since the beginning of since i've started seeing you on. And you've tried different medications you're working still working with sentelle regarding the medication."
10225.0,Patient,We found we saw i'm certainly found a better balance that I had for i'm sorry I interrupt you. i'm bad at that.
383.0,Provider,"yeah I mean that's why I think that you know. If we do something different, we may feel different if we do something different, we may feel different. If we think something different, we may feel different totally. I guess differently, is the proper English but, but if we think the same things in the same way, then we will likely feel the same, and if we do the same things we will likely feel the same. And we're not asked you know it's like i'm not suggesting you, you know, have a radical change in what you do and think, but start with the small changes, some one small change that you could do you know and one within your thinking and in your behaving and your in your actions. yeah see if you will correspondingly feel something different. But. The cornerstone is our relationship with ourselves, so if your relationship with yourself if we have self loathing if we have guilt if we have remorse if we have regret. we're still going we have those things were carrying around we're going to need to. Take those things apart and because if you if you are full of self loathing or you've rejected yourself on a deep level, then. Or you have deep disappointment about yourself it doesn't really matter if you make pancakes or you know or or how salmon for dessert you're still going to feel you're not going to feel good so."
10225.0,Patient,"Is it Okay, if I ask. you a question. sure those those things, some of those things you mentioned, we we didn't discuss do you feel that those are. Those are part of. The problem, the self loading the Gill."
383.0,Provider,"I don't know, I was just suggesting, because I do you do express you know the disappointment and. Then, how you, you know what you've done in the past, or how you've been or something you know."

383.0,Provider,Good.
10225.0,Patient,"Okay, all right."
383.0,Provider,What are you going to what we're going to say.
10225.0,Patient,"No, I was just it's it's I can't I can't remember you, you mentioned a few things which. See, I feel I feel empty I feel like it's nothing's I don't feel like something's pushing me away from getting anything out of life, I feel empty like like I you know, like. Like i'm missing a some kind of nutrient that hasn't yet you know, a proverbial nutrient that makes me. feel."
383.0,Provider,You don't you. You feel like you don't feel.
10225.0,Patient,"Well, except except I can feel fear. And you know. So obviously I could feel. But It just seems like it's either fear or or dad. or nothing. Now that's now that's intermittent with. I can still. I can still go slightly up and down with things I like or don't like but they don't mean enough to doing."
383.0,Provider,"mm hmm. well. that's where. You know you, we must push ourselves, you know I mean if there's someone that tells me i'm indifferent toward. i'm indifferent toward other people Maybe someone to tell me that i'm in different toward other people. Well, I mean, I guess, my response would not be well okay that's how you that's how you are in different different other people, I would encourage them to to to see if they can make if they can. stir some something inside themselves to feel something different, besides indifference, you know."
10225.0,Patient,"I understand look, can I got to add that it's it's it with people it's a little more than in different so you know I have is I have somewhat of a repulsion to most people so there's you know they're there. Okay, anyway, just want to let you know."
383.0,Provider,"Well, I was using as an example, but i'm glad that you told me that that you actually feel some repulsing that is a feeling."

I don't want to have the bullshit gets people I don't see why I propulsion I don't have any. logic, I can give you why have repulsion. I can point out little things that. seemed to bug me but."
383.0,Provider,"Right, but what can you do to change that emotion is the question. Because that's a negative emotion and that will eventually result in negative actions. And so what can you do to stir more more affection toward. Others are more passion and I think what you said that you're doing in your car when you notice Oh, I understand why that person made a mistake, or maybe they're driving slow, because they don't know the area, or whatever you can do to. stir you know compassion or understanding toward others."
10225.0,Patient,"And yeah and and and indeed the you know the the the other people, I know, on zoom the other meetings that the whole the whole doctrine is around that. The primary one of the primary. edicts is. Finding you know, seeing. The love in what what they call your brother they call everybody your brother he which includes everybody men and women. But finding the love and and that's that's that's a necessity and it's something I want to break through, but sometimes it's something I also I can't see through the Shell of people. I mean I. I can but but that's the see that you know I it's the Shell is too I react too much to the Shell, if I could see through the shell. I would have a better."
383.0,Provider,"Well that's good that you're aware that you see that that's your pattern we're going to need to conclude, and I still do encourage you to do a little bit more research to see if maybe that program would work for you."
