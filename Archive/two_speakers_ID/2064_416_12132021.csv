You know, because. He scared you know and so it's like and then might have my son stay empty you what you're saying to me it's like you're not helping her mom just get a restraining order you know and. it's hard it's so hard because it's like. You know I can't I can't see the other baby, because over all of a sudden, she wants to baby in her life. it's like where were you 910 months ago, all the sudden nine or 10 months ago you expect everybody to bend over and do what you want, because you decide you're down here, no that isn't the way it works."
416.0,Provider,"So i'm on the same page with you about all of this i'm totally in agreement, and I can hear your frustration. Your anger. you're hurt all of this is true what is difficult to understand is that none of this is enough for you to say enough is enough."
2064.0,Patient,"yeah and it it's hard, I mean I don't know I don't want her. They get a restraining order, I mean I want her to stay out and Nicole I want her to know it feels like I had to you know. And like I told her what made me get clean was you took off and I decided to stay with your baby's Daddy Stanley and I fell in love with your son your son helped me. You know I love in even I wasn't the mom my grandma giving him that, reading to him at nighttime you know we we were close. You know, and she even cried one day her fillers came out and she said mom. He chased me, and I still walked away from him, and she started crying while filling star coming up, so what she had to do, she had to go get loaded because she couldn't handle it. Like you need to let these feelings come come out, you know or so made me feel guilty, you know, like used in till for guinea pig and I didn't I mean that that was the case today. will still. Be here with."
416.0,Provider,Fred harbor statement she'll make you feel guilty.
2064.0,Patient,"Yes, and that's why I called her I said you're using everything it's an excuse to get high and it's not it's not working with me I. I played this game before i'm not playing them no more i'm not so done she walked out the door and I text her and I told her i'd gone to my sister's a lot lower but you know it's like."
416.0,Provider,When are you gonna let her back in later on tonight when she comes home because she's going to.
2064.0,Patient,"she's going to come down, no. i'm not going to that she broke my damn window, I mean letter go and she's able to get into my vehicle I mean I don't know how to lock the back of the vehicle. To keep her it doesn't run or anything but still, you know that that vehicle is not only in my name is to my brother's name too. So he came to have her arrested for trespassing not with his vehicle you know so it's like and she's not supposed to be or my landlord taught me she does not want her here. I mean so i'm going to get kicked out because of her oh. That I didn't me the other day. I don't like to get angry i'm not an angry person and she had me so mad. That my sister had to grab me because I was going to go over there and I was going to grab her and that isn't the way a mother and a daughter should be. That is not the way it should be, you know everything's funny to her hi it's not funny To me, this is not funny you go outside and a towel dancing around you're 30 years old you're making a complete jackass out of yourself and me. You know. Oh."
416.0,Provider,"So. Today, what are you going to. When are you you're going to let her in tomorrow or the next day, I think we might need to do a little bit of codependency we're."
2064.0,Patient,"not leaving. You know, once I get. My medicine. i'll be okay it's like i'm on that weekly basis and it's hard to get medication from. One farms, he wants to control substance to another, so this is something so. she's just she's gonna think i'm at my sister's house. And you know. SDN light there and do. The other day I had in the bathroom with the door shut. I mean."
416.0,Provider,"But you shouldn't have gotten your own not to wait why what's preventing you from locking the door telling her she's not coming in getting. Training order and calling the police, when she comes there what's keeping you from doing that because you shouldn't have to be displaced from your own house, I feel like i'm a prisoner my own home."
2064.0,Patient,"You know, and the thing is is and my dog like I said I feel so sorry for him, because he is just like. he sees need to scours dogs not scour he's not."
416.0,Provider,"Right so with that sheila what's keeping you from staying in your own place putting a firm boundary she's not coming she's not getting in the door. She tries to break in from the window i'm calling the police, if she tries to pound down my door i'm calling the police getting the restraining order what's keeping you from doing that."
2064.0,Patient,"Because. I love her. I mean I don't know I just. I don't want to have to do that, I want to hurt again."
416.0,Provider,"But it's Either that, or you hide in the bathroom or you go pretend to be at your sister sounds. yeah I mean that doesn't work either none of us. on the line."
2064.0,Patient,And it.
416.0,Provider,Like.
2064.0,Patient,"It costs $125. To get a restraining order. I have to pay for guy I felt most of it out and. You know I always like to do is just go go do it, I mean. You know I need to make the biggest issue around but i'm trying to get her house. Back to again worth it it's not hurt I already have a bad adult and that's it nothing there's nothing doesn't care about nothing."
416.0,Provider,"yeah well also she's not going to get any help and tell she's made to she has, I mean, I said that wrong until she's pushed so far that she decides to do it."
2064.0,Patient,But if he wasn't.
416.0,Provider,Losing babies hasn't done it losing her family hasn't done it I don't know what will.
2064.0,Patient,"yeah I mean. She has hit. rock bottom to a lot of people different than others. Okay, and. Her rock bottom I don't know what it's going to be, I mean I could end up losing my daughter to death, I mean, and I think that's what scares me the most. is losing. We love her you know. And then I have my neighbor call my landlord saying that. Jennifer mentioned expensive I there's no way Jennifer she's. Just selfish to even think about committing suicide, you know and. My brother's coming over here later, and you know if I make it through today I think i'm gonna have to David restraining order and it's like, if you want to come in you're going to have to I just told her all you have to do is not use a day with wi fi together, I mean. I wouldn't be with my daughter, I want to have relationship with my daughter, but that's not my daughter, that is. A demon I mean I don't mean that that sounds terrible but she is she's. So mean I and i'm scared ever. I mean that's the worst he broke my back already I mean so. You don't know what she's gonna do. You know, and like I said she broke the window because she didn't get this is this is do not behavior. Oh, I mean this does one go back gel that she's been gone the person is done quicker ways I mean or she can that."
416.0,Provider,That might be the best place for her for.
2064.0,Patient,"When she's in jail, I know she say. I mean, I know a lot of time to Scott aloe gel she's tired and hell, they use there too, but you know that's their problem, not mine they're going to have put up with her air. But you know I shouldn't have to fill up with it, I don't want it, I don't want it around me, I cannot stand that shit I mean. I had been able to go to meetings I haven't nothing you know we we made an agreement on me going to meetings and I just don't trust her at my house by herself, I mean."
416.0,Provider,"down, but he doesn't have a key right."
2064.0,Patient,No she doesn't.
416.0,Provider,So why can't you go to a meeting and lock the doors and windows and everything so she can't get in.
2064.0,Patient,"Oh man she to get a bang and then my dog can be barking and. We know that I could always try to find the made watch chain, I mean my neighbors she's around watch him. Not the one next door, the one next door. she's probably the worst of the worst she she's crying for help, she doing this know Jane you don't know her you know, while she didn't. You know, some we've all had our missy we've all had our problems I you know I I lost my parents, Nigeria and my brother committed suicide. You know I lost the grandson I lost the grandbaby that I raised, you know, I have a daughter who's an addict this running into a brick wall, we all have problems. will be honest, I had choices to get help you know and so i'm looking for someplace else to MU by I need to move out these apartment complexes because, like I said she doesn't help at all, I mean. That and like I said she let her go in there, the other day, I will let her go in there, and she can she can have for a while Oh, but I told her watch a shake she'll still for me everything I had in the lockbox."
416.0,Provider,"Okay. I mean, are you ready to make a plan or take some steps, I know you feel really lost and stuck there are a lot more ready to help you your brothers there your son's there you've got some neighbors your landlords on board with this here right."
2064.0,Patient,"yeah I mean everybody agrees with me it agrees with you guys and it's like. Like getting a restraining order like Tom my daughter to she's already had one against her with me and the baby anyway. Because of you know it wasn't brought on by me, it was bothered by the courts, because she attacked me and then I was holding the baby and she hit my shoulder, and it was bleeding and across asked me what happened and I told them so she got a child endangerment and she she got. restraining order against us anyway, so I know it's not going to be a big deal, but just bird knows. what's going, you know he knows how she is I mean and so it's just my my decision on. I don't think she's gonna hate me, I hope, in the long run, he asked to realize that i'm just sick and tired of living in hell. I shouldn't have to live in hell I shouldn't have to worry about locking myself in my bedroom at night or locking myself in the bathroom and smoking, I do not smoke my house. And I had smoking in my bed my bathroom blowing frickin cigarette smoke and the freakin Basel and twisting the frickin lid on it, I mean that's crazy that is total craziness. I mean this she has no respect she's just gonna walk around smoke smoke not only cigarettes that caught my house I can't stand the smell thought, and you know she tells me oh I i'm not bullshit you say I could smell the damn shit you know and it's like just all just. you're crazy and the thing is is I i'm allowing it that's what Dom it's like. it's hard, really, really hard, I mean if I when I worked with other people was so much easier to help other people, because it wasn't my kit. You know and that's why I keep telling people I I bring me any video over I help them get claim because i'm more stern because they're not like it. But i'm phrase she's gonna come between me and my son I don't want that, again I don't i'm finally got a relationship on with him and I don't. The kids that are asking for me it, you know so. And I don't get to see the other baby, because you know that. They have my nephew has the baby in a kid they're afraid to you know they're afraid that she's gonna come into the House or whatever you don't know or you know, and I told her. That baby's not. Yours anymore, I mean that baby that's that's their their mommy and Daddy they change name I don't like it, you know but. they're raising her I want never call her ella I will call her baby girl that I will not call her ella I don't like the name.
