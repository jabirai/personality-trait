498.0,Provider,"Okay okay so maybe next week, in addition to anything else that you feel comfortable talking about with the therapist let her know. Just some areas that you would like to improve in if it's you know, focusing on tasks or communication or any one area so that you guys can formulate a plan outside of drug therapy to work on those areas okay. Okay, and then. In addition to seeing you in group go ahead do me a favor and go ahead now and schedule a follow up appointment with me for. Early to mid January, just so that I can keep up with how. Efficient therapy is going for you, just in case we need to make any changes to medications but I really think that just engaging in some task management and. incorporation of integration of some skills could greatly improved like the areas that you're looking to focus on because you've already indicated that. The medication you're sleeping while you're eating while your mood is improved it's still just kind of. The area of attention and focus and concentration that you'd like to work on you guys could work on skills that can help help improve memory help improve attention span help improve the ability to focus and then that in itself will also improve your mode okay."
