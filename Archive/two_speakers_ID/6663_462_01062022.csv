462.0,Provider,hi Aaron how are you.
6663.0,Patient,been better.
462.0,Provider,yeah what's going on.
6663.0,Patient,"Doctors appointment. 27. and Then blood work. And he scheduled me out for. Too much and. Monday I got a phone call saying that on. That he needed me to come in, within two weeks go over the bloodwork. And I don't know what to think about it that you got my anxiety."
462.0,Provider,"Right Okay, so you haven't you don't know yet what's happening, he just told you to come back in."
6663.0,Patient,"yeah usually like. Usually, with my doctor he. Like would tell me, you know it says that over the phone or he would wait till the next appointment so it's got me like word."
462.0,Provider,yeah why understandable when it when is the next appointment now.
6663.0,Patient,January 12.
462.0,Provider,"Okay alright, so you have one week basically. anxieties high understandably. So how do you think you can best get through this one week."
6663.0,Patient,to know a. comeback. You guys don't get emails over.
462.0,Provider,"Your blood work. yeah i'm not I don't think so. No, it was a little unless it was a lab done for us which here, I can. See if."
6663.0,Patient,"They asked me about my blood work. Because I had to sign something for to be sent you guys. This is, this is just driving me crazy. But."
462.0,Provider,what's your biggest fear here what's the underlying fear.
6663.0,Patient,something bad.
462.0,Provider,Okay.
6663.0,Patient,Like.
462.0,Provider,"Is there something specific that you're afraid of, or just a bad diagnosis and general."
6663.0,Patient,"Bad diagnosis one thing can stick out in my mind I guess. Okay. um. I don't know like before I did my blood work i've been fail on like down a little bit kind of like tired. And when I go to bed and it's just weird because. Like. um I don't know if your body knows that there's something wrong. But like. Before I did my blood work I used to lay in bed thinking that something. Like I don't know, I guess, think of death. You know not like suicide or anything like that."
462.0,Provider,"You just think that it could be. The next step well here's the thing my blood work. mm hmm you have anxiety right so with this is a diagnosis that you have, in general, so you can just first come back to the notion that. This is your mind just kind of trying to play tricks on you a little bit trying to make things as hard for you as possible and just remember that and then. know that there's so many ways this could go you could be anemic and that it could be as simple as you need to take some iron supplements right or. It could be something more, and they just need to teach you how to treat it or ask a question about your lifestyle, or something like that right, it could be very simple. likely they were life and death. They would get you in as soon as possible and not make you wait around so. yeah definitely you're going to be living. They would they believe that you'll be alive at least till next week so that's one thing you can remind yourself of is they wouldn't book you a week or two weeks out if they didn't think you were going to be able to live through it."
6663.0,Patient,"She was such a thing, because they booked me like his first appoint me at open."
462.0,Provider,"But again, if they thought that it was going to be death in between they they would have to find a way to send you to the er or do something else so. The good news is that they believe you'll be able to get through this, at least until you get there to just discuss what's going on right, I know. That this is really. scary for you it's understandable your fears are valid, but you also just need to remind yourself that you do have anxiety which is trying to send you to the worst place possible. And that the doctors wouldn't just leave you out here alone if they thought that this was so serious that you could die within a week okay so there's important just to kind of bring it around to those two factors and then just. Think a couple things number one, how can you cope with this, how can you lower your anxiety what works for you, I mean we talk about a lot in group I know for you being busy working with your goats all of that helps your anxiety reduce. you've been able to do stuff like that."
6663.0,Patient,I still do it look like my anxiety is out of control. Different level.
462.0,Provider,"Have you called the doctor's office back at all and and just double check to see if there's another sooner appointment, or just let them know that you're really."
6663.0,Patient,"Really scared Oh, I wanted to come back and tell them the email when my results. But. I could be something. You know i'm not good with that stuff I you know I mean I wanted to go down there to be true for there and just say hey can you give me my results I don't need an appointment."
462.0,Provider,"I mean you could call them and let them know that you're panicking and is there any way that they can get you in sooner. or share something with you right or, if you could just. Speak to the doctor on the phone at some point before then that might be worth doing right sometimes they have to have you in person I don't know but it's worth calling and let them know that you have anxiety and it's putting you into a state of panic."
6663.0,Patient,Definitely.
462.0,Provider,"That could be a just immediate step of just calling and saying hey. This is what's going on, I have an appointment in a week i'm panicking is there anything you can do for me to support me."
6663.0,Patient,"You can just call you know what I mean. it's not even just you know. I can read my lab works mate maybe they can tell me, you know I don't know that stuff but in the meantime I just fighting this demon."
462.0,Provider,yeah it's it's really hard. it's really scary so.
6663.0,Patient,"just say never done i've just never dealt with this, you know what I mean. Like last time and cholesterol is a little high. Two three months, and then I had an appointment and then we went over it, you know and then this is like boom I get a phone call saying the doctor needs to discuss your blood work."
462.0,Provider,yeah.
6663.0,Patient,"really got me like. got me like thinking you know. Okay, so he's got to discuss it, but they won't tell me, you know they didn't tell me over the phone or. Whatever whatever you know if it was a lion that say. You know, you need to invite him in or something or whatever you know what I mean and. So that's that's and then and then. I before that, when I was laying in bed I just thought that there was something wrong with me and I haven't had this anxiety with I think you know there's something wrong with me I haven't had this, this has been matured this has been under control and all of a sudden, like. I just started getting these weird feelings and weird gut feelings and started thinking about it i'm just out of the blue, I started getting closer with my kids. And that's what scares me."
462.0,Provider,yeah the anxiety is really just getting the best of you right now.
6663.0,Patient,"yeah, and this is before like my blood work, this is even before my doctor's appointment, you know and."
462.0,Provider,See you're trying to read into everything and find.
6663.0,Patient,"him just one. Is is there a reason why this is happening, and then I get a call that need to go over this i'll give you the biggest reason, all that can come to my head is for some reason cancer."
462.0,Provider,yeah. Can cancer be detected through just blood work.
6663.0,Patient,I mean. I don't know no.
462.0,Provider,yeah well. Of course that's the absolute worst case scenario right that there's cancer and the picture.
6663.0,Patient,"yeah I try going over better things you know. Maybe it's just something my cholesterol my you know I had to shake. When I was there. They gave me something to eat, you know. I don't know what they call it, but they said, my sugar I could be something. lot."
462.0,Provider,"mm hmm you're the job of anxiety its function here is to bring you to the worst case scenario and think make you convince you. That that's the case so you're living in this state of fear you really just have to keep bringing yourself back to the present moment right you don't have a confirmation. Right now, so you just have to remind yourself, you don't as of right now, you, you have not been told that you have cancer, I want to remind you of that even though your mind is. Bringing you there. Were into note and then just also think about other ways to work through this so number one. call the doctor's Office, let them know you're in a panic, let them know you're thinking you have you know the worst case scenario, you have anxiety disorder anyway see if there's any way to get in sooner speak on the phone something right. Or if they get easier mind in some way. And then."
6663.0,Patient,"Just simple, as you know, it's not as bad as like a thing you know it's not a matter of life and death it's just something that we have caught on that we get to get it under control before. You know what I mean right and."
462.0,Provider,"So that would be a good start that's a good start you've got one thing you can do i'm sure, maybe they're closed for today it's later on the east coast, but maybe first thing tomorrow you're one of the first callers there, and you can just try to talk to someone."
6663.0,Patient,"I wanted to, but then like a consultant in you guys first you know what I mean."
462.0,Provider,"That was a good choice, because this is, more than anything, right now, it's your anxiety disorder just spinning you in in in circles it's valid because that's a scary situation, but again, you don't have any conclusions yet."
6663.0,Patient,"No, no. No, I mean not at all I just I know I know it's my anxiety I. mean knock on wood that you know it's not as bobo as it without bus seems or sounds because to me it's going to be."
462.0,Provider,Right.
6663.0,Patient,"And I get that but it's control and that's that's you know, most of the time I can control it, I can keep it under control. Right."
462.0,Provider,yeah. So it's just a little bit of.
6663.0,Patient,"My anxiety. If you go back some of the stuff we talked about my anxieties about my health. that's what my anxiety is about and then boom you get to call and then boom, you know where that's going. I know where it's going I knew where it's going the minute that they call me, you know what I mean I see Dr McDonald pop right up and. I mean, I know you know there's things that I can load I know it's not a failed drug test them I don't do drugs, you know what I mean so. I know the right. Right, you know i'm. Here and. So I know that you know so, then you just start thinking and thinking and thinking and thinking and thinking and thinking right."
462.0,Provider,you're starting to think of any possible scenario again anything and of. course the worst cases. Cancer for anybody.
6663.0,Patient,"I tried to make it. I tried to make it. stop worrying, and you know everything's gonna be fine, it can be a little a string and then all of a sudden your mind gets. Going which is anxiety and. Talk to right out of it now, and you know. What if it isn't bad."
462.0,Provider,it's.
6663.0,Patient,"Just and cost my anxieties my help my anxieties right kind of death, you know I think we've talked about that fear death."
462.0,Provider,"Absolutely yeah so it's understandable that this would be a really, really big trigger for you. So it's literally. it's just so important to keep bringing yourself back around to the reality that you haven't been diagnosed with anything you can't predict the future. What you can do is practice your coping skills so working with your goats deep breathing will help the physical symptoms, because it'll let your body know that you're safe."
6663.0,Patient,"I can honestly tell you that these last couple days as I found out. i've literally tried keeping my boat self so busy. not think about it, you know what I mean, because I know that's what it's going to take that's what it's going to take for me. To not think about it it's the downtime. known and that sounds terrible in itself."
462.0,Provider,Trying to keep busy that all time all day.
6663.0,Patient,I can't stay busy 24 seven on.
462.0,Provider,Human you know what I mean no.
6663.0,Patient,downtime when I wake up in the morning boom there it goes it's triggered.
462.0,Provider,"And then, have you told your partner about this."
6663.0,Patient,Absolutely.
462.0,Provider,And what does she say.
6663.0,Patient,"um I think. You know that. I think she feels that the I don't. know she she coaches me through it and says, well, maybe not that bad you know. Right and then I told her about everything and that's not me that's not meal thinking about you know laying in bed he when I told her that it kind of headers you're gonna cry. Because that's not Nice."
462.0,Provider,she's getting scared to yeah.
6663.0,Patient,"Absolutely, and she don't have anxiety and she. She knows me, you know, it was the way I was talking that you know triggered her off and. And I don't know I don't I don't know if she like. thinks that there's something wrong because she. I don't know what you're thinking on me. um but I know that. Like she's been more sensitive to me the stuff like that's good for me. And stuff. yeah who's noticed the difference. With me China spend more time on my kids before. You know what I mean. She she said, and I asked her I said does your body, knowing something's wrong i'm pretty she she's really supportive of my anxiety and know. You know and. she's like down on my adopt I don't know, but sometimes your body knows before you know."
462.0,Provider,"I don't. We don't you don't over and that's important to keep reminding both of you right, so the social support from her is helpful like you said she's always been supportive of your anxiety and so. Just it helps to have someone so just sit next to her right sometimes holding someone's hand or give having a hug can be really comforting. And then just. Almost kind of. Fast forward a little bit so part of this anxiety is just not knowing it's. Not knowing right so when you get the answer which is. going to be soon might feel like forever right now you'll have an answer, and with that answer you'll have medical support whatever it is right, so part of it right now is just not knowing and just know that this time will pass and you might just have to do your best to. Go get through this time. To cope with it right, but just knowing that it will pass and. When you get the answer, even if it's not a good one, you have an answer, and you have a plan, so there is some sense of control, right now, it just feels very out of control, because you, you have no idea, they gave you enough and they're making you wait two weeks. And that's really hard."
6663.0,Patient,"Absolutely absolutely i'm like. Like blindfolded I feel hopeless, you know I feel blindfolded."
462.0,Provider,yeah right into this doctor's office and.
6663.0,Patient,I could be hit with a great big. reality check or it could be. You fool I was so worried.
462.0,Provider,"Right yeah exactly either way, though you'll have an answer and you'll be with a doctor who can. support you and help you plan."
6663.0,Patient,"Absolutely, and it was just like you know. There was getting to the point where I had to reach out, I had to reach out to Santo to talk, you know. Brian to ask me about my therapist and about you and what my appointments were, and of course everything's Oh, you know what hold after the result."
462.0,Provider,"yeah it is but that's why we're here, I like I said I we brought your frequency down to make your life less stressful but, if something like this pops up, you can always reach out and ask for you know, a pop in appointment like today."
6663.0,Patient,"yeah that's I mean it was like. Oh no i'm just hoping, maybe talking about it, like. You know, sometimes talking about it with somebody different that knows what's going on. And you know, maybe how."
462.0,Provider,"Do you D, so you had your medicated for your anxiety is there any way she can up your dose for a week or something like that."
6663.0,Patient,I don't know. I believe that completely up you know I I come to groups I just tried to tell you guys how i'm doing and and I leave that to the experts i'm on nuts.
462.0,Provider,"I would. ask her and say you've got an intensely stressful week, did you tell her what's going on via email or."
6663.0,Patient,Talk to her so like I tell everybody everything I would.
462.0,Provider,"concur say you've gotta wait this out, is there any way to increase your medication dosage temporarily or something she can give you to get through this or recommendations."
6663.0,Patient,I mean.
462.0,Provider,I think there's a medication.
6663.0,Patient,I made it point blank would you guys I don't I don't lie about nothing you know I that's.
462.0,Provider,An honest.
6663.0,Patient,"I gotta be straightforward, so you guys can diagnose me right."
462.0,Provider,"mm hmm and i'm medication is not my. Expertise that's hers, but I do know that sometimes, depending on the case, there can be a temporary increase in dosage or something else that could be given to get through a crisis."
6663.0,Patient,don't even know how to go about doing it.
462.0,Provider,I would email her and just say.
6663.0,Patient,i'm not that person because. I know there's people they're trying to get them medicine increased you know what I mean. The I don't I don't I don't like to ask.
462.0,Provider,"Well, what to ask for. step away from that let let other people do what they do and know that you've been our patient for a really long time and if she's unable to increase it she'll say she's unable, if she can she will right, so I would step away from the other people or the. The stigma or anything behind it."
6663.0,Patient,"pride, more than anything."
462.0,Provider,Right. So maybe right now is a good time to just step away from the private and ask for help and see if there's anything she can do for. For you.
6663.0,Patient,"yeah. i'll send her an email and just say. Go I say that we talk and then we should get valid that we brought up that if you know, is there any way that I can do something temporarily for relief of my anxiety. While this is going on. I don't know."
462.0,Provider,"yeah that's. A great exactly what you can ask her. So that's the plan that's a step, something you can control another thing you can control, as we said is tomorrow morning I would maybe look out for if you already know what time the doctor's office opens and try to be."
6663.0,Patient,One of the $4 I know exactly one trust me.
462.0,Provider,"yeah and try to be one of the first callers of the day, and just tell them point blank like you said honesty is something you've always been with us so you can be honest with that my anxiety disorder. I was given you know I took my labs I was told to come in and two weeks and it's putting me in a state of crisis and panic is there anything you can do."
6663.0,Patient,"yeah I will call them tomorrow um and I will contact. chantelle to see. If we can just temporarily do something to help users anxiety I don't even know like it's no panic. yeah no I mean I teach more panic I have both of them I don't know I don't know if you got my original diagnosis. But like when it first started it was severe panic attacks. anxiety that led into severe panic attacks, which probably goes hand in hand. I don't know. i'm not i'm not a medical person I just know that for the you know, sometimes it gets to the point where we just think you're dying. So, but I guess I guess that's that's my goal bath to talk to them a deal as a contraction to. ask her if there's a temporary relief on. Their situation. And I will contact my doctors tomorrow morning to see if there's any way that. Somebody can call me to ease me. On the results of my bloodwork. mm hmm that I had a chance to be anxiety and. it's making it. Like impossible well I can't say impossible, but had to live with."
462.0,Provider,It that's a great thing to tell them right it's making it tough for you to live day to day it's put you in a crisis in a panic. And then another thing and I don't know this would be something to just look into is an urgent care if there's any urgent cares if if they say there's nothing we can do we can't tell you. Anything you just have my blood done say hey I need to go jump around with me. I mean if you feel like you truly can't make it until what is it 567 14 or something like that yeah. So you're. you're at this point where they can't do anything for you at the doctor's office and you truly cannot make it through this week.
6663.0,Patient,Trust me i've already done is.
462.0,Provider,i've already thought it's.
6663.0,Patient,"It is an option, I want to go to."
462.0,Provider,Urgent care. Possibly look into an urge.
6663.0,Patient,To you guys because. It was at the point where I will go to the emergency room to find out what's wrong with me.
462.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6663.0,Patient,"Well, we can but I know that I know my anxiety because that's what I used to do so, the right thing to do is call call my psychiatrist might their therapist. To reach out and say hey this is going on."
462.0,Provider,"Now you're doing a great job managing your anxiety, by taking it, step by step, instead of just dashing off to the emergency room right here talking."
6663.0,Patient,To.
462.0,Provider,"Getting some support the step that you can take before dashing off to the emergency room is calling your doctor seeing if they. Think, for you right and then."
6663.0,Patient,You know i'm trying to do the non emergency you know. This is why I got right.
462.0,Provider,"Right. yeah and the coping, of course, as well."
6663.0,Patient,And I work with them.
462.0,Provider,"mm hmm right so there's the steps of trying to cope with it the steps of talking to your doctor seeing if there's anything they can do. Urgent care is also next before emergency rooms thing and there's an urgent care, you can go into that can do same day blood work and then, if if this is just all. Too much and you can't get any answers I mean you've gone to the emergency room before you know what what the situation is and anxiety can be really debilitating so i'll just. validate you there that two weeks of extreme anxiety, we can can be debilitating, and so it wouldn't be. I would understand if you could just go to the."
6663.0,Patient,"role, I can see it put me right back at step one. What I mean, I know I know like when you get your anxiety. And you get it under control and and it no longer is working and you stop falling backwards it gets a nightmare to crawl."
462.0,Provider,"mm hmm right So if you just truly feel like after you've taken all these steps you can't get an answer and you're not going to be able to make it through until next week, then you can always look into urgent care of the emergency room right that options there those services are there."
6663.0,Patient,"I know I got an appointment with Sean Sean tell. She scheduled one for me to schedule, one for with you want me today and then she's got one with me the 10th."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so you'll have one on that Monday right."
6663.0,Patient,"Well, thanks, so today."
462.0,Provider,"You can. today's Wednesday. yeah yeah. So you'll start the the week you'll already at least have had answers from your doctor, as far as what you can do, and you can start the week with checking in with her. And then. You know I mean. And just see if you can get by again without having to go into any emergency room and just using your coping and support."
6663.0,Patient,"that's my main goal. I just don't want you guys to think i'm whoopee if I end up going to the emergency room because. You may not know you know. It I know how it goes, are you."
462.0,Provider,Trying.
6663.0,Patient,To go there.
462.0,Provider,"very uncomfortable to have anxiety for a week straight, let alone going into a second week it's. Like I said it can be really debilitating. But it's it's you're taking the small steps before just running there, as I said, definitely one of them is just being open and honest with your doctor's office."
6663.0,Patient,So this is my goal tomorrow morning i'm going to call them she if there's anywhere way I can get this figured out.
462.0,Provider,yeah. it's a good start.
6663.0,Patient,"And then. After that itch number ones coping skills, then. And then number two is if I can't get nowhere is just you know, try to figure it out, try to. cope with it."
462.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6663.0,Patient,And if not. then take other steps to try to figure it out.
462.0,Provider,"Right and then, and one thing to ease your anxiety is knowing that you can always go to the emergency room no i'm not here to judge you for that no one's here to judge you for that so."
6663.0,Patient,Just like reading knowing an option. it's it's so crazy that like when I have my anxiety and panic attacks that I feel like i'm dying until I get to to to that emergency room and then i'm like i'm in good hands.
462.0,Provider,"Right so just knowing that that options, there can be comforting you don't have to cross it off because it's pride, or whatever it may be right that can be there as a part of your plan right now to get through this you don't have to do it, but you can, if it gets to that point."
6663.0,Patient,"Like I just try not I try not to because, like my anxiety is under control, you know I don't want you guys to think that it's not under control, because it is."
462.0,Provider,"You seem very under control, right now, just very panicked and worried about a valid circumstance that would cause."
6663.0,Patient,"yeah and it's just this temporary thing, hopefully, that is putting us back into it, that you know. It could not be that bad yeah I guess i'm slowly."
462.0,Provider,"right with anxiety disorder. Any if there's anything to worry about it will latch on to it and make it as difficult as possible right, even if. it's something where there is no logic to it."
6663.0,Patient,Oh yeah I can talk myself into dying. In an hour. horrible horrible.
462.0,Provider,just remind yourself.
6663.0,Patient,Out of your that as ventured sometimes men with you guys and pulled this.
462.0,Provider,"And it found it was like your anxiety disorders, like yes we've got something here like we can. You know ruin his next two weeks over this so just see if you can talk back to and say like."
6663.0,Patient,No you're not gonna double on detailed talking to the angel and the bickering back and forth.
462.0,Provider,So you can talk back and say you're not you're not welcome here this isn't the reality you haven't gotten any diagnosis of any sort you don't know anything as of right now so you're not going to be here i'm going to live in this moment and not think about the worst case scenario.
6663.0,Patient,"The end of the day I just need to say Aaron. No matter what it is, it is what it is. yeah I don't got no control over."
462.0,Provider,"You don't but what you do have is medical support, so no matter what it is, you have your health insurance, you have a doctor they'll help you figure it out."
6663.0,Patient,"No matter what that blood tests, or whatever you need to talk about from here until the 12 I can't change. My name so. It is what it is why you panicking about it. Is it still going to be the same from the fifth to the 12th."
462.0,Provider,yeah you can keep just talking to yourself talking back like I said talk back to the devil.
6663.0,Patient,"All right, do it. I tried again coaching coaching. My own coach coaching against anxiety."
462.0,Provider,"mm hmm yeah that's it's hard work, but you've got to keep doing it right now that's part of the."
6663.0,Patient,"Culture, most of it i'm pretty good. You know what I mean for the most of it. I recognize it."
462.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6663.0,Patient,"um I cope with it yep and you know and and I ain't saying that I can't this it's just I need to talk I needed to talk, because it was good yeah. I mean already on it, you know it's not like it's got got me it don't have me because I won't let it have me because i'll take two steps before like gollum you Eric i'll take the slums. before it gets too bad it's just I just needed to talk to you guys to see hey is there anything I can do, what can I do, is there any information. How should I go about this."
462.0,Provider,Exactly. yeah so you're doing all the. Right things.
6663.0,Patient,"I think I think Jesse that you gave me the best advice that you can. So it's up to me to follow up with that and it's up to me how I go about it, where i'm going I can't tell you. I could be in the emergency room don't have any public them."
462.0,Provider,"And like I said that's an option it's there on your list of ideas of things you can do, and it can come, for you know that's. always an option er is always open, you can always do that and there's. that's okay."
6663.0,Patient,"I leave that, as my last resort."
462.0,Provider,"I would definitely start with just calling first thing in the morning and seeing if there's anything they can do for you that'll give you a big yes or no and seeing how to carry forward. Okay, so you've got to just kind of get through tonight until you can talk to them in the morning and their answer will give you a large indication of how the rest of this weekend next is going to go."
6663.0,Patient,"Oh it's all gonna play, oh no. yeah."
462.0,Provider,"Why don't you try just taking a really big deep breath right now filling up your chest, and everything. Really slow exhale. Good and just keep trying to kind of tap into that big big deep breath. relax your body know that you're safe, which in turns calms your mind right, it might not feel like it, but if you just keep trying to work at slowing the breath, it does have a physical and mental effect."
6663.0,Patient,i've been taking bash lately because it relaxes me.
462.0,Provider,"Take some baths and do some deep breathing in there and like I said, you have a supportive partner and they might be scared to, but you can go in for just a big hug or a sit in a talk, or maybe just sit in silence, I just need someone to sit in silence with me."
6663.0,Patient,"With a lot of time just just silence, you know what I mean. isn't."
462.0,Provider,"Just right and that's Okay, sometimes it's it's helpful to sit in silence with someone."
6663.0,Patient,That was my biggest that's right biggest coping skill is like having quiet time.
462.0,Provider,"So. Like you. got what you cannot have today you've got some goals to work on and here's what we can do so tomorrow. You can. Either just move forward with with calling them and you work it out yourself if you need an appointment with me tomorrow just email me, and I can try to slip you in. As well as on Friday. If need be right if you need that extra support but otherwise you've got a bit of a plan here you've got a couple things you can work through and then that last resort of going to the er that's always an option."
