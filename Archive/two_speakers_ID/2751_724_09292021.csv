724.0,Provider,"For transcription looks good to me with Kimberly Elvis for a bio psychosocial assessment at 12pm Pacific standard time she has not checked into the clinic nor is she in the sessions waiting room, but I will continue to monitor for attendance. For transcription Kimberly Elvis was having difficulty checking into the virtual clinic but she is now here, I will admit her to start the psychosocial assessment."
2751.0,Patient,Hello. Hello hi.
724.0,Provider,Having some technical difficulties.
2751.0,Patient,I was yeah little bit yeah.
724.0,Provider,"It happens. Oh, my name is chuck i'm one of the therapists here i'm going to send them like that so. We have to meet today to do a bio psychosocial assessment, have you ever done one of these before."
2751.0,Patient,"And I remember when I first heard her you know, whatever it was like a year or two years ago, whatever um I remember a lady called me and was asking me questions is that."
724.0,Provider,"That could be. That could be it. During intake you get inundated with like a bunch of questionnaires and stuff like that so it's all very similar it's a medical record, if you will. So it's going to ask you questions about your biological history so like medical concerns. For you existing stuff medications that you're taking any kind of medical concerns that run in your family that might be like predatory. And then we'll cover some psychological questions and history, based on like diagnosis is of mental health concerns that you have or runs in your family will do some demographics, which is you know just like your basic information will start that in the beginning. and date of birth, occupational employment history like on the stuff. And then we'll talk about social settings so environmental factors like relationships. Living situations education history that kind of stuff and that's pretty much it so once it's done, the idea is that, like a. Like any kind of therapist or practitioner or provider could pick it up read it, and then get a. general understanding of what's going on with you and then develop like a treatment plan moving forward ultimately that's really The goal is to develop a good treatment plan based on this okay. yeah alright, so there are some questions in here that might be more personable that you don't feel like answering them that's fine we'll just table it for a different time. So don't feel like you're any pressure to answer every question and then there's somewhere it's going to ask like dates like when did you start using and stuff like that just trying to give me like an approximation of like an age range doesn't have to be specific."
2751.0,Patient,Okay.
724.0,Provider,"We don't need to worry about all that kind of good stuff um and it's it's almost like. it's like the questions are like like yes or no, and then we're going to keep moving on we don't need to like lots of description unless we we need clarification on something just to keep it moving because typically it takes about an hour to do one of these assessments so. We try not to get long winded with some of the responses. yeah but certain things obviously take longer that's fine too all right. Okay, any questions or concerns. nope alright so for the record state your name and date of birth."

724.0,Provider,"Any history of trauma physical abuse mental abuse, sexual abuse."
2751.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"If you want to get into the detail. You can, if not, then we can. what's your what's your social network look like what what's it made up of like your peers."
2751.0,Patient,How many friends. kind of a loner. i've really got a social anxiety like. hardcore so it's hard for me to.
724.0,Provider,Have you always had that or is that a new development.
2751.0,Patient,"um I feel like it's progressively worse, you know because I used to be very social like when I was in my early 20s and you know. And then i'm home. it's like the older i'm getting more scared I am of the world, you know people."
724.0,Provider,"it's not weird, no, no, I wouldn't say it's weird when you're younger. And you know we're all at that point we're we're pretty oblivious to the date has to the world, and I mean like in hindsight, like the. stuff that we did when we were teenagers like now you got kids and stuff like if you found that like your kids are doing what you did when you were a teenager you probably lose your cool in a big way, I know I would write. And then I think I like I think my parents and it's like the accountability that there was like none it's like i'd be gone all day like. As like a little kids no cell phones just be gone all day and I couldn't as a parent as a parent now it's like I couldn't imagine not know where my kid was for like eight or 10 hours out of the day um. So yeah, I think, as you get older you become more astutely aware of the dangers that exist in the world, but when you're young you're just naive it's like everything else, so I wouldn't say it's weird to feel that kind of way."
2751.0,Patient,"yeah, but it also like it's to me it's kind of like like like why isn't like to effects me so bad that like I don't even want to leave my house really you know so it's like other people doesn't affect like that so So why is that you know."
724.0,Provider,"Well, it could be a lot of there could be a lot of stuff why right, it could be organically. There could be a natural chemical imbalance in your hormones and that could exist, you could have had a significant event which makes it hard for you to process. That event which then makes it hard for you to want to go out and socialize and do things that's not uncommon when we suffer traumatic events we tend to isolate because our brain is trying to protect us. And we're not. necessarily ready to process that event and really work through the like the grief stage of it so that's on a common so that's a possibility, there are a lot of there are a lot of possibilities. And you just going to work through them."
2751.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"But you first get identified first though right so that's like that's that's the hard part it's like Why do I feel this way. So that's like the part of therapy where overtime, you would eventually come to some kind of understanding of like a root cause and then you would start working on it from there. um do you have like a family network, do you have you know people that you can call if you need help, or the the fan or somebody that you could depend on are trustworthy."
2751.0,Patient,"Sorry. um yeah I mean y'all my family my parents are very good or Great parents and um. But I mean I don't know like like the way I am i'm. Like I don't I don't engage with them, I guess you know enough I don't know. So not really like I have me my ex husband, but that's pretty much it, you know don't have anyone to like talk to you know."
724.0,Provider,"um. How are you gonna, how do you feel about being in groups here and doing. Physical therapy sessions."
2751.0,Patient,"As a group, I don't like it, because. I don't feel comfortable talking about how I feel yeah."
724.0,Provider,Is that because they're strangers and it's new or you just you're just not ready to talk about it.
2751.0,Patient,"i'm Ray you're talking about stuff about what do you get better you know, but you don't want to talk in front of an audience about it yeah. What want it to be. Private like."
724.0,Provider,"yeah what what I tell people to is the group setting like the group is isn't necessarily not that you're going to get like a lot of individual therapy, out of a group setting what you do is the purpose of the group is the get perspectives. Other people's perspective, especially like if it's a similar group. group mentality. and support you supposed to like developed peer support and insight know that kind of stuff but where you really work on your your individual stuff is obviously in the individual therapy. yeah so I wouldn't you know I wouldn't be drugged you for feeling that kind of way in a group setting because they are new your new to have their strangers, you know what to give up anything so you can play your cards close to your chest, which is fine, but. In the beginning just listen, you know what I mean the idea is that you're not alone right like we're all we're all in you know together, so the life experience as a whole is difficult. So it's really about receiving perspective and then. Maybe even some feedback and then you might hear something that. resonates with you and you might feel compelled to say something or yeah. And it's got its benefits, but you could sit back and kind of take it into there's not nothing wrong with that. Individual therapy, you could start on packaging. You know some of the some of traumas that life is dealt you and that that takes place over time. yeah do you have a preference in therapy, with a male counselor or female counselor."
2751.0,Patient,And female yeah.
724.0,Provider,kind of want a female okay.
2751.0,Patient,I prefer.
724.0,Provider,Again that's understandable um. Do you have you been to like a or na groups in the past.
2751.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yeah yeah today for just because I I did a, even though it was more of a drug problem, but I did a just because I like that program the way they works, the people, the way they were you know. yeah and opposed to. The group and I guess."
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah i've heard that a lot like I have like a lot of patients that would go to a because they didn't like the. Like the na. Like outlook, which I thought they've read. mentality yeah I thought they were supposed to run very similar but. A lot of people are like no it's not so a lot of people do they prefer a know they're more dialed in. Okay, what is your financial status look like."
2751.0,Patient,"i'm. In debt yeah. And I survived, you know that does."
724.0,Provider,"All right, i'm in your housing situation are you renting the you on."
2751.0,Patient,A wrench good.
724.0,Provider,"And is that stable. yeah okay all right. Do you live alone, or do you live with your kids."
2751.0,Patient,Oh me. me and my two kids we have a three bedroom apartment.
724.0,Provider,And the relationship with the ex husband is. Good.
2751.0,Patient,"yeah we are we're it's completely like mine, I still I still call my husband because we're still together. went to prison for four years. I divorced him when he was in prison for something stupid like I don't know kind of it's a long story, but but yeah so anyways I divorced and mortar but we were like still together and so like we live here, but we still like you know. Okay."
724.0,Provider,he's out of prison now.
2751.0,Patient,yeah he just got out in June.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, all right um and the the parenting you guys co parenting or are you so primary."
2751.0,Patient,um let's talk about co parenting.
724.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, good. and everything to do with that. yeah awesome no that's important."
2751.0,Patient,All right.
724.0,Provider,"um yes, I mean you got. A little support network. It could definitely be improved, like anything else um. But that'll happen over time, once you really. I try to tell people like you know when they feel this kind of way they're like I want to make friends, but I don't know how to make friends, I don't really know how to get back out there and it's like. that's probably that's probably an okay thing is really you can't be good to anybody else until your until you kind of got your shit squared away. You know. So it's like. For other people it's hard when you're not really making time for yourself, and if you got a lot of a lot of things that you want to work through it's probably better that way."
2751.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah I tried to like like I do whatever we do, like couples therapy or whatever we just started like a first session but. Like after the session or that i'm thinking in my head like like I question like shame, be doing this like like I need to like fix myself first, because you know how am I how am I can't just say oh you you, you know and it's asked me like sounds like i'm struggling with that well."
724.0,Provider,"The fact that you're getting that insight and those thoughts means that the therapies kind of working that's the whole point some sometimes therapies and so much about your feelings. You know what I mean like we're not necessarily. here to shield you from your feelings you're supposed to. Get vulnerable and do all those things, and then, when you leave those those sessions you're supposed to process and think about what you said you're like shit I wish I didn't say that. Really it's it's it's like the catalyst to get you to start thinking about that stuff a little bit more, and then being insightful and all that stuff that comes from just talking about your issues. else instead of just bottling it up. And if you don't have a big network writing helps you know what I mean it does help and then reading it out loud, you know because we learn. Humans learn a handful of ways, you know we learned through visual learning, we learned through auditory learning and we learned through kinesthetic so like writing. Activities you know repetition that kind of stuff, but when you. You are an eye on all of us we have things that we don't necessarily want to talk about we're having like really one sided conversations in our head. But you're not hearing it outside so you don't really learning you're not really processing it so that's why they leave a voicemail on somebody's phone and you hear it played back you're like oh my God I sound like that. you're right and it's like so what I tell people is that if you don't have anybody to talk to. And you're talking to yourself at least talk out loud so, then you can hear it. Because it's it sounds different way when it comes out of your your voice and when it's bouncing around inside your consciousness. And I tell people have journal, because the things that you might not be able to say because you're not strong enough yet you for sure can write down it doesn't take any emotional. write this stuff down right, I do journal, I do, I do have a journal, I mean."
2751.0,Patient,"I don't write it as much, but I don't have one."
724.0,Provider,"Yet so maybe get back into a little bit start there. Like pros and cons list do daily affirmations make a like a chore list put it on your fridge things that you want to get accomplished for the day and then check those boxes off throughout the day. So you can accomplish something that's really important to have that for like reward factoring. Little things like that you can do the kind of like just start tightening up your your all like well being and little stuff like that will help okay. All right, so what I can do is I can reach out to my supervisor and let them know that you prefer a female counselor and then we'll try to get you placed within that. So, other than that i'll have care navs reach out to you to reschedule. Follow ups with somebody you might have to meet with me one more time. And then. And then we'll get it going from there, do you have any questions or concerns."
2751.0,Patient,No really no.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, the last thing we talked about is the compliance component of it. You should be doing weekly surveys you'll have to do weekly surveys. They that the virtual clinic should have emailed you like a link to like the surveys like it's called like the band seven or. That you bookmark that that email and save that because that'll be the link that you'll use moving forward, every week, it will be required to do a couple of surveys so just. pick a night before your group, whatever your scheduled group is going to be and. it's complete those surveys they're important you know we don't just use them to control patients medications we do it because you know state and federal guidelines mandate that we have measurable. documentation for our patients in the self reported surveys, which you guys do is one way to measure patient progress or lack thereof so it's more than just a tool to control people's medication it's kind of important for all of us. We do read them. We do review practice review them so they're important."
2751.0,Patient,"yeah I never thought I never thought they did was like. Well, I guess, I never I never was assigned to a therapist oh I lost him at birth so like what every time I felt the survey like I felt. Like nothing that would be addressed but then, I guess, I never really talked to a specific."
724.0,Provider,"person yeah I mean what I mean I look at him and just to see where people are at because, like when I meet a lot of my patients are there in my group right so like when i'm sitting. i'm letting them, you know do their thing and we asked were like how you doing like everything's cool peachy darian great and you're like. Okay, and I don't read, so I take it at face value i'm like Okay, you know what I mean like this is. You know Level one care if you're telling me things are going good and things are going good things going bad they're gone bad like I don't have time, and this is through. telehealth like I can't tell if you're bullshitting or manipulating the system like I don't have time for it and honestly like like who does you know I mean. it's your treatment so like the only at the end of the day, the only person that doesn't benefit from it is like the individual so i'm like all right cool, but then i'll look at the survey i'm like oh Jesus. Is it is. had a tough week he's super anxious and even say that in group and I don't know why so like I tried to bring it up, and I see i'm i'm like you know what I mean it's like so what's going on with you, anxious no like no and i'm like that's not your services. And it's like okay."
2751.0,Patient,"yeah that's good I mean that's being held accountable, you know. that's hard for me just because I mean I say i'm fine, I will say i'm fine. me because."
724.0,Provider,"I do too I go to the doctors and like how are you i'm like perfect and I believe that i'm like damn I wish I told about this this this and this so it's like but that's that's why the surveys are good, because nobody's like nobody's with you, you know it's all self report."
2751.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
724.0,Provider,"So they are good. All right, well that's the plan will have somebody reach out to you and good luck and."
