298.0,Provider,"Thank you, I am on to the circle how's your sleep tell me about it."
13794.0,Patient,"Oh it's really good I don't I I mean like i'll still wake up, though, like it's not like i'm out and like you know i'm really like. train or anything like I saw will get up to pee and whatnot but um I don't struggle to fall asleep anymore, and I struggled with that, for years, and that was a big reason why. I drank so much for a long time, and took a xanax you know, on my own, for a long time, because I was just struggling with sleep so bad so it's really nice to be able to not worry about that."
298.0,Provider,yeah it is. Nothing makes me in a worse mood. faster than not having sleep.
13794.0,Patient,"yeah like I used to get so frustrated, I would like you know, I was just trying so hard to fall asleep and. Without anything, and I would just end up like crying because it's just like it's such a simple basic necessity of life that people take for granted, and when you can't do that, like it's just like your quality of life is really diminished."
298.0,Provider,So true. Okay um tell me about your short term memory or long term memory and your ability to focus right now.
13794.0,Patient,"um my short term memory could be better. My long term memory. isn't the best or school because I mean a lot of the last few years of my life I was kind of in a blur you know, like I did a lot to my and then I had this three seizures so I there's a lot of stuff I don't remember. But like as far like further back like I do, I remember a lot and then my ability to focus is pretty good I really think surprisingly, the gabapentin helps with that, for some reason."
298.0,Provider,"Right i'm glad i'm glad that you're taking it at a healthy level, but it would help with that. yeah are you having any negative side effects."
13794.0,Patient,"um. I think just maybe with this, it might I think it's the circle or i'm a little desensitized a little I feel like."
298.0,Provider,Oh kind of nami yeah.
13794.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
298.0,Provider,"Like you just associate. A minimum will try, cutting it in half, if he can still sleep. that's the. that's the kicker. Yes, still. It that is truly the kicker to see if you can still sleep and get the effects of seroquel but seroquel can do that that's a bummer the do you feel like your mood Sir all over the place."
13794.0,Patient,"Well, I noticed like yesterday I was like really was pretty irritable but, like, I was able to like control it, but I felt myself being like you know I don't know very annoyed but i'm wondering I just started a new birth control, so I don't know if it's like a hormonal thing."
298.0,Provider,"What is the birth control, is it it oral. The lamotrigine will make it in effective."
13794.0,Patient,yeah that's what everyone has been saying that it's or makes it less effective or just completely.
298.0,Provider,ineffective less effective that you run the risk of having a baby if you don't want would choose a different but oral contraceptives and limo true gene are not good.
13794.0,Patient,"Well, he has my primary has me on it, because he said, my estrogen levels were really low like after I got sober for."
298.0,Provider,"Now that's a different reason. That we are different reasons, so it's still would be so if you're not using it for you're not too worried about pregnancy, then then you'll be fine."
13794.0,Patient,"Okay yeah cuz he just said, I think, because the heavy drinking it messed up my hormones, or something."
298.0,Provider,yeah we all could use a little estrogen. yeah yeah.
13794.0,Patient,"yeah but um yeah so yesterday, I mean some days i'll feel like you know one second i'm like irritable and the next I kind of want to cry and frustrated milling i'm aware of it and and I kind of just you know work through it, I guess, but it's not. Good just it doesn't make my life dysfunctional in any way so."
298.0,Provider,Good. Okay well do you have any questions for me.
13794.0,Patient,No. Nothing so.
298.0,Provider,"Well you're looking good and I sent your scripts in and i'll see you. Now drinking wise, are you still having cravings."
