She literally called me a traitor like when I walked in like good morning trader like for the last couple of like weeks that like she knew that I was leaving. And it was like what are you talking about i've been a trader, since I got here like my mlt license since like the beginning of time like. And, and now you're just calling me a traitor like you know I don't know it's just I was like good thing I leaving this because I cannot handle that toxicity anymore like. It It makes sense if I had a good relationship with them kind of like a friendly you know, a friendly tiff but it wasn't it just it was rubbed me the wrong way."
252.0,Provider,"yeah. Understandable I mean it would have been taken in a day, it would have been if your relationship would have been different, but."
10006.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah if I had a good working relationship with this person or everyone else around me, I would have been totally fine with it later. But. Thank God, I now i'm just looking. Oh i'm looking at myself in the near future of like once I leave on Thursday i'm ready to take on like tasks independently to help with my well being know just because it's. i've been so tired like after the wedding after last like after Monday and Tuesday was my off day and then I was like working for like five days straight since then six days straight and i'm just like man, I am just ready to kind of focus on other things and. And and just focus even focus on my career as an empty because there's so much i'm still learning. But it's so funny I went to work and they're like you just got married congrats but why are you here, why, why are you here like why aren't you on your honeymoon and it's like you know. you're there right like Why am I there and it's like me and him we just decided that we're going to celebrate our wedding next year in San Diego my hometown. No more Canada it's not it's just not feasible we're not we can't do that but San Diego we are ready for it we're going to go. visit my parents, at the end of this month for the holidays and my birthday week and we're going to look at venues. And and and yeah just plan it out that way and and we are very happy about it just because now. We are not going to feel like the guilt like if something were to happen and we had our wedding in Canada and somebody had like a false positive coven then they would have to stay there for like a week or two."
252.0,Provider,or.
10006.0,Patient,"We just we won't be able to handle that I I wouldn't be able to forgive myself if I if a family member of our is like. stayed in Canada, just because our wedding cause that so it's just too much work to. Get. You know. We come. yeah."
252.0,Provider,yeah. I think that. yeah make it make it spectacular you know what I mean.
10006.0,Patient,"yeah we're planning that for sure i'm excited because we're going to have everyone there people from northern California, his family and my my folks from so cal like all meet together. In one roof having a good time celebrating our you know marriage since we're already married. I am very excited for that and his nieces and nephews little cute little kids rolling around running around like i'm excited and I know that I think you know for the for the for the last. couple of months, I was thinking like oh I, I want to try motherhood next year. And I think i've come to a conclusion that I, I want to enjoy married life, or at least one year. before settling down with a newborn, I think, and I think I made that decision with him. Just recently, so and it's crazy because I started taking prenatal vitamins like I thought I was going to be pregnant by like you know starting like next year right. But I think yeah we're going to enjoy our married life for a little bit, I think that would be fair for the both of us a part of me is like very kind of bummed out because I was looking forward to it. But at the same time he did make really good points and I don't want to be pregnant on my wedding Day next year if I want to like party and like dances everyone one All I want all around."
252.0,Provider,"You know what I was thinking that I always say that the the first year is hardest, but I don't think that that's true when you have already. been co had to have a tasting and been living life already you know, the only thing that's different at this point is a piece of paper, the mentality right and your last name. So, other than that everything stays the same you know still the same work, the same House the same job you know the same trust the same you know. So, giving yourself permission to. Just be for a year there's nothing wrong with that there's no hurry."
10006.0,Patient,"makes me feel good to hear from somebody else. Because I been in this like loop of you know, never ending loop of like should I do I should I not like I guess he's right but also like I. I always bring up this thing of his parents mortality and and he is starting to notice that and he doesn't like it when I do bring it up, but it it's just that that feeling I get of like his parents getting older. And that. I I would feel bad if, like they weren't around to see their first like grandchild."
252.0,Provider,from us.
10006.0,Patient,"And it's just like and I brought it up like maybe like five times already with him and he's like I can't like you can't bring it up with me like my parents mortality like you cannot remind me of that stuff like this is our life, we are running on our own timeline. etc, and like I believe him but part of me is like I know he cares about his parents parents are like 70 years 80 years old they're getting to that point and I just like. But I want them to experience I want him to experience his parents seeing and holding our grandchild or their grandchild right but not somebody else's not not his siblings and not anybody else's grandchild or. Right children. Because they're half siblings right like and his dad is that is actually his dad and his mom, and so I want to just I kind of want to give that to him give him that experience as as their son does that make sense. yeah yeah so."
252.0,Provider,"What I know is that if you were meant to get pregnant this year it's going to happen, no matter what you do. Right and if you weren't then it won't happen, and you guys can be able to plan it out a little bit longer, but our is his parents are they seek is or something they're just getting older."
10006.0,Patient,"it's just getting older and you know from time to time, there are things like issues with their with their bodies were like oh like his mom can't walk because she's having knee problems or you know arthritis or etc like just these things that kind of make their lives, a little bit. Difficult difficult yeah and and there are times, where it's like Oh, you know there's like a little like stairs here and there were like Oh, you know his dad has to go to the doctor the dentist because he pulled out to and. You know he has to get dentures and his dentures don't fit right and then he's like having these like painful like for his his mouth and it's just. Like one thing after another and and then I get like scared like oh my gosh I know they're getting older and older and like I have my parents to buy his parents are much older than my parents like at least by 20 years. 20 years older yeah and and I. Man yeah I just I want them to be around when we're when when we're ready like on our timeline of giving them that joy. mm hmm and and if that doesn't happen then i'm I don't want to feel that guilt I don't want to feel sad and I don't want to feel. Ah, out of my control right."
252.0,Provider,"It really is, if you think about it because, are you in birth control."
10006.0,Patient,"I am yeah I know really actually for my acne because I was having like really bad cystic acne and you know how i'm. insurances they think that acne would be like more cosmetics and they wouldn't help with that without all that stuff. yeah but like birth control has been amazing for my skin and i've been so happy, but now it's becoming a little bit more serious i'm like hey you know I don't really need to take birth control anymore if i'm thinking about having a baby but. yeah i've been on it for a long time now, like since my teenage years like 1718 years old i've been on."
252.0,Provider,"Okay yeah the reason why I ask. Is because, even if you get off of the birth control, you know."
10006.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,it's still on happen until your higher powers so.
10006.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, that is true, as well, yes that's why I saw I made an appointment to see an Ob G last week, and he said yeah it'll take you up to like. three to six months to like for your body to go back to where it was before he took a report he took birth control, and it might take that long for you to actually conceive and. And it's like okay like yeah it's gonna have to take some time anyway, I yeah I totally get that or it could happen magically like all you know all suddenly when I stop who knows right."
252.0,Provider,"yeah oh my God we're gonna happen, while you're still on it too."
10006.0,Patient,"yeah yes, yes, looks like i've survived the last 20 years."
252.0,Provider,"Years being on it nothing's happened so far so. I just seen some some weird flukes when it came to that like one friend I have she actually adopted. I mean her and her husband have been trying for years and then she goes in adopts you know, a kid and then Bam she's pregnant, this is like you know. I mean people get pregnant on birth control, I have seen people. be told that they couldn't have any kids and have kids I mean it's just it just makes you know makes my mind, and my confirmation that is it really in our control. not really."
10006.0,Patient,"not really yeah. I know I I do think about that from time to time, and then a part of me is like, I do have a little bit of control, because I know that if i'm taking birth control, I won't get pregnant. As you know, as we've seen throughout the years so but I have I don't know what it's going to be like if i'm off birth control, like there's going to be, you know sides and. Side effects symptoms, whatever like I don't know what that might be, you know or I could get pregnant right away, and I have twins like who knows."

Because i've already left so i'll be i'll definitely have more time and and less on my mind about like committing to another job. yeah and it's crazy because, like my coworkers are like he just stands on March, April June next year and i'm like heck no i'm not sticking. And and and they were like kind of like jokingly telling my boss that i'm going to retract my notice and i'm just like come on guys like this is so unprofessional like you cannot accept speaking on my behalf. Like just because i'm leaving like it, it really like upsets me that these people are like that there and it's happening like even on my last few weeks, even during my last few weeks there it's I don't appreciate that type of like attitude and that that energy. is so messed up. I don't understand it."

10006.0,Patient,honestly.
252.0,Provider,i'm i'm ready to skip out that door and now you're telling me that. You appreciate me.
10006.0,Patient,"yeah and my manager like I guess the last two weeks to she pulled me aside to her office, and she wanted me to pick up more shifts for the last few days that I was that i'm going to be there and it's like. Like in my head like obviously I had to show my professionalism and said okay i'll try, I will guarantee it because i'm picking up more shifts over at this other lab with Miller and then she's like no, you need to talk to him and tell him that I need you, the mo. And it's a little light. And she was telling me how she was telling talking to me about how oh I just don't want people to feel burnt out and. It looks like. it's like it's not my problem that's a huge problem. that's not my problem that's a huge problem."
252.0,Provider,Like.
10006.0,Patient,"I really did, but like I can't like i'm not going to pick up our shifts for you, because what is that going to make me do like I mean you're not going to pay me unless you pay me like two three times is, but other job is paying me then yeah i'll do it, but. I can't like that's just ridiculous."
252.0,Provider,yeah very much so.
10006.0,Patient,"She spent like 20 minutes talking to me in her office about having me pick up more shifts in stuff before the end of my day or before the end of you know my notice and i'm. I mean I I got paid for that conversation. I was going to clock out earlier, but she was like Oh, can I speak to you in my office and I was like sure why not and i'm going to get paid for this for talking to me about staying so i'm not going to. Be unpaid, for her asking me to stay, you know and pick up more shifts so Luckily, the supervisor I work with she already turned in my last final paycheck to HR so. i'm actually happy about that. Because it's already solidified my final paycheck that's going to be sent to me. Like physically right because I have to have my last final paycheck physically in my hand. They don't direct deposit it anymore so it's like good I you don't have to pick up any extra shifts so, then I don't have to give my supervisor any more problems of you know, oh, you need to like. You know change my final paycheck because i've picked up more shifts or I picked up more hours, etc, so it just solidified me just the last few the last the last schedule days that I have to work there is what I have to work good."
252.0,Provider,enough to door. Do it right.
10006.0,Patient,"Yes, hundred percent um I it is bittersweet though I think better see is the right word i'm not entirely sure, but I do i'm going to miss. Drawing blood a lot, like the patient care experience I really love it it like it's really fulfilling and rewarding. And i'm just going to be sad that i'm going to be leaving that behind now, I guess, for now, I suppose, because I, technically, I can always find a phlebotomy job, but just for now i'm focusing on mlt and thinking about it just saddens me a little bit. Late yeah yeah."
252.0,Provider,"i'm gonna be a transition for sure. You know, but the great part about it is that you cannot. I would think I don't know, but you, you know if maybe the place that you're going to need help, maybe, something that you could offer a few more hours here and there to help them in that area, you know."
10006.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah I told my supervisor over at the at the mlt place that hey i'm leaving i'm leaving the other job i'm ready to pick up more shifts for you like. i'm here and i'm committed so i'm actually i'm happy i'm happy that i'm going to be getting paid the way that i'm supposed to be getting paid as a lab person. For my new license that i'm finally using and not like backbreaking sweaty work that I have to deal with here at the other job. Right so. yeah I am looking forward to it all."
252.0,Provider,"Those uh the this is totally off topic. Your background, it reminds me of low pub stakeholders."

Like supportive for other people around me like my husband's friends who actually suffer from anxiety and depression as well and and that like i'm recommending the feeling great book or feeling good book. And it's it's Nice because i'm also called talking to my co workers, and you know she's always been around that stigma of depression in Depression and anxiety and and how people look down on people taking pills and etc and and i'm just like all about ending that you know it. If there's help there's help like hundred percent take it, you know, and I hundred percent like would totally recommend it to anyone, I would recommend this group therapy to anyone, because it's nice to have you know people who are there and understanding and hear you out without judgment. yeah and. yeah i'm just happy about that has the book and got doing well, for you guys as well or."
252.0,Provider,yeah we actually. We actually took this last chapter that we were going through it's actually a little bit of Chapter three we're taking into all the groups on resistance.
10006.0,Patient,Ah.
252.0,Provider,"It was pretty amazing because that book is really Co. The that book and the anxiety and phobia workbook if they backed each other up and the information. And so really identifying and addressing any resistance to the process of change resistance to the outcome of change and to really evaluate where you have it, and that could be in regards to doing the homework."
10006.0,Patient,You know.
252.0,Provider,The big thing you know.
10006.0,Patient,"psychotherapy homework. yeah it's like the main thing that the book like you know stands on its it is it's like the epitome of that resistance like if you don't do it like it. You will never know whether or not it works or if it's affecting you I know for sure it worked for me, because I was so I was suffering, I was like I don't like feeling this way I feel. Like crap I feel like you know if I helped myself it's like a diet right it's like losing weight too it's like. it's just anything for your well being if it like if it's beneficial for your well being like 100% go for it and, and I feel like I felt that way with this book tremendously i'm. Not."

252.0,Provider,i'm gonna hurt. And if it works on my God. And if it doesn't gone to the next.
10006.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. So that's good the anxiety on phobia workbook the so there's like barely know like contradiction contradictions between the tail. I guess, they are going hand in hand, very nicely."
252.0,Provider,"yeah and we're talking a lot about thinking errors cognitive distortions which really in that at the chapter that we're in and the other book in the anxiety, for we work book is about cognitive distortions. You know it's just kind of it's just going, you know i'm just amazed about it, you know, and I love feeling I love that book feeling great I just do I think you know, understanding and knowing the way that we think in our thinking errors and distortions."
10006.0,Patient,mm hmm.
252.0,Provider,they're amazing.
10006.0,Patient,"yeah and the story is that he puts in there are like me off the charts like almost as if, like they just don't seem real, but they are real from real life patient so it's like. yeah like I guess things can go word can go, you know we're in our lives, which is like these people in these books. who are experiencing these things and and it's nice actually see you know his work with them and how and how they improve and what his methods are in techniques are to help them improve. Because it just makes you wonder like hey I wonder if this will work for me, too, and if it does, it does if it doesn't then obviously great right like. Right keep working."
252.0,Provider,on to the next day.
10006.0,Patient,yeah yeah and it's better than just moseying around and suffering.
252.0,Provider,that's right.
10006.0,Patient,"yeah i've definitely realized that with the whole Depression and anxiety is I was just so tired of being. Tired. tired of being depressed tired of being anxious all the time, tired of like always like. You know checking my back and just like always I guess feeling doubtful of myself even like it's helped me become more confident in like my decision. Decision making i'm just because, like I know now know, like my what is it like my core values like if I think of my core value as like a shining star like that is my guidance and. it's helped me so much because i'm not stuck i'm not stuck in in like feeling so down and out and hopeless in. You know, like I have good things in my life i'm feeling more and more grateful of. of everything around me and like even with the seat a low power like it's helped like so much like i'm almost to the point where maybe I don't need it, you know and. But uh but also it's it's been such a great tool with me with my mental health so almost to the point where like i'm scared like if I get off of it because I haven't been off of it for a little bit and. You know and and the whole pregnancy thing like I when I was talking to the Ob G, he was like oh it, you know there's no really there's no like studies of of like pregnant women being on on on antidepressants however it's ideal that you shouldn't be on it. During the child's development and he's and sort of he also said, I can I can continue taking it at 16 weeks, but ideally to be off of it during you know pregnancy. And, and I think that you know I if I do happen to go down that line of pregnancy, I think i'll be okay without it."
252.0,Provider,um. What is that is that zoloft.
10006.0,Patient,A pseudo problem lexapro.
252.0,Provider,"lexapro okay i'm. just talk to Mary about whether or not something like that has to be. tape or doom, or if you could just stop it."
10006.0,Patient,yeah. I did I messaged her last to group therapy is I think she said cuz I was like do I have to wean off of it and it's I guess i'm already on the lowest. lowest dose.
252.0,Provider,Of the way to do.
10006.0,Patient,That all you have to do is stop. yeah so um but I don't know I mean now that i've kind of switched to maybe i'll enjoy the next year as a you know married couple and and and have one job we'll see how that goes.
252.0,Provider,"You know what I mean. yeah routine. You know. keep doing yourself care, you know, to me, enjoy life for a little bit because you've certainly earned it."
10006.0,Patient,yeah Thank you Rebecca I have yes. Ever since I moved here it's been such a like a whirlwind of. successes and achievements.
252.0,Provider,"yeah. Yes, you're in a great spot right now just enjoy it for a little bit. Stop and smell the dandy lines. Right."
10006.0,Patient,"yeah. there's a lot there's this just I get so overly excited about things and it's like sometimes i'm like Okay, I need to slow down. But i'm like so excited you know, like. Why do I, why do I need to dampen this."
252.0,Provider,it's funny. i'm so glad it's going on the joy side you know.
10006.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,Very much so.
10006.0,Patient,i'm. not waiting for.
252.0,Provider,"it's all been work, work, work and no play."
10006.0,Patient,"yeah it really has it really has and and and I need to think about myself too because it's like I hear these people saying like Oh, you need help, we need help, like I need help, like I get I know you need help, like i'm ready to help myself too. And I need to learn how to say no, and my I guess work more like more with my boundaries. and help my husband helped my husband, with his boundaries, because he is you know he does struggle with like anxiety and depression and and he. And he studies, he says he's like so proud of me and and that he wished that he had the help. You know, during his younger years that i'm having right now with group therapy and you know, a psychotherapy of psychiatrists and therapists working together to help me and he said he wished he had that back in the day and now it's like mental health professionals are so cast. Now, because of koga and. it's crazy because, like his insurance they gave him I guess the therapist from Missouri. And there's like no connection at all, she doesn't know what lockdown is she doesn't understand the life of Bay area like you know work and work and work and. And it's like I you know I feel like i'm being a therapist for him, sometimes you know because he's not having a connected therapist and."
252.0,Provider,If he's asked for a different one.
10006.0,Patient,yeah and so he tried but it's like they're so tax that there's not none available in the area and it's like why like I don't understand like. yeah I don't know yeah.
252.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah he says it doesn't do. It doesn't do any good to have a therapist that you don't connect with on some level. yeah I mean it just it will work. You know she doesn't understand or can't can't put herself, you know her life is different right if she can put herself in that city life and understand that work is it you know we have to learn how to develop the rest of our life. mm hmm right, and so, and so he can't correct me if I heard you wrong, he cannot get a different therapist."
10006.0,Patient,"know, for some reason, I have no idea why he said it's just the it's taxed he's not able to get like a different therapists I I don't even know what the whole story is, but he I guess he just stopped, seeing that therapist from Missouri and just thought that all in. As a whole, just because it was just so complicated for him to."
252.0,Provider,go through this insurance at work.
10006.0,Patient,"Through his insurance at work, I believe yeah but you know what not to come to think of it, he is now at a new company, so I think he may might have a different like. different type of insurance that might be able to help him because he's actually contracted with the new company he just started working for a month ago."
252.0,Provider,There you go.
10006.0,Patient,"So I am now now come to think of it, yes, there might be something else that I don't know about, yet that might be better for him for him to get the help that he needs but yeah his last job it was offered but did not work out so well for him. Just didn't make sense there's like no connection from someone who lives out in Missouri and then like connecting with someone who lives in the city life of California northern California it just didn't make sense. To have that."
252.0,Provider,"yeah it really doesn't so I definitely check into it, because i'll tell you what when he gets a therapist that can relate. Up unstoppable look at you."
10006.0,Patient,"yeah yeah he has been so happy and proud of me and almost he was almost like envious in a way, and I was like you know what i'm here i'm here to help you to like if you need the help I know i'm not like like Rebecca like you or Mary right, but I can be a support system. And I didn't feel bad you know I did feel bad that he had that he was getting that type of help that wasn't for him yeah. I feel like now he's he's having a better work life balance so i'm i'm very happy and glad that that's working out because yeah he actually has like what's now called protected time between the hours of 12 into. not supposed to have meetings between 12 and two and you can do anything you want for that timeframe want have lunch take a nap and it's like that is work life balance that is awesome. So."
252.0,Provider,Two hours from 12 to two.
10006.0,Patient,yeah they call it protected time.
252.0,Provider,We are holy protected. that's amazing.
10006.0,Patient,Now yeah i'm I feel like any remote job should have that protected time you know if we don't get three day weekends four day work weeks. are like healthcare professionals should have three day weekends. And four day work weeks.
252.0,Provider,yeah because no matter what they're working 10 to 12 anyways.
10006.0,Patient,yeah I think we would have much healthier and happier lives if that was the case.
252.0,Provider,"I think, so too definitely yeah and you think also but in other countries, you know dads are allowed to take maternity leave, you know it is a balance of it all. You know. That is important."
10006.0,Patient,"If only we could follow suit, with those other countries."
252.0,Provider,"I know wouldn't that be nice. slaves to the grind. sleep, you know what I mean we're just work, work, work, work, work and don't stop working till you're dead. yeah we forget that there's this whole life out here that you know this whole universe that."
10006.0,Patient,"Oh, my gosh."
252.0,Provider,You know.
10006.0,Patient,And yeah.
252.0,Provider,"So you enjoy. Your time that you don't have to work. Stop and smell the flowers. notice the small things slow down just a little bit enjoy what you have worked so hard for. Give yourself permission for that, because you know what you have earned a girl. let's remember that. Thank you Rebecca more days. Do more day."
10006.0,Patient,"Two more days, no more toxic days i'm looking forward to it."
252.0,Provider,More toxic days and that's going to play a even bigger factor on your Depression and anxiety when your your body and your mind come together to realize that you don't have to go back to that environment.
10006.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, they don't have to be split like I felt like when I was working there they my mind was like split you know. Like i'm comfortable here, but then again something's eating out here. you're just like ah."
