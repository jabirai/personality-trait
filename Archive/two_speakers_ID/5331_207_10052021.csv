207.0,Provider,"i'm good i'm better now that i've seen you. What happened brandon did I chase you away what happened come on let's get real let's have a real conversation for event. It was always fun, you will come in a group. You were coming to you individually and then, I guess, I said something to you after you don't have the flooding your basement and you decide to get all your."
5331.0,Patient,pretty much I was really busy I probably just. do a lot but i'm all caught up no Sir thanks good.
207.0,Provider,Your car who are caught up with brandon because he was under discharge this.
5331.0,Patient,"Hopefully, not no more."
207.0,Provider,You tell me brandon and and you know what's crazy I don't even hold you that long for individual. 30 minutes out of your week.
5331.0,Patient,"yeah it's just a problem I have is I see you Monday and like I do brick pavers for 11 I run a crew like I own my own company. Mondays is like the busiest time of the week, for me, so in me taking an hour out of my day to sit on my phone with four sometimes five employees on the job site paying them over $20 an hour. You know what I mean it's just. it's hard exploring going to the Tuesday night at eight o'clock group. that's what I was going to talk to you about and another thing i'm going to Florida Thursday. To Miami I fly out Thursday and then I fly back Monday and i'm flying right when our group is like I think we have to be at the airport at 1123 is our plane. And I didn't think of that we plan to vacation last weekend and I didn't bring it up on Monday yesterday so i'm telling you now."
207.0,Provider,Do you go to.
5331.0,Patient,The 11 o'clock on Monday.
207.0,Provider,You weren't there yesterday were you.
5331.0,Patient,"I was there, but you kicked me out of it, you told me."
207.0,Provider,"I love I love the word kick. kick you out I love the word. know you go tell people Oh, she kicked me out of the group whoa. whoa meaning graduates to con."
5331.0,Patient,"Well, you know I mean you told me to leave so."
207.0,Provider,"I told you, you had the Lead is that the words that are you bringing. Or did I say you have to go back to the virtual clinic because you were on the discharge list. How you and then i'm sure. God and people don't come be like oh I don't want to work, whatever sharp because she'd be kicking people out of group and whatnot nor brennan alright so Okay, this is the thing okay truth be told, is that. you're not the only person that is going through this whole you because again it's not just what I find is that everyone a lot of people are just coming to the group and they're not keeping up with the program requirements. you're gonna say."
5331.0,Patient,I get it yeah.
207.0,Provider,"And so, if it is a situation where like you said you're working and you're you're you're technically a laborer, meaning that you're not sitting in an office, where you can just pop up your phone while you were you're outside. I completely understand, being a laborer so the difficulty in that, especially when the rules are coming at that. You know a lot of people who are doing that are not allowed to do that because of i'm not 100% sure are do you have a headset you know your everybody walking around is able to see that. So then, now that they have the groups on Tuesdays at 8pm I mean I don't know you'd be laying bricks at eight o'clock at night."
5331.0,Patient,"No, that would work perfect I would I wouldn't ever missed a group and that'd be exactly what I need. To so."
207.0,Provider,"And that would work for you also you can also be transferred to a therapist I think there's one therapist or two therapists that sees Michigan patients that made you after hours, when your. evening hours if you're available if that that works better, for you, that is also another option that I can put in a request for you to get transferred to another counselor that is able to meet with you in the evening, if, during the day is hard for you."
5331.0,Patient,"yeah that's my biggest problem is is the time that like I don't know every time if you've noticed when I when I do go to group it's like i'm either driving or. i'm at the job site, or just kind of preoccupied at the same time it's hard for me to do it like I try but and then sometimes it just crosses my mind I don't even remember it. I just totally forget about it, I got so much stuff going on Monday morning at three o'clock comes around, and I call shit today's Monday I had group at 11 so that's."
207.0,Provider,"Not a problem I put in a request i'll put in a request for you to get transferred to i'll put in. I think her name is Julie, I don't know if her her group is big, yet I put I think her name is Julie, so our request for you to see if you can get transferred to her, because that works better, for you. It has to get approved and i'll also put in a request I think there's two therapists that that sees patients in Michigan. And so i'll put in a request to either one of them, to see if they do evening appointments and if they do even appointments that if you can get transferred to them to be able to accommodate an evening appointment."
5331.0,Patient,Okay yeah Now the question I have two is. Next Monday i'm like I said over my plane leaves at 11 something I could possibly check in at 11.
207.0,Provider,"Oh no no don't. I don't. I would have what i'll do is i'll. Did okay so docker for Rocco did put in. I put it in that you won't be available you won't be able to attend group next Monday, because he did put in a request for two weeks or three phil for two weeks because he's not going to be there on to on Monday. So I will put in the request of our put it into cancel your group for next Monday, because you will be traveling. So split, you will already because remember, he says, if you get a week refill, you will have a refill in there. So let me double check your chart hold on. Yes, so you get because you you take it three times a day so for seven days, so you have a refill in there, so you should you should be fine for next week. If you, if I excuse you from groupon money. Okay, and so, with your drug screen you just did that on Monday. Okay, so you're good on that for. me look at anything everything else. Now brandon I see here that. Your flag for. A risk for suicide I don't know if it's something that when you filled out those surveys So what if you want to let's just kind of chat a little bit about."
5331.0,Patient,"have no idea why that's on there, you told me that two months ago to I have. no idea what that's on there for. Maybe I fill out a survey wrong or something."
207.0,Provider,"Oh, you know what oh wow it seemed like you. that's a year. yeah because the other ones came back fine that you. Any stress, depression or anxiety."
5331.0,Patient,No.
207.0,Provider,"All right, so um. alright. So let me change that to Okay, so this is what i'm going to recommend them. i'm going to recommend. That, because this is requiring you. Okay, so you got all your surveys completed. Okay, so you're going to have to stay on the weekly group of once I get you transferred over you're going to have to stay on the weekly group for the. For a month because the three times a week it's pretty much two for a month, so you're going to have to stay on the weekly group for a month until you're fully compliant with every year just maintaining the compliance. And then, at that point, it can be reevaluated to go back to every other week. Okay, but brandon if we get you switched over to the evening groups and you see the therapist in the afternoon. just stay on top of that okay."
5331.0,Patient,"I will for sure, be 10 times easier for me."
207.0,Provider,"and hold on, let me address. and your address, is still the twit 23514 Wagner avenue right."

5331.0,Patient,You ever been to Miami.
207.0,Provider,Of course i've been to Miami I despise Miami I will not go there for love nor money.
5331.0,Patient,"No, you know I get."
207.0,Provider,I hate Miami with everything in me and I don't speak Spanish because i'm in America and i'm not speaking Spanish to go to Miami.
5331.0,Patient,But. There we went to go in there for a resort run on the beach.
207.0,Provider,we're in we're in Miami you're going to.
5331.0,Patient,Miami beach. it's a it's called the palms. resort.
207.0,Provider,me you're gonna go. close to the rich and famous I guess.
5331.0,Patient,yeah that's the that's the plan go down there and see scarface his house. You know. cruising sob see some really nice houses out there.
207.0,Provider,"You know the thing is with Miami It reminds me, have you been you've been to New York right."
5331.0,Patient,i've never been to New York know. If i've been in Michigan and California and Ohio.
207.0,Provider,"It see the thing is New York or Miami Miami reminds me a lot of New York, in the sense like these, one way streets and just the it's just so. crowded and it's just crazy, but the difference between New York and Miami is that Miami you have a lot more Hispanics that live there. And so it's very a lot of times very hard to communicate don't speak Spanish. And so that's what you find but, again, if you're into like like that party life and all of that, and like the beach, and all of that that that's the not a nice place to be i'm not into that stuff so I don't necessarily care for it."
5331.0,Patient,yeah we're gonna try it out a couple clubs on there.
207.0,Provider,yeah there's a lot of restaurants and just so if you're if it's just you and your your fiance. And that's a nice little weekend getaway maybe football says you don't do what I want doing you know i'm doing jack. So.
5331.0,Patient,"No hurricanes come down there but we'll be all right, I don't think there is any in the forecast."
207.0,Provider,"Know there's I don't think there's any, but I think right now they're predicting some kind of cool front coming through. So, and you know again Florida is unpredictable in terms of the weather, but i'm sure for the weekend, he said, this weekend right."
5331.0,Patient,"yeah yeah Thursday, Friday Saturday Sunday Monday. will be all the way. All the way in Miami beach. What is the, what is your in Florida right."
207.0,Provider,"yeah but i'm about so from Miami I would say i'll probably from where you're going, I would say i'm probably a good two hours away so hours north. that's where i'll be so like you go to the the fashion district in the art district, and all of that, like you can look up different things to places places to go and things to do and. You know, go over there by where the the the stadium is. um so it's a lot to do it, a lot of walking i'm sure like you park one place, and then you walk a lot of the places because it's just better to do it like that, unless you just want to have Road rage and you just go drive and just get mad. But after back here from Miami at all."
5331.0,Patient,Areas down there by Miami to go look at. You know anything good.
207.0,Provider,"that's what i'm telling you i'm like i've seen people friends or family of mine have come down here, which I did say that I wanted to go to. To go down there there's this place called like the fashion district look up the fashion district i'm sure your fiance would love that arm there is oh my God. there's this one place, that I see. Like when you, you see the picture like they have little umbrellas in the air and it's really nice I can't think of the name. I can't think of the name, there is definitely if you're where you're going there is a lot to you won't be bored there and that's kind of how New York is. Right, you cannot be bored going there, but when you go just just just Google like things to places to go and things to do. um but I can't think of the name off the top of my head, because a girlfriend and I were supposed to go down there one day, but then it started raining and we didn't end up going because it's all outdoors. But. Just look up just places to go down there because there's a Venetian Venetian Isles, or something like that. What is it the Venetian pool or something like that just look up different things, and it will show you a lot of places to go and see but just brush up on your Spanish words. you'll, you will have a lot of fun i'm sure you'll come back and you'll say you'll have a lot of fun. You know, but again just keep it keep it kosher okay miss brandon come back just have a nice clean fun and you'll enjoy yourself i'm just you know, like when you're from a place you don't necessarily care to go certain places, but then I will not discourage people from visiting it. Is it's definitely nice it, I would say it's better to go to Miami than to come up to Fort lauderdale because Fort lauderdale yes, there is the nightlife but I don't think there's anything better for a visitor than to go to my name so don't go to Miami it's nicer."
5331.0,Patient,i've been to click I think it's clear water.
207.0,Provider,yeah look you're going over into Tampa Bay like that's free that's going all the way West.
5331.0,Patient,that's the West side of of Florida right. yeah that's that's the white sandy beaches over there.
207.0,Provider,"Yes, yes you're closer to the Gulf of Mexico over there."
5331.0,Patient,yeah that's that's where I went last time. i've been there with with my grandmother that was shit 15 years ago.
207.0,Provider,yeah and there's nothing really much to do over on that side.
5331.0,Patient,"There wasn't it was it was just the beaches and a bunch of hotels and restaurants and I think there was one like arcade which some go karts that we did, and that was about it, it was like a retirement place where there was a lot of tennis playing, I would say."
207.0,Provider,"yeah. it's it's like I said you'll you'll, you will have a whole lot of. A whole lot of fun. You could go to a little Havana. um there's this one place, though. You don't want you know what is something that you can do, why don't you go on groupon and see different things that you can, if you if your your your your fiance or into sightseeing. Go on groupon or just put in things to do in Miami and you'll you'll see all the different fun things to do in places to win would was that's the name of it when would was."
5331.0,Patient,When would walls.
207.0,Provider,"yeah why n w O D walls when would want, and then I think there's something about the fashion district that's another thing that I see a lot of people do. Is they go to this place it's the fashion district and it's like you see little umbrellas that's on top of you, and all this different stuff that you see but. it's something nice, especially to take pictures and just enjoy yourself and work hard definitely go and treat yourself and have fun, but this is what i'm going to do Brendan i'm not going to reschedule another appointment with me i'm going to put in the request to have you. transferred to another counselor and and have them in once I put in that request and they accept it, then I will have them set up a follow up appointment and have mark email it to you or send you the when the next appointment is."
5331.0,Patient,"All right, i'm sorry. And then I will try to check in next Monday, depending on how it goes just to make sure that I, you know nothing's forgotten, and then I get my screen."
207.0,Provider,"In the in the hole in the whole thing i'm going to put in there. For them to cancel your your group for next week, because you will be traveling at the time of the group. Alright, so in there, but you're still going to be on the. weekly group for at least a month or two, and then they can re evaluate if you could go back on every other week."
5331.0,Patient,"i've never been on every other week i've always been on every week, the whole time i've been here."
207.0,Provider,"Well, I had started moving people around to every other week or month because look let's see when did you join when did you start the Program."
5331.0,Patient,Year and about a year.
207.0,Provider,"But what okay what time do you get off work, let me."
5331.0,Patient,"I worked to approximately like four or five o'clock and then I had home. someday six on day seven depending on if we're getting the job done or not, but. Like I said i'm i'm my own boss I. I have people that work for me and. You know if it's Monday at 10am or 11am it's like physically the hardest. time for me to do group."
207.0,Provider,So yeah so you've been around for about a year. A little over a year.
5331.0,Patient,anytime in the afternoon or evening would be ideal.
207.0,Provider,"yeah I know the Tuesday, eight o'clock group is better for a lot of people um so i'll put in the request for you to go for that. So I will put in the request for you to get switched over and have them send you something just to update you on that, but at least for next Monday I haven't canceled that group okay."
5331.0,Patient,yeah and can you have them text me instead of email me that possible because I get so much of my email I gave you guys it's like case email type deal so okay i'll put it in for him to text you once they.
207.0,Provider,Once they hit schedule it.
5331.0,Patient,"that'd be great. Okay, all right."
207.0,Provider,"All right, then, my dear so have a great weekend and, as I said, have fun, but clean fun."
