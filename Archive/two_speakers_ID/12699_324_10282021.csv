And I just slept a lot so. it's hard when it's like the best I think I handled it better than I would have been awesome than often.

Like I know some people say that, like i'm always like it takes me like two or three hours to like kind of Perk up after I take it, so like I just can't really sleepy couple. office yeah like 2020 minutes are like a while after taking and it's weird. But I usually pick up them okay and appetites fine."
324.0,Provider,"I know, like I say you're under a lot of stress i'm. at any point K any self harm or suicidal thoughts."
12699.0,Patient,"That I had so far thoughts, but didn't act upon them. Because usually I would act upon them, but."
324.0,Provider,don't say self harm like cutting.
12699.0,Patient,Cutting yeah that was. My mo back in the day I talked to my sister my sister like please don't hurt us so yeah so I have my sister she's a nurse so she's and she actually worked in youth sideboards for a long time. Once you got out of. School so she's really good at that stuff. So yeah I was like I was like really glad to have you as my sister cuz.
324.0,Provider,i'm gonna say i'm proud i'm really proud of you as far as um. As actually will say those toolbox that you pull those tools out to cope with stress. So yeah yeah I commend you for that.
12699.0,Patient,"yeah it was really hard. It wasn't very fun, not a good day."
324.0,Provider,"yeah I would just you know. So, you know how to dry. um. But I will work on it um do you have a car currently. No okay. Oh."
12699.0,Patient,The cars are very expensive and I feel like a car is going to eat through my whole savings. that's the thing about it. Even though we have lots of cars here which sucks like. My parents don't like six cars and then I can't use any of them.
324.0,Provider,"there's definitely like I said there, it is just going to take coming up with that plan. You have a drop something drivers like to have that. I don't know if they have and i'm pretty sure through the dmv even if you signed up for could you don't meet the license but i'm take a class or driving class."
12699.0,Patient,"Maybe wanting to do and it's like a lot of them are expensive I don't know who's to the dmv here but. it's just hard to small town so there's not a lot of options and like I found some and it's like just like three driving glasses kind of thing and it's like I need something like where I practice law like that's what I need. Because I feel like it's a confidence thing like I don't feel confident behind the wheel, so I have panic attacks."
324.0,Provider,"Do you think, maybe, if you talk to your mom about it. And just kind of you know, and just kind of be upfront and say look i'm working on, you know i'm working on i'm getting out of here. He um. But I I right now I do need help, I would love to I haven't driven I was in San Francisco I didn't have to drive, so I haven't driven you know in some years, are you willing to you know couple days a week for 30 minutes. kind of go with me, and so I can get back on my feet and move out. yeah and have a talk with her. And just see. and see where that goes."
12699.0,Patient,"yeah I have mentioned it, but I can bring it up again."
324.0,Provider,"yeah so that's you know, like the thing is, if we see an effort, but look i'm trying to feel."
12699.0,Patient,mm hmm.
324.0,Provider,"down here, maybe they'll feel a little more. Have a little more I guess the word is compassion or. Less. I don't even know the word is. Less irritability because you know you talked about the group quite a bit so."
12699.0,Patient,"yeah it's one of those things they just want me to figure it out and they don't want to help me that's how i've been feeling. Because I always mentioned that i'm 3232 years old, you should be able to do this and. And it's like for some reason, like because they were able to do it and, like it automatically means. I have to figure it out, on my own and it's just like it's very frustrating because, like i'm not good at figuring things out on my own I i've never been, I have a learning disability I ADHD and it's like i've always like I always have to try and do things on my own as well."
324.0,Provider,"yeah I would have, I would just you know. let's go to lunch. and talk. yeah and. And kind of see what she says and say look, this is i'm working on trying to get out of here, you know I appreciate you guys, for you know, allowing me to come back home to get on my feet i'm trying to i'm working on it. And it's not helping my mental health. When. Knowing that you guys are angry at me for being here or upset with me being here. I want, I want to get out. You know. it's not like I just. A mom decided to quit my job and come back here just for the heck of it. Right coven yeah co what happened and. and"
12699.0,Patient,"And I always say. I spent all my money, I should have been like able to do it and save and like I know his mother was like I was really sad and lonely in my apartment and I wasn't not mentally stable so it's like. And I know it's really hard but i'll try."
324.0,Provider,"yeah and I think like a you were there before so you can get there, I don't. I have no doubts about that you can get back to where you were before. You know, it just might you know, take a little time again. get your tablet or something, and you know I don't know if you journal, if you want to join them, but I would definitely write out a plan. You know. short term goals long term goals, I do it every starting January every year."
12699.0,Patient,good idea.
324.0,Provider,"And I draw a line i've used to typing paper draw a line down the middle left or right short term right but long term, and this is what I need to do within the next few weeks, so that you know. on the right side long term, these are the things that I need to accomplish before the issue here is up. So it's not that is immediate but I need to get this done. Before the years over and then, what I do in order to you know list everything in order of importance and, as I get it done I check it off, we went to the next one check it off moving on to the next one, so I think. Trying to maybe organize it that way i'm wanting to my goal is to you know get back on my feet and move out the first step. Driving if that's what you feel is you know, one of the first things that you need to work on. write that down. You know, second thing that I need to do, and just. You know, take it from there. update delete whatever you know in and. refresh your list as needed, you know i'm saying that that is needed add to order tech oil, you know I don't need to worry about this, let me take this off the list, but I need to do this. And I mean literally before you know what that whole list will be checked off. So you can do it for sure. yeah. yeah. And you know what i'll. i'm going to send Ashley a message and. You know and she's really good about tips and. Things. You know, to help, so I think. She will also be you know good fit i'm glad, did you see her in group anyway."
12699.0,Patient,was like one on one.
324.0,Provider,"filler in on you know what's been going on, so that when you guys meet. You know that'll kind of help. The direction and. help you get to where you need need to be you were there so i've heard you can I know you can get there. huh right coven happen trust me, there are a lot of people. yeah yeah so it's not believing in that tissue."
12699.0,Patient,yeah like I said it was like the the routine my routine and my everything my mind normal my normal in my life like just. Just. It really wrecked me it was like everything I worked towards just was toppled.
324.0,Provider,"yeah and i'm going to say this being 32. There are some people that are I just say 52 that called it affected and it might be a little harder for them, you know i'm saying."
12699.0,Patient,"mm hmm yes, what I think is like I. wonder why they always bring my age and do things like."
324.0,Provider,Girls like.
12699.0,Patient,Just because i'm an adult doesn't mean i'm.

324.0,Provider,"nicely yeah you can't put me on. The phone, but over to. Probably call them and well you shouldn't have to cydia. The automated number. it's automated put the prescription number some will, I know wildly they'll do it sometime no CDs will do it, too, so that you don't have to call them every time and put the little prescription number and. they'll do it automatically, but I think you have to. sign up for."
12699.0,Patient,Your time.
324.0,Provider,"Because I know mark i'm with walgreens and they always say, do you want to do on right reveals press one or not first to whatever the estimated."
