ID,Role,Message
386.0,Provider,alrighty go ahead and give me full name and date of birth.
13689.0,Patient,Michael polly 25 1986.
386.0,Provider,"let's take a look here PA you are why. All right, Michael and you said, there was some type of dose i'm. Wrong medication was wrong."
13689.0,Patient,"When I first. Seen another doctor, he was writing mine. Well, he was right mountain runs and then Dr Cruz took them over. Okay, and and when he took them over he started me out on the same milligram as I was getting from the other doctor, which was 300 milligrams three times a day okay Well he it up and double my. neurons. They give me 600 milligrams three times a day. Well, yes, at walgreens they had a refill for my 300 milligrams when he originally started me on lows and they failed the 300 milligram and not the 600 milligram so I don't know if I didn't have another prescription of 600 or. 300."
386.0,Provider,"yeah so gather 600 milligram tablet with the directions, to take one tablet by mouth three times a day was sent in electronically on the first of September, so what I would do my. My goal is I would definitely call over to the walgreens drugstore and talk with the pharmacy technician and just say I should have a prescription on file for gabapentin 600 milligrams when, am I going to be able to pick that up."
13689.0,Patient,They didn't they said they didn't have it on file.
386.0,Provider,Use you use the word on file.
13689.0,Patient,"yeah I asked him I said look I said I said I call him this morning because I got this not yesterday, but today, before I picked my prescriptions up and I was so busy yesterday I didn't get a chance to do anything. So I called him back this morning it's almost like look I was like you build the wrong prescription I said you give me the 300 milligram game with me and. And i'm on 600 milligrams and she said, I said so on file, it should be 600 milligrams I said, this is an old prescription and she said she said on file, we do not have anything."
386.0,Provider,i'm going to double check to make sure he didn't send in like two scripts. For it. He didn't have.
13689.0,Patient,"Well, see what happened Wednesday when it came to our group they had somebody else come our prescriptions in. So. I don't know what what's going on and even like my prescriptions that have been dropped down to four times. Four day supply. Every four days to get my prescriptions. I need to figure something out with that. yeah every four days."
386.0,Provider,"I get that, let me take a look here. I will call the wall, when I call over the walgreens pharmacy I will verify why how many when you picked up the 300 milligrams how many of them were there."
13689.0,Patient,Other prescriptions down to the four times a day like i'm saying and. Then I got that one in every the full prescription so.
386.0,Provider,"That prescription, I feel, is the script that we. That was written on 825 of 2021, and so it was for quantity of 90 with zero refills and it was written on 825 but then five days later. Technically 60 days later, because there's 31 days in August, but. He sent in another prescription order for the quantity of 600 milligrams so what i'm going to probably do is just relay over to the walgreens drugstore for you, that the dose was increased to the 600 milligrams 303."
13689.0,Patient,The last time I picked up the 600 milligram tablets was on the first of September.
386.0,Provider,So you did that.
13689.0,Patient,"Yes, I think that was the beginning of September, which is a 30 day supply taken three day. So today i've got enough for today and then i'm out."
386.0,Provider,But you do have the 300 milligrams on on.
13689.0,Patient,The 300 milligram.
386.0,Provider,"alrighty I would double up on those because that's not the 300 milligrams three times a day isn't your dosing it's 600 milligrams, so I would take two 300 milligrams three times a day for you okay."
13689.0,Patient,"If you talk to the pharmacy and they will go ahead and write me a prescription 600 I will bring the 300 back to them i've had to do before. OK, I will say 300 because, like I said I got enough of the 600 to do me today. Okay let's get this taken care of I can take them the 300 milligram lunch bag."
386.0,Provider,"alrighty let me see what i'm able to do there and then in regards of your profile here, it looks like they currently have you enrolled in the opioid use disorder program as well as chronic pain. And it looks as if you are seeing on a weekly group therapy appointment frequency twice monthly for individual therapy your group assignment is on Wednesdays with ice and alexa. And the reason why the prescription is written for four days for you is because it notated here that the prescription recommendation is that. Patient no showed an appointment in the last 15 days and multiple over the last 30. The prescription is to be reduced to a four day supply with a secondary prescription to bridge until next appointment it's please instruct patient must attend 15 days without a no show for scripts to be increased. Okay. There is."
13689.0,Patient,"Even on those on those days that I missed. The last appointment that I missed I missed because my whole family head coach. we're all struggling with toby and I called in, and let them know that I was positive for covert and so was three others in my house at the time we fought code for the last month. kids and adults, we have been struggling with."
386.0,Provider,"I got four. kids for kids to adults, we just i'm literally to this is my second week back to work."
13689.0,Patient,So well yeah so you know.
386.0,Provider,"Believe me. I am the one that can relate to that um. What I would do in that circumstance, because I mean it looks like here that you checked in on 915 but just missed the appointment on 918 for individual therapy. checked in, for I mean you're checking in for group and that's I mean that's the biggest part of it, so you are checking in for group."
13689.0,Patient,"thing like Monday and Tuesday Monday I had an appointment with alexa and Tuesday and one with Dr Cruz, they cancel both of those. So their appointments, but when I came to mind."
386.0,Provider,"The they just didn't cancel your appointments is what i'm saying so, like they cancelled out the the follow up the like the. The. Those all those appointments were cancelled, but the the appointment that you had with the therapist on 90 day mark that as a no show."
13689.0,Patient,"Yes, that's the one where I call me and say look i'm sorry. The data mismatch Tomas I lost track of time. there's been so much going on in my house why I even called him that morning to verify my appointment. was going to that appointment, but. I just got so tired."
386.0,Provider,"it's understandable, what I would do in this particular case, Michael because I mean other than that this, it seems like you're pretty consistent. Other than a couple individual therapy appointments and so there, they are really focusing on individual therapy, because we do feel that individual therapy is a huge part of your recovery and so. What they are definitely they are focused on the individual therapy, so what I would do is I would log into the care navigation virtual clinic and just say look, I called and cancelled these this appointment letting you guys know that I had coven. Is there a way to get this reversed as a no show because it's affecting my prescriptions. and see what they say about it. What they'll end up doing is they'll send a message over to alexa and Isaiah Cruz requesting for the prescription the for the appointment to be marked out as a cancellation versus a no show."
13689.0,Patient,It just has to go through the.
386.0,Provider,providers authorization.
13689.0,Patient,"Okay, because yeah I feel the lex luthor definitely overrun."
386.0,Provider,muted. you're muted Mike I don't know if you can hear me it's muted.
13689.0,Patient,Sorry.
386.0,Provider,it's okay.
13689.0,Patient,"yeah, I feel that alexa will ever on that because. Prior to the one that I missed did have the appointment with her and I went yeah and my eight year old. was the first one test positive so she knew I was going through the code, but and then, when I missed her appointment by that time my eight year old, are you did her name my 12 year old bought it and. Like awake."
386.0,Provider,"it's funny because my kids are my. The first one that came into the home with coven was my seven year old and then my seven year old gave it to my 14 year old and. My 14, and so we went down the line, my girls, I have literally quarantined in their room and they have not even like been allowed anywhere they're probably going crazy at this point. But they have had no symptoms, and so I got lucky with them not getting it so."
13689.0,Patient,To.
386.0,Provider,"My four kids have been lucky enough not to get it, I don't know how it was for you guys, we have the delta variant out here i'm up in Oregon, and so we had the diarrhea the gastrointestinal."
13689.0,Patient,No.
386.0,Provider,"Okay yeah. I I told my husband I go if I didn't have kids I would have been hospitalized because it's, the only thing that kept me out of the hospital is the thought process that my kids need their mom you know that was the only thing. I could barely move like it felt like my. neck was broken in half, so I completely can relate to you guys on."
13689.0,Patient,One stand up it hurts. I didn't want to stand up.
386.0,Provider,I didn't.
13689.0,Patient,"want to get it because we might year old got it, I felt so bad for herself, but I went in there with her and. With her. And I know I was gonna get it, but I didn't want to leave it in there by yourself."
386.0,Provider,"I don't blame you I don't know I don't blame you one. bit I I. The first thing when I heard I you know when I heard, because we all my my husband and my two sons and I always tested at the same time. And the boys got their results back first, and when I finally got the boys results back, first, I was able, because I knew I tested positive on a whole test. I went to walgreens and picked up like their home test and I swapped to myself, and so I already knew that I had it. But it felt amazing to be able to hold my kids like just be able to you know I will because I didn't want to hold my I didn't want to hold my seven year old because I didn't want him to be exposed if. I if in fact I you know didn't have cove ID or if I did have co but I didn't want him to have that exposure if it wasn't if it already didn't occur so. But he's the one that brought it inside the House so."
13689.0,Patient,"yeah thanks. Man she came in school start feeling bad one day and then. We went out and I came back in one second a minute, she was feeling bad I went out and came back, I came back and she had a favor and I was like nine one emergency room. You know. I felt like well if i'm over at least i'll know for sure."
386.0,Provider,"You know what. there's no no better I mean there's no better parent to over to overreact one way or another, I mean you got the answers that you needed and you kept your family, as you know, as healthy as possible at that moment in time so good for you, for overreacting, even if it was you know I wish. I would have done the same thing."
13689.0,Patient,yeah I mean it was just bad because every every one of us thought that. It was one of.
386.0,Provider,US will.
13689.0,Patient,"be better, and then we go test again and then another one that have, and then the third time we win got casted for."
386.0,Provider,You guys have a family of four or five.
13689.0,Patient,We got five kids to those.
386.0,Provider,"Five kids to adults Oh, my goodness out. Like crazy with the for kids i'm just like i'm like quarantine is when you live in a whole ball together it's so hard."
13689.0,Patient,"We re started, I mean we got a 14 year old and a three year old so. I mean, then, we had the eight year old and then after her when the baby and he's 3035 years. in between."
386.0,Provider,"I didn't mind pretty quick, but I am I, so I wasn't going to have four kids I was only going to have three kids and my husband and I I went and got my to my tubal ligation after baby number three. But I ended up with them before still so. yeah I had, I had a baby after a tubal ligation and then, finally, I was like no 0.1% chance on this woman anymore, I want those things out so."
13689.0,Patient,She was not supposed to be able to get pregnant in my she yeah she had her cervix had become biopsy then it kept the countdown or cervix and she was supposed to have any more kids after the 12 year old man yeah day in the three year old.
386.0,Provider,"There we go, you know miracles miracles happen every single day, and you are absolutely blessed with what you know somebody some the universe planned it for you guys so. You know that it's the way it is the way it's supposed to be so let's see what we're able to get going for you, I will verify for the grab a pen. But in regards of the prescription being a four days, the reason why it is a four days is because they have marked you down as a no show they also have the prescription recommendation marked as know completed urine drug testing so just definitely get your urine drug testing done."
13689.0,Patient,"I did, who."
386.0,Provider,Did you do it already.
13689.0,Patient,last word yeah they.

13689.0,Patient,And then.

13689.0,Patient,"Okay, all right. All right, yeah. When I canceled my appointments on Monday and Tuesday also disappointed, because I know he had been on vacation for two weeks. And I scheduled it before he went out so once he went on vacation I was like well i'll be one of the first people he sees when it gets paid, and I was looking forward to both them because I missed the one with."
386.0,Provider,me to do again. I can't hear you Michael. I can't hear you. Oh sorry.
13689.0,Patient,"yeah looking forward to the appointment because, like I said I missed the lake to the appointment and when I missed it I didn't want to. And then, when I had the new appointment, which was Monday this week, I was looking forward to seeing her and then Tuesday I was gonna say Dr Cruz so. When those cancel it just kind of put me in a bind because I really needed both of them appointment, so now i'm having to reschedule and wait another three or four weeks."
386.0,Provider,"Understand yeah unfortunately he just had a family emergency and so, and then it and I know that there was a timeframe, where he wasn't able to contractually like figure out with certain insurance plans, there was a lot of insurance. issues with medications going through and so that has all been resolved at this point. Thank goodness, it was really messy but um he's just now getting back into the role of."

But in the future, I just wanted you to guys to be aware that i'm not able until that form is completed and processed i'm not able to discuss your guys's cases with each other okay. And so I just wanted to kind of relate that for you, but I have absolutely no problem calling over and talk to the pharmacy about they got a pet prescription for you, Michael.

What you can do is you can open it up fill it out for you, and then you can close out open it back up even if it's in your email and then and then have Hannah do it for vice versa, so it can be used to both."
13689.0,Patient,"yeah because it makes it easier, like the only time that we really need to use stuff like that is like when she's on the phone and she we both best something that we need to take care of. it's just easier to try to know and in one phone call rather than sit there and sign up for for two phone calls."
386.0,Provider,"Absolutely and that's understandable I would I do I do everything medical for my husband, so I I like I that's, the first thing that I asked for us i'm I can I get that. Release of information that way that way I don't have to worry about it."

13689.0,Patient,"These five ever since she started this program to get that Mr Oh, she stood up."
386.0,Provider,"it's. The only way that are my thought processes is for the visceral and i've only say something, because she i've seen her walking around here. Is that if it requires a prior authorization and it has to go through the insurance, but if it required a prior authorization and we should have been notified of a prior authorization needed so."
13689.0,Patient,I don't have it on. walgreens is terrible yeah well very this walgreens.
386.0,Provider,One is my favorite pharmacy.
13689.0,Patient,"yeah we used to have we used to have rite aid and what happened when walgreens but right now, they took over right there and but yeah we're gonna switch or pharmacies probably walmart or so. Much choices."
386.0,Provider,"I don't recommend I don't recommend moving to walk. To walmart I prefer walgreens it's really hard for me to say that because. I really like despise walgreens but I despise I despise walmart more walmart so walmart has a clause that if they're not comfortable feeling a prescription and then they don't have to. If it's written so they have like a it's. kind of like a lot of walmart pharmacist have like this power trip going on. And so, and especially when it comes to suboxone because there is a stigma on the medication in regards of. us. And so just kind of keep that in mind if if you're able to get after this after today if you're able to get the prescriptions, I would just stick with. If you're able because."
13689.0,Patient,"This slow in some ways, but yeah I mean all in all, with my medicines like they will work with my there's one lady over there that normally always try to talk to, and if she's there that's what i'll go through, because she would."
386.0,Provider,"I have my favorite pharmacist as well here in my local town, so I will I will wait for a pharmacist if I need something. So I did that."
13689.0,Patient,Thank you.
386.0,Provider,"alrighty a release of information has been sent over to your email Michael and that's for both of you, and then I will pull over to the pharmacy I will give you both a. call back once I have everything sorted. i'm sorry to hear you."
13689.0,Patient,amy. Damien Damien.
386.0,Provider,"Damien I love it, I have, I have had nine cats right now my my kids all things that they have like to each other it's kind of fantastic but i'm my mama cat had a litter of seven, and so I have more right now."
13689.0,Patient,We have 32 mini.
386.0,Provider,"me tell you I got one of those really expensive litter boxes that I feel like I need four of them i'm. Even though it scoops itself, I still need for."
13689.0,Patient,"We looked at, we looked at those."
386.0,Provider,"They do what they do work, I will say that if you have I don't. wreck I don't recommend it for multi cat use, because the cats just don't like it doesn't it does scoop every time they go to the bathroom and it's fantastic and it's literally you don't have to touch litter whatsoever. It goes into a box you. Put the cover over the box I I end up i'm OCD so what I do is I grab a garbage bag and I like just over the box throwing it out that way I don't have any like access to litter touching me. But um it is really convenient on it just really depends on how much money you want to spend on litter, because when you have multi cats you already I mean you're looking at what you're you're already spending like 20 bucks."
13689.0,Patient,Every letter.
386.0,Provider,"every other day for litter right on I buys us three packs which I believe is like 4050 bucks here on i'm in Oregon. So I by the three packs of the cat changing free phil said their boxes and then they inside the each box comes up with a package of litter, and then they put it in, and it literally will scoop it into like this little side container for me and then. You can always scoop it out of there if that's what you wanted to do it's super easy, but the letter does not I don't have any smell coming from the litter box, whatever it is like an odor free litter box like I can't smell anything um. I have kittens so my kids are potty training, so I end up with like little tiny kitten piles next to the litter box at this point, which is frustrating but. um my girls are in charge of cleaning that. up and so yeah. i'm just like oh you guys wanted the kitties you get you get to clean up after the kitties. um but I mean if if you want it, I I mean it saved me worlds of money. Because I was having to buy litter so often, and it would still stink, and so I don't have the stink anymore."
13689.0,Patient,yeah yeah my kids one I can't want animals for like the first week and then there's.
386.0,Provider,"Another one. i'm Mike I have um I can I can proudly say that I out of out of all the cats that I have, there are two that i'm really, really connected with that I just am not i'm not prepared to get rid of. My one my one mama cat she's not going anywhere that's my baby she was my cat to begin. With and it just so happened that I didn't get her fixed in time and so covert happen, and then the vets out here, shut down like I couldn't I couldn't even get my cat into for an appointment to have surgery i'm to get her fixed so i'm just stuck with kittens at this point, but. Definitely keep the cats inside while you guys are dealing with coven because I don't know if if your county told you or the health department, but um the particles code particles can actually be on. cats too."
13689.0,Patient,Oh wow. yeah yeah can they can.
386.0,Provider,They can. I don't think. They can catch I can catch it and they can spread it to other cats.
13689.0,Patient,Oh wow. Okay well enough people down there man. yeah okay anyways but.
386.0,Provider,yeah.
13689.0,Patient,I just like her good.
386.0,Provider,"yep it is proven they did that they actually did a horrible study on cats where they actually purposely exposed a cat. To cove it and then put it inside of a cage next to another cat and the other cat ended up. Getting covert as well, so they had. They did do experiments on it it's really sad to say."
13689.0,Patient,When I.
386.0,Provider,When the health department told me that I was just like well that's ridiculous and that's abuse of power is what it.
13689.0,Patient,Is animal cruelty.
386.0,Provider,"Right that's what i'm thinking um and so, but there was a study, and so it did come back and I know there's like i'm bigger felines like lions out in the news right now have tested positive for coded. Well, so. Just be you know just be aware, try to keep the cat since I don't know if you are in your cats or inside outside but try to keep them inside and then just away from anybody that's currently has co bid. alrighty but I will be in touch with you guys shortly to let you know about your prescriptions."
13689.0,Patient,"All right, I appreciate it."
386.0,Provider,"Absolutely not a problem, I hope you have a great rest your day. Start time 10:50am to 11:28am Pacific standard time patient was Mr Michael paulie date of birth, for this patient I have on file is. 525 of 1986 patient logged into the rx vc as his significant other hand, a ball had requested for me to see Mike was well. Patient reported a discrepancy in regards of medication dosing for the gabapentin patient picked up a prescription order for gabapentin 300 milligrams for quantity of 90. Just the other day or yesterday or today in regards of his medication, however, the prescription has been increased to gabapentin 600 milligrams at three times a day dosing no further action is needed at this time, start time is. This writer did discuss with the patient in regards of prescription recommendations as his prescription recommendation has been forwarded to. A four day supply, with an additional bridge to get him over to his next appointment due to scheduling for individual therapy his urine drug testing. As well as a no show to appointment patient reported that him and his family have had coven 18, therefore, that is why he hasn't been able to make some of the movements that have been scheduled, such as the. Individual therapy appointment and no further action is needed at this time, start time. This writer will call over to walgreens drugstore and verify prescription dosing and clarify prescription order for a patient no further action needed at this time, thank you."
