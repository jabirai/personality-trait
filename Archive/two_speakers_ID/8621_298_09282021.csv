8621.0,Patient,"I never get like angry and I really nor. Did. I just say. And I really never had time to communicate with my parents or like I do it's just a little small talk and I just get back to I pre K L and my chemistry homework. Okay how's your rates. So far, it's not so well I choked on the first test for pre count. I think I just froze when I was taking it by put up a lot hours into it like I was doing the word the homework is like hundred percent. I think it's just the way hi approach to the test. I always had that. The yeah I just froze like it over over it over to me, so the I guess the anxiety. Of the past the past previous of years I didn't know, I was like oh I didn't know it was like anxiety like I didn't know that that was a thing. Like it could wipe out everything for you."
298.0,Provider,yeah it's it's a real thing.
8621.0,Patient,"Yes, it does. In a way, directly impacts, the person."
298.0,Provider,mm hmm it's here.
8621.0,Patient,I got like seven in a row right which were like very long equations. But I wasn't able to skip the pub the problems that would that would take forever. Because it's on a legs it's on a program so i'm not he would skip it. So we'll see if that makes sense.
298.0,Provider,Oh yeah it does.
8621.0,Patient,"And I just ran out of time, and when they went to like 30 minutes, I was like my hard job as like just in a way, I could. I finished, all the way to 14 out of 24 so i'm like. yeah that was horrible it was really it was it was horrible it was horrible to tell you. yeah but this second test i'm approachable. My opportunity differently."
298.0,Provider,So um. Have you ever tried a medication called propranolol for testing anxiety that you take it before you're testing society take it before I test to keep you calm.
8621.0,Patient,Have you heard no no.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, I I had my doctor give me some what it is, is it's a blood pressure, medicine. And I never got the chance to use it for what the way I wanted to but everybody talks about it, and so I asked my doctor to prescribe me and. it lowers the blood pressure and calms the heart but it doesn't mess, with the mind and which is nice so you're still as teen as can be, but your body is calm and it helps with testing society. You could write it down and see what people say about it, or I can give you a couple of tablets it's it's not like a stimulant or anything like that."
8621.0,Patient,yeah no way I don't know anyone that takes a really.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, I just thought it's for anxiety when you're looking at social anxiety anxiety. how's your medicine working for you."
8621.0,Patient,"it's it's working fine like i'm able to do my work. Driving for me it's a lot easier like it's. i'm able to focus on the road it's easier for me to navigate things. don't get really lost, like, for my mind doesn't go everywhere, I guess. That makes something if I get to like new places I like. I like think everywhere so like. or on a freeway so like if I go to La it's like really hard for me, without the medication. Like navigate there. If. If I take it, I don't have any errors."
298.0,Provider,it's the dosage feel like it's at the right dosage.
8621.0,Patient,"Of. This, like, I know, wherever. I do drink a lot of water and makes a drink of water. Okay yeah that makes sense. I don't know what's like the feeling like I watched one video how you're supposed to like. know if it's like the right. amount. For a person wasn't able to. grass really it was like very confusing."
298.0,Provider,"yeah I haven't I haven't seen that video, it would be interesting for me to watch it to see you know myself what it looked like. i'm. Would So do you think we should stay at this dosage."
8621.0,Patient,what's like a sign that it's like too much.
298.0,Provider,Your heart would be racing what you would feel a crash after you after it's burned out of the system you'd feel a real crash in your mood.
8621.0,Patient,Okay yeah stick to 10. Okay yeah.
298.0,Provider,"All right, well do. me any depression any suicidal thoughts homicidal thought."

8621.0,Patient,Oh yeah they increases in along.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, do you have any other questions for me."
8621.0,Patient,I was thinking. Of like my bands. it's like a. is another like a little bit lighter I guess or it's like it's a different structure right. It is a long lasting stimulant.
298.0,Provider,"yeah and I would be happy to do by fans if you remind me in group so i'm giving you a two week supply right now. And if you remind me and group that you would like to try, by Vance by Vance is a. Cleaner for the body but it's a lot more expensive and your insurance doesn't like to pay for it. If what we could. Do is in group reminds me that you wanted to try, by Vance, then we could start I could put the prescription in. Once you pick up your medication, then I put in the prescription of I dance, and then we don't have. A lag have you been out of medicine, while we're waiting for the prior authorization does that make sense."
8621.0,Patient,Okay.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so it, you know I I liked the idea you've done well on adderall so it would be good to try, by Vance."
8621.0,Patient,"yeah um. yeah it's long what I heard is like long lasting and it's like. mean you came out not that long ago, really. Okay. i'm gonna assume it's this should be more efficient."
298.0,Provider,yeah.
8621.0,Patient,I think so.
298.0,Provider,"I think it is more efficient so. um so that let's go with that plan then we'll look at five Vance. Next time, I see you and and then right pick up your script and then you'll have a time period that we can get the prior authorization done."
8621.0,Patient,What will be the milligrams of it.
298.0,Provider,VI Vance top milligram I believe is 70 milligrams and you're on so it would be probably somewhere around 40 milligrams we give you 3040 to see where you know you would respond best to.
8621.0,Patient,"Oh, I think dirty."
298.0,Provider,"yeah we can definitely try 30 cents that's a good a good for you, when it comes to buy vans but we'll see when we. When we actually get paid for. yeah."
8621.0,Patient,Oh yeah like to try that and he's it. just say. Okay.
298.0,Provider,Okay i'll just give you a couple tablets i'll give you like five tablets and. When you know that you have some sort of anxiety take one and see if it helps and then let me know if it helps or not.
8621.0,Patient,Okay.
298.0,Provider,And it should calm your heart rate down calm your blood pressure down don't jump up and run a marathon after taking a dose of them because they are just don't jump up because you're already when you jump when you get up you lower your blood pressure so.
8621.0,Patient,It shouldn't.
298.0,Provider,"It shouldn't be a problem, but I just tell people that if you feel like when, if you jump up really fast and you feel like you're a little dizzy it's the medicine. A lot of people it doesn't even do that too. And so i'm sending over. i'm sending over five tablets. All right."
8621.0,Patient,That will be interesting to.
298.0,Provider,"yeah. it's not hard on the body at all, no not hard all right, I need to tell Francisco good luck and keep me posted okay."
8621.0,Patient,Thank you so tell. me do you.
