8625.0,Patient,"i'm doing Okay, how are you."
383.0,Provider,i'm doing fine it's cooler you know that's really nice it feels good. We had like last night so. That was that was special you know after fires and. The State burning and it feels really good that cold and. yeah and yeah.
8625.0,Patient,"We had a yeah I feel like the weather, has been so weird because it was like actually getting chilly last week and then all of a sudden, like Friday Saturday, it was really hot and hot wins and. And then, all of a sudden, it was cold again and it rained here last night, too, so I don't know. Where weird but anyways so but yes, I definitely the. The atmosphere I don't know changes when it starts to get cool and I don't know I it feels Nice."
383.0,Provider,"job I was gonna ask you, what is your relationship to the season, or do you have good you know feelings about it, or how is it for you to be in in fall."
8625.0,Patient,"um I like it usually is kind of I personally don't like that, when it gets really cold but. I but I liked the time of year because it feels it has kind of like a nostalgic feeling to it, or something I don't know. Like you know thanksgiving and you know it's like kind of when the holidays start happening, and even though. we've never really been a family that like goes all out for the holidays it's still has a nostalgic feeling for me sort of. I enjoy it."
383.0,Provider,that's good.
8625.0,Patient,yeah.
383.0,Provider,"yeah it is so many there's so many layers to the holidays and to you know the time of year and. All the good the good experiences and then there's sometimes there's loss, you know, because these things and we've lost people such as you know, maybe you're another holiday without a particular family member. Right, he kind of tough but then there's all the good memories and you know so we're just I think it's. it's can be better bittersweet."
8625.0,Patient,"yeah definitely I like I started cooking thanksgiving dinner a couple years ago and I really liked doing that I like cooking. i'm not like you know the greatest cook or anything but like I I enjoy. doing it, and so I think you know I don't know for sure if i'm going to be doing the thanksgiving cooking this year but i'm. Looking forward to it, if I am we were talking about it last night because, last night I cook dinner. And I made like a butter for the steaks that I made. I put. Garlic and seasoning in it and I had never done that, before and it turned out good and my aunt was like you should put this in Turkey when you. Do the Turkey but. I do something else when i've done the Turkey so anyways it just kind of made me think of. yeah cooking thanksgiving dinner that i'm looking forward to that."
383.0,Provider,uh huh. Nice.
8625.0,Patient,yeah.
383.0,Provider,"So um What did you did you want to focus on something in particular today. or just kind of. Just an overall check in about how things have been doing, you want to give me. Just. A few of hype and doing this past month."
8625.0,Patient,"yeah I think um i've been doing okay I you know I had like a little bit of a you know I had been feeling super low mood and then I kind of had like a random. bursts of motivation and energy and then that kind of went away again. Which is that I feel like yeah that's just kind of like a. Regular cycle for me where i'm like you know, like most the time i'll be kind of. feel like i'm you know honestly kind of like struggling with mood and whatever and then randomly i'll be like okay you got this and you know and i'll be able to do suffer usually about like a week. And then kind of dips again and. But so yeah I kind of been feeling like i'm ended that motivation cycle and i'm still kind of. Maybe not as low mood, as I was before, but still kind of just you know, like today i'm feeling kind of tired and. You know I keep a big thing that regularly comes up for me is. Not being. satisfied with what i'm doing for work and. i've had these moments of like clarity, where i'm like. Telling myself, you know i've had actually some pretty clear moments over the last month, I would say, where I have been like. I shouldn't be a lawyer anymore, because if it's this like if i'm struggling this much with it, why am I, continuing to try to push myself to do it. And I even had a talk with my mom about it, and she was like yeah I mean there's no reason for you to keep trying to push yourself to do something that you don't. Really you're not really like enjoying or you know, whatever and then, but then I have the same. Like I don't know I feel like i'm having this struggle, right now, of. Trying to listen to myself more you know and not listen to like outside influences. And, but it scares me. Because i've never really done that, before. So when I have like this, I have you know, like a super clear moment of. You know what i'm just going to accept that I don't like being an attorney I don't want to do this anymore and i'm gonna figure out something else to do and that's what i'm going to do and it's like a super clear moment. And then I start like doubting well you know I well I went to school for all this time, and like you know I feel like I should give it more of a chance, and you know what's it going to look like, if I don't. keep doing it and. And what am I going to do if I don't keep doing it and those like I don't know."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8625.0,Patient,"So I feel like that's been honestly for since I started practicing law that's been a reoccurring thing that I just don't like it and I keep doing it one because I don't know what else i'm going to do, and to because. You know i'm afraid to not do that, since I put so much effort into it."
383.0,Provider,"Right right. um. Have you do, you have brainstorming ideas around what you would like to do."
8625.0,Patient,"Well um I have thought about. Going and teaching in China again i've done that, before and I, like the, the only reason it appeals to me, is because I like the lifestyle of it, where I have more free time i'm able to make money and still survive. and save money and when i'm not working, I can travel and you know cuz so I really keep kind of going back to possibly doing that. But the only reason I haven't is because i'm trying to not be so like. I like I don't want to just be like running or escaping you know what I mean but i've been trying to like process it more, rather than just saying this is what i'm going to do and do it without really giving it some thought."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8625.0,Patient,"Others, other than that i'm like you know i've thought about well what if I What if I go back to working in the veterinary field like I like animals and. But you can't really make good money do like I just have all these like thoughts of like you know I want to be like independent and I don't want to live at home anymore. and You know I need to make money to survive, but it's almost impossible to do here with the. You know, unless you have like a professional career. And even then, right now, because I have my own business. i'm not making the kind of money that you know, an attorney normally makes. anyways so I don't know."
383.0,Provider,"Well, I just first of all, just want to. acknowledge the difficulty of the struggle, you know that it's not a. insignificant or small, you know it's a it's kind of a big deal, you know to. feel. kind of unhappy with your professional. You know choice of occupation and then trying to solve the problem of what am I going to do you know what would I like to do, I mean in terms of. time spent probably mulling over this and thinking about it, I imagine you're thinking about it a lot and then it's on your mind a lot, and this that's kind of wearing and stressful. yeah have it that these you know these sort of big big things on your plate that you're trying to come to terms with. So I think that's emotionally and mentally stressful this this kind of questioning. So I just want to acknowledge that. The other because it, you know, whatever choice you make you know it's. it's really is kind of pivotal in terms of where your life is headed and. So it's not like yeah so it's it's it's a big question and then, when you make the decision it's a relatively it's a pretty pretty big decision let's say if you decided to go to China, you know. That would that would put your life in a particular in a particular direction and you really are family and. You know I don't know how you feel about that at this particular point in time after you know, do you want to speak to that maybe a little bit, if we look at that particular scenario, a little bit more in depth."
8625.0,Patient,"yeah that has definitely been a consideration where it's kind of like when I did it, you know a few years ago, before law school, it was. yeah a completely different. scenario for. me and my family and. yeah I feel like. One of my hesitations with it is yeah kind of not being. around like I you know I like I feel that's yeah that's a big part of why I haven't done it because. You know, ideally, I would like it, that I am doing something as easy as teaching in China. And, but doing it here, you know, like that would be ideal where you know, but the reason. I don't you know, want to get my teaching credential or anything for here is because one I don't want to go back to school to all my friends that are teachers as a whole, other shit show and. You know I don't want to get involved in that either. Because I know it's like yeah the stuff that my teacher friends tell me i'm just like yeah it doesn't make me want to do that at all. anyways the family thing is definitely a big consideration, but I have also thought about the fact that if I was doing that I would have the financial ability and time to come back and visit for either summers or winters. You know I would be gone, most of the time, but I would be at least able to come and visit once a year, if I wanted to."
383.0,Provider,"mm hmm. um. and So would that mean that you would put your your legal. basis would you keep your license or i'm not sure how that that works, would you keep it would you try to keep it. alive, or you know just."
8625.0,Patient,"yeah I would probably I mean I haven't I didn't think about that yet, but um. I would you know you can keep it an inactive status and."
383.0,Provider,Right right.
8625.0,Patient,"um or I could keep it in yeah active. that's The other thing too is like. You know there's still the potential for like. I don't know. doing some type of like I have a friend who's in China, right now, who has like a legal background they're not an attorney but. And they're actually from Mexico, but they are in China, right now, and part of what they're doing is like doing scholarly writing for the university that they're working at and it's like international law kind of scholarly writing and. and getting paid to do it. And that sounds cool to me like using the legal aspect in a different kind of you know more scholarly way. Because yeah so."
383.0,Provider,"So if you did something like that, where you're engaged in your you know, in the in the legal profession, in a sense."
8625.0,Patient,mm hmm.
383.0,Provider,"And the that's very different than going and being with children, I imagine you're teaching teaching English to children are teaching English to adults."
8625.0,Patient,"I was teaching English to first year university students, so they were like 18 you know yeah like 18 year old."
383.0,Provider,"I see I see. And that that person to person face to face engagement that kind of work, whereas the other kind of work, you just described sounds like more of like you're at your desk you're you know, maybe you go to a workplace but you're really diving into research, rather than engaging with people. Right what feels good to you right now and just because you did something that one other time, you know. it's like just just asking yourself what what does that does that feel good to think about that, like well I feel my drawn to that it's kind of like we're working with your intuition, I think, to kind of wait when you talked earlier about you know. That you are, you know inquire asking yourself that's really up to me and employing intuition for."
8625.0,Patient,Guidance mm hmm.
383.0,Provider,"And intuition, is a good thing you know can really lead us sort of our it can be like a soul call you know cuts kind of like following our soul. call you know."
8625.0,Patient,"yeah I think that one of the things that i'm struggling with right now is. Really, even learning. What it is that I really am drawn to are called to do, because I feel like in the past, I never. Like I feel like I don't know I don't know what I like and what i'm drawn to I feel like it's something that i'm. Trying to discover at this point in my life, which is also stressing me out because. Everything that. I had done in the past was kind of like what I was supposed to do you know kind of that typical path of like I did well in school, then I went to college and did well in college and then I. Okay, but what like none of that like and, yes, I did pursue you know, like subjects that I enjoyed and stuff in college, but the main focus was like doing well, it wasn't like more of a you know what's my calling kind of. You know I, there are some things that i'm like yes, I know I like this. But. uh yeah it's I don't end it's exhausting i'm just tired of it being this ongoing thing i'm just i'm tired of it and there's a part of me that wants to just say screw it i'm going to go work at a coffee shop like seriously, it sounds you know, but something that's just not so like. Like difficult. You know right."
383.0,Provider,"Right right right, yes, have you worked at a coffee shop. Yes, okay."
8625.0,Patient,"I in college, I worked at a coffee shop and like you know yeah it was like every industry has an annoying things that you deal with, but like it's also kind of like just a methodical like assembly line. thing you know we're like yeah there's that's another reason i'm like. yeah Maybe I should go work with for the vet again because I don't have to like think about. i'm not the one in charge i'm just doing the things I need to do and. I don't like."
383.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah I i'm. Well, and then you know so just back you know periodically, I think it is good to say you know, to acknowledge that this is stressful. The. The conversation with yourself the you know sort of repeated circling around this. yeah and it is worthwhile because, as you navigate as you slowly, you know one step at a time well I think i'll do this, and this seems, you know as you over time. you'll look back and see Okay, it was. At least this is what I experienced in my life because i've done a lot of of what you're doing. That when I look back, I see I made I made choices that were ultimately in my best interest for the long haul you know, even though in that moment, you know there were definitely. It was difficult to be in the trenches you know whether it was in the trenches of studying things I just didn't think that I was you know just different things so. It is, it is worth it sort of this work that you're doing right now to try to. articulate and find out, you know what is because you have different needs you're you're you're you're trying to address you know you're not just you're not just trying to address the needs of your soul and your you know what is your. What is going to be meaningful work for you, which I think that's important you know that's important down the road you know and through through our life, you know. meaningful work and but you're also trying to thinking about work life balance and you're thinking about you know you don't just want to be grind at the job you know all day."
8625.0,Patient,In.
383.0,Provider,"And then you're also thinking about. Your financial needs that you have those to meet you know as as an independent person. So that's that's a lot of that's a stretch, you know, to try to get all those targets sure you can hit the target of going to the coffee shop and getting that kind of job which will not hit meet the needs of your financial needs. It will create generally dependence, because those kinds of jobs just don't I mean that just."
8625.0,Patient,An America right.
383.0,Provider,"it's just. it's like it's it's rough you know. And if you know, certainly, they have. I don't see that as really an option for you. Unless you're willing to like live in. You know the. Very you know the least expensive apartments in an area, you know, unless you have another source of resources, you know. Right from your family that can help support that kind of lifestyle, but. Is there is there any kind of law that you are, I mean there's so much advocacy right now. I was just listening to the most interesting interview about a lawyer who he said he's a human rights advocate advocacy lawyer and then he also worked he worked on this case in Ecuador, this was a fascinating interview, and he worked on a case in Ecuador, where he found out that. There was all these this is huge like oil spill damage from Chevron what used to be, Texaco before Texaco merge with Chevron and then. So there was a lawsuit regarding all of that damage and he went down there and kind of represented the Ecuadorian people and and. And anyway it's turned into like it's just turned into a debacle where he's he's like I mean it's not right now he's in turmoil because it's on house arrest in New York and he and. The legal system is sort of turned against him and there's a corporate like text Chevron as a corporation is. manipulate the heck out of the system to try to to try to not to get out of paying back paying for the reparations of all of this environmental damage the top and so. anyway. there's i'm you know is inspiring to hear his. of you know that there was a legal there's lawyers out there that are really trying to to stand up for what's what's right and. And I don't know there's there's just that's what inspired it that inspires me and the legal profession, you know the take on, you know these really fully fully ish."
8625.0,Patient,"yeah no definitely that kind of stuff inspires me as well. But. I guess like my dilemma is it. really like. I think so it's just it's difficult. Like being an attorney is difficult, and on top of it. I have the issue of not. feeling confident enough in myself to wear when I do like like, for example, you know the kind of law that i'm doing right now, where I just constantly am trying to like. find information to, can you know, to make sure i'm correct because i'm so worried it's like a lot of pressure to. it's like i'm advising someone on something and I don't feel confident in it like it, because what if i'm wrong, and then they do this thing and there's this consequence. For someone else because I didn't properly advise them or didn't you know it's like it's a lot and I think that's what I don't really like about it is like constantly. feeling stressed and something like that, where it's like this super like you know, like yeah inspiring and admirable like. I don't know if it's just those attorneys have a different confidence level which is probably the case. But it's yeah I don't know I think that's the part about it that I don't like to is, I feel like I don't know if I want to work that hard like. You know it, because it's yeah it's exhausting. Doing that like trying to figure out the answer."
383.0,Provider,"Right right. and i'm just thinking what what are your thoughts on working for a firm, that is where you kind of join with others, and you kind of work together on a project that is what were your thoughts on that."
8625.0,Patient,"Well, when I first started working as an attorney I did work for a firm and it was not a good experience at all and which is probably you know part of why I feel the way I feel but. yeah it wasn't a good experience at all, I was doing the same thing, where I was just being thrown these like path that were a mix of attorney stuff and like you know assistant type stuff and. I had no guidance like you know the kind of thing where like. The first time I had gone on in front of a judge the judge like yelled at me, and when I came because I did something wrong because I had no guidance on it when I came back to the office they were like well you know that's just how you learn. But it was something where it's like but I didn't have to be yelled at by a judge in front of my client and you know if it was just the simple thing that someone could have guided me on and. My attorney friend that's kind of he's been kind of a mentor for me. You know, because i've talked to him a little bit about this too, and he thinks I need to just find an area of law, but a different area of law. and he's like you know he's like you also just, unfortunately. The timing of everything in your. Experience he's like you know you worked for firmware and he knows these attorneys that I worked for that's how I met him. he's like you know, unfortunately, you had a bad experience for like your first year of practice then your second year of practice like you know it's been the pandemic and you're you know you kind of just did this area of law because that's what you sort of knew and. But then when I keep I tell him. You know I i'm like he's like you should do wage an hour law, you should do wage an hour it's a pretty straightforward simple area of law and i'm like okay i'm open to it, but can we do he talks about us running cases together all the time, but then he never. He never does like he'll get a case he's been very like a mentor and talks to me it talks to me about all this stuff But then when it comes down to it, like kill get a case and then it's like doesn't work it with me at all doesn't offer it to me at all. So and i've been talking to this other young attorney that he's kind of helped out as well, and he was like yeah monty's never going to give you the. he's like he did he would say the same thing to me where he would like you know help me on a case or whatever, and he never he never does it and. And so i'm like all right well as Monty all talk and isn't gonna cuz that's the thing with going into a new area of law is you're not supposed to just like jump into it, not knowing how to do it. cuz that's like part of the ethics rules and stuff it's like you know if you're not competent in that area of law you're not supposed to. be advising people on it. Right um. So that's why i've told Monty well you know if you get a wage in our case, like let me work it with you, so that I can like kind of learn and see. You know so anyways long winded the whole thing about. working for a firm, as I feel like I sort of have a little bit of that with the solo attorneys that are in the same building. Where i've made a couple of appearances for another attorney in the bill like another solo attorney and like. That there's like work I could you know do with for another attorney where it's kind of like they're contracting work out for me and. around me. And yeah the idea of working in a firm, again, I guess, because of my bad experience makes me really nervous and. i've heard from other people. That I know who are currently working in firms or whatever it kind of just seemed like that's just how it is, which I don't understand why that's how it is, but. It just seems like attorneys just. I don't know what it is honestly I don't know."
383.0,Provider,"it's probably related you know, like everything else somewhat related to the person, you know if you connect with a person who is generous and and. and wants to help and supportive or a firm that has those kinds of values, where they really want to mentor you know, the new folks coming in, and they have. You know those kind of underlying. goals for how they're going to run their their life and their and their business. and So it. It does seem like. it's a complex problem if you wanted to switch from you know go into environmental law is that I mean that's like basically you'd have to something that you didn't i'm just pulling out of a hat, I mean it could be. It could be anything but you'd have to spend time learning about that kind of. right on and and you might. As. well. Do you do you do, you find yourself spending time thinking about what what other kind of log that I practice or or do you just find yourself spending more time just thinking about shutting this down completely and going in another direction."
8625.0,Patient,"Just I probably spend more time. Thinking about just not doing it at all, but like I do you know in this like cyclical frickin thought process that i'm always thinking about I occasionally it's like okay well what area of law, could I do the different you know. yeah because occasionally i'll have these moments where i'm like all right i'm just gonna. stick with doing law and, like let's figure out how I can make this more of something that's like enjoyable and that I feel passionately about or you know. So yeah occasionally, I do have those thoughts, but most of the time i'm just you know how can I do something different."
383.0,Provider,"mm hmm. I mean, it seems to me that if you are you or anyone is driven by the cause and passionate about the cause that you're willing to endure. The drudgery of the hard work."
8625.0,Patient,That may be.
383.0,Provider,"And you may not be so I think that's an important question to ask, even if you were super inspired and about the area of law that you would be doing, would you be willing. To go through the. sort of the drudgery of. Of the hard work involved would it be enough for you to be inspired about the cause to go through all of the."
8625.0,Patient,"it's. hard to say. I don't know because I haven't. worked in an area of law that I don't that I feel super inspired by I feel like. likely, yes, but. I don't know because I don't know if my like. I don't know if what i'm wanting is. Like. I want to do something that's fulfilling but I don't. I still don't think I want to work super hard for it because I feel like that could be exhausting to you know, like, even if it was something that was. I was driven by the cause. You know I can first see myself getting like emotionally exhausted. I don't know."
383.0,Provider,"Well, your energy is your you know your energy is yours, and you can make a choice as to. How you're going to to to expand that in life. And some things are going to drain drain a lot out of you, you know let's say you did want you had I don't know I think about like the migrants of the better like. Legal stuff related to immigrants, and you know that the just the struggles at the border, and all of you know there's so much need for legal representation and different kinds of areas, you know whether it's that or a child welfare. That. You know, it would likely have an energetic drain, but that would be. worth it, I mean. Some people like that you know they weren't want to be like exhausted and feel like okay I just poured my heart into this work it's really for the good of. humanity and i'm exhausted and I don't really have anything left for myself and but that's Okay, but that's a choice you know you but you do have that choice to not do that. yeah what more of my life needs to be. For some for my. enrichment and my energy needs to kind of own need to conserve it I don't want to be emotionally drained by all of these you know kinds of things and I, you know just want just a less of a stressful life and that's the kind of life that I want."
8625.0,Patient,"yeah I I think i'm more of. I don't know I think when I was younger I was more into like. Putting in the energy for others. More than myself, which I think was also kind of my issues with codependency as well. But I think recently i've been more like I you know I really just want to have like a. Stress free life. Like as little stress as possible. yeah I think."
383.0,Provider,"that's really important, if you have come if you, you know as you're muddling through this and that you come that you may be right that on a whiteboard or really I don't want to have a very you know I want more of a stress free lifestyle."
8625.0,Patient,mm hmm.
383.0,Provider,that's what I really want. So. Now things need to fall in place under that and i'm willing to sacrifice maybe i'm not going to be making that much money like you know I mean i'm not.
8625.0,Patient,Going right.
383.0,Provider,"What a tourney makes which could be quite a bit you know, even if you're working for you know good causes, you can still make probably pretty good money. And you're going to there'll be some compromises in order to have that lifestyle."
8625.0,Patient,yeah.
383.0,Provider,"But that's your overarching goal that that is more of a lifestyle that you want, then this other kind of lifestyle."
8625.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I think I think that is for sure, something I am I. it's a solid knowing for me right now is that. That is. So yeah I guess I haven't really like thought of okay that's the overarching thing now how do I fit. You know how do I find something that fits into that."
383.0,Provider,"Whether it's working part time as an attorney and you're just you know you're just you're going to build your confidence as you go, but you know it's just going to be kind of maybe you do some work on the side, maybe you know. But these other options like maybe China is it, but you know you don't want you want to live a stress more stress free type of life and you want to conserve your energy for yourself. To pursue just even your own you know. Self care, you know when there's absolutely nothing wrong with that you know, having the energy to go to to do different things that you enjoy and or maybe personal personal hobby whether it's a hobby or whether it's like you want to run triathlons or something like that. You want a energy for that."
8625.0,Patient,"Also, you know it's, not that I don't ever want to do something for other people ever again it's just more of I feel like you know, like one time, when I was doing this. Like meditation thing talking about like you know filling your cup before you can fill and I feel like i've always done it the other way.
