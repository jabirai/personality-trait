13620.0,Patient,"Well, I mean I as cliche as it sounds, I just think that i've had a restless nature and I didn't realize that there was like a medical way to approach that into. manage those things, and so i've just been going to the group therapy things you guys have and then trying to manage it that way, but, basically, I think I have some form of like add or something but it's been affected me previously. Okay recent times."
527.0,Provider,Okay yeah have you been diagnosed with with attention problems in the past.
13620.0,Patient,"No, but I can just recollecting."
527.0,Provider,As a kid in.
13620.0,Patient,"My to get all the signs and my teacher was telling me to stop drumming on the table on the drummer snail like it just weird things I would do like just always fidgety because it's still. A problem school and had horrible GPA. So, just like the. i'm sure i'm sure to a degree, I had it but. Right now, I got my caffeine i'm fine now. But because I was, I was all over the place."
527.0,Provider,yeah So what do you feel like you want to focus on as far as our. sessions or or you know treatment goals you want to focus on individually.
13620.0,Patient,"um to be fair, I i've been kind of going through like this, like tunnel with. With bright heart and so it's been kind of like just going to meetings and seeing what I guess what it's about. Things like my I had an initial meeting with a therapist and he kind of just asked me some questions. recorded them. And I think he sent it off to the next person, but as far as like therapy and stuff. i've never been to therapy so that's there's that and then simultaneously, I also want to. I guess declutter my mind and then also just like obviously comply with what bright heart needs me to do to just further myself in a. recovery or whatever you guys would call it. yeah so as far as like what we were talking about i'm not a professional, like you, but. yeah."
527.0,Provider,"yeah what, what do you feel like is like, if you had to like categorize or you know prioritize the declutter. What do you feel like you want to kind of start with like and work your way like do you have like a list of things that. That you that have you know more bother some than others is."
13620.0,Patient,"I mean just being candid here um it's. Like it's, to the point to where like I swam slowly sleep at night. Okay, because my brains can't turn off, which then affects like my obviously my sleeping which involves me into the next day i'm kind of affects how I interact with people and how my general. Like mood is and i've been realizing that about myself. So I think it's important to like for me to actively try to manage it. and go these kinds of things and just talk about it because I don't have anyone else talk about it with. Okay um and, obviously, like as a do you don't really have too many people to talk to you about those kinds of things so. But yeah I think that and then also just. Trying to manage. myself in a way to like maintain more stable relationships, you know. that's that's been like up and down in my life."
527.0,Provider,So okay yeah I was gonna ask if you had much of a support system around you.
13620.0,Patient,"I mean I don't want to have like a couple close guy friends. Okay um. But yeah to be straight we don't really talk too much about those kinds of things, because you know you. can go to hang out you don't go to be like a negative Nancy."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah How would you rate your mood at this point, do you feel like it's more do you feel like you're kind of having some ups and downs just depression, anxiety just irritability."
13620.0,Patient,"or now just baseline i'm a little bit tired so takes like sometimes I drink coffee, it makes me a little bit more tired, but at least it brings me to like a calmer level, I can actually articulate what I want to say. Okay, whoever else. yeah I think around baseline not like really sad or happy just kind of like floating in the middle."
527.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, where do you feel like you'd like to be like with therapy."
13620.0,Patient,I would like to feel a. Like I want to be able to have like clear thought and. I feel like there's a lot of frustration that can get pent up well I can't like articulate well on to say to someone. or dislike say someone will tell me something always remember like the words that they say I don't actually absorb what they're saying to me.
527.0,Provider,Okay.
13620.0,Patient,So they actually affect me pretty adversely at my prior job but. Just like little things like that and trying to just build better ways to be a better human.
527.0,Provider,"yeah so tell me what kind of work you do, and you said you're starting a new job or in transition of a new job."
13620.0,Patient,"Though yeah I spent a little bit of time in in custody and like forever sheriff's office I used to work for. Okay, and doing that for a short time and then now i'm just doing part time work with my father he's a construction worker. Okay i'm pursuing videography cinematography pretty hard right now so okay. that's what i'm getting after now sounds a little bit idealistic, but I won't be my own boss i'm not gonna let. Tell me, where I can again be so."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah so are you in school, right now, or just."
13620.0,Patient,i'm not school just working. I will go back to school.
527.0,Provider,yeah.
13620.0,Patient,yep yep.
527.0,Provider,Okay well what questions do you have for me.
13620.0,Patient,"Well, I mean I just think they just scheduled these appointments and so I show up to them, I want to like. there's I want to comply with everything they have, and I want to like obviously show initiative i'm trying to. get their opinion things like that, but some changes Lee I don't always come to these things, the most prepared so. And i've also never been in therapy so i'm kind of like also figuring that out so. Okay, I was right now. there's not like a mental health crisis or anything like that i'm not going."
527.0,Provider,"OK OK, no suicidal thoughts or homicidal thoughts are so far. Okay yeah so if we had to start kind of D cluttering thoughts, because you mentioned that you sometimes have trouble sleeping now do you get to sleep. Or do you have trouble getting to sleep because of all the thoughts that kind of seem they seem like they're racing at times for you like to shut your brain off to go to sleep or."
13620.0,Patient,"yeah and I know it's not related to caffeine, because even when i'm like calm my brain is kind of always working on overdrive. And yeah It is affecting my sleep and. i've talked to you a couple people who have had this diagnosis like who actually have ADHD and not just like yeah I want the medication for it, so I can be. down on basically crack, but they were saying to me like they felt like when they were going through therapy they actually had like a baseline calmness. Okay, and I think that's what i'm really after is I just I don't want to be. I just saw my sleep affected I don't want like my mood always like dependent on. You know the little amount of energy, I give myself. Okay you're asleep. yeah I think that's the biggest thing right now. Okay card."
527.0,Provider,um are you on any psychiatric medications right now. No okay.
13620.0,Patient,just go.
527.0,Provider,"Okay, have you ever been on medications before. Okay. yeah so it sounds like is it Isaiah that you see for medication."
13620.0,Patient,he's been on vacation apparently so I haven't really. talked with him.
527.0,Provider,Okay yeah.
13620.0,Patient,"More recently, but i've just been going to the little group therapy session."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, have you had a one on one appointment with him to talk about like your symptoms and you know exploring possible medications or trying trying medications."
13620.0,Patient,"yeah we I think that's what our next. Okay next go around will be and so i've just been. Maintaining the other like showing my appointments and whatnot. Okay, but."
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah because it sounds like having a good discussion about options or you know what his thoughts are as far as diagnosis and symptoms and things like that might be helpful because it sounds like you've had some problems even going way back to grade school and stuff.
13620.0,Patient,"yeah and like simultaneously when I when we first started meeting I asked them we kind of started talking a little bit, and I would just I wanted to try the whole. One on one like group therapy, to see if I talking about what help out or. Just being the products of others who have other like mental struggles, some of them are like little bit more advanced than nine but. it's been helping for sure so. Yes, whites we'll see where it goes I. talked to my doctor and see if that's a. route that I need to take, but."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
13620.0,Patient,So that will. Sure sure.
527.0,Provider,"yeah so tell me what tell me what happens with with relationships, because you said, sometimes you know difficulty maintaining um you know what to say how how to save things that kind of stuff. What do you think gets in the way."
13620.0,Patient,"i'm To be honest, I I get like I learned things quickly that I get bored of them. and fortunately. I think that was something I learned from a young age. And in adulthood you obviously got to maintain your composure and you can't just leave relationships, because they're not. Like. I guess how you perceive them initially like my. My former girlfriend, for example, I she was a pretty pretty good woman. And I recognize that till after the fact, but. I like his history of like making great friends with great reputable people will be friends for a short time and then i'll get busy and i'll get like. Whatever I just want to go on loner ville and i'll just like hanging out by myself and i'll hang out my friends so that's what I mean by that. And then. yeah obviously there you have like. With women and stuff I gotta be a little bit more intentional about those kinds of relationships, Chris I don't have to have a history with them. that's in Canada."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, so, so what would your friends and girlfriends say you know. I just like that that."
13620.0,Patient,"You just told me I zone out. Okay i'm gonna try my best to pay attention to what. they're saying, but I always felt like anytime I spend time with my girlfriend city at the time. Okay, like we would go to the mountains, to go hiking we would go fishing, whatever we do. Okay, but like the whole time i'm just like absent, you know, like she would talk to me and just like you wouldn't like. You know wouldn't compute."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, and."
13620.0,Patient,"I always felt like I was distracted like thinking about something else or thinking about something that I did like. Two weeks ago, at work or did something in or something that's going to come, and so I never felt like I could ever be fully present with any of the relationships i've been in."
527.0,Provider,Okay okay yeah So is there anything in particular that you'd be thinking about like when you were.
13620.0,Patient,cheese.
527.0,Provider,or things that kind of have like keep coming back that you keep thinking about like any patterns to to those destructive thoughts.
13620.0,Patient,"I mean, I think I learned it as a kid because i'd always zone out. kinda like that was like my like, if I could exist in my head I won't have to exist with what's going on around me."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
13620.0,Patient,"So I kind of just learned two things this in my head. As a kid so maybe that's learn that bad habit, even though there's nothing like an entirely going wrong in that moment of hanging out and go hiking or whatever. Sure, so this just I guess about what i've learned and need to work on."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, so what was life like growing up them that you felt like you could just kind of wanted to live in your head."
13620.0,Patient,"I. I grew up in a family like we would always do all kinds of. Like action sports I can weekend, as always, you know riding dirt bikes at local tracks with my my brother. And my dad invested in us and that way. But we had like I had all these things always opportunities and like we're always doing like one thing after another, it was always like on this constant. Like wakeboarding surfing dirt bike riding all these things, it was always like this constant high of like. You know, like all these adrenaline rushes. Okay, there was that and then also had like I think a rougher relationship with my father growing up to and setting some of that you know, like made me. kind of. feel a bit more of a problem you know in school. Okay, looking back so."
527.0,Provider,yeah well how would you describe your relationship with your dad then.
13620.0,Patient,"city. Okay i'm. Sorry, I mean he's. Bad language men say."
527.0,Provider,That hey you're being honest.
13620.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah it was it was just a little bit rougher over time, but you know, ultimately, I adore now I don't reflect too deeply on those things now."
527.0,Provider,where's your relationship now with your dad.
13620.0,Patient,it's normal it's like you know adult. Say that say the best. yeah yeah chosen i've chosen to like. pursue better things in my life and go to church and. You know I seek God out. and try to rectify those like no more issues my life to. remain in totality I guess not always doing on them and pissed off.
527.0,Provider,Sir sure. yeah. So maybe maybe one of the areas to for us to kind of focus on and give some direction is. For you do you go by Michael or do you go by Mike or does.
13620.0,Patient,doesn't matter. doesn't matter.
527.0,Provider,"Okay, you know if you had a preference. It what what would What would it be like to maybe sit down and write a list of things that. You feel like you need to declutter that you've been holding on to or that kind of kind of keep coming back around us thoughts that you. Just are having a hard time. You know either processing through or just letting go of or not quite sure why this thought keeps coming into play, and why can't stop it and. You know how I you know or how I feel about myself. You know that might be a good place to start for for us."
13620.0,Patient,"yeah so. I should be like more specific i'll spend, like every single day my life living in like a traumatic. State like mentally. But. yeah definitely are times, where like not flashbacks but like there's a certain events have happened in my life. Then, like bring up about like a deep thought."
527.0,Provider,Sure sure.
13620.0,Patient,"But like i'll just be thinking about like right now as you're talking to me like. I zoned out for like five or six seconds, while you're saying. And it's nothing personal I just lost my train of thought, but. yeah so there's always be like tasks like to wear excellent we'll be talking to me and then i'll just be. Thinking about some random thing that is completely irrelevant to what we were talking about. And i'll share it. or blurted out but as far as the whole list thing like I can like put some stuff down I guess that I put some."
527.0,Provider,yeah do you think there's things you know from your relationship with your dad in the past that probably you're still hanging on to or. That could impact okay.
13620.0,Patient,"It could be I don't want to say, like indefinitely, that is it."
527.0,Provider,Right.
13620.0,Patient,Right you don't want to just blame other I mean there is like that personal responsibility for me to pay attention.
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah definitely and and part of it is not necessarily. pointing fingers but let's look at what are some significant events or situations or things that have impacted my life up to this point. hmm so maybe if putting it in that kind of perspective because I because yeah certainly you have your accountability and responsibility for your actions and behaviors as, as we all do, as individuals. But certainly you know there were probably things that have contributed or played into. your thoughts or feelings about yourself or others are situations, and so we can kind of maybe. unpack some of that and sort through it and figure out where that needs to go if that's something that you need to own or if that's something of somebody else's responsibility so definitely can kind of sort through all of that to."
13620.0,Patient,"yeah and. I just want to be careful, like what I say is I don't want I don't want to like come across to my doctor has like I have depression or something like that, because that's not the right, I want to take i'm not depressed."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13620.0,Patient,"i'm fine have a great life, but there are certain things certain things. In my past or does explain to you that have maybe affected how i've. handled certain circumstances, give me one second I got my headphones on. alright. Those are all things that can contribute to how I think or how distracted I get or. Share whatever setting those like I need to break those patterns those patterns."
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah definitely.
13620.0,Patient,i'm not like necessarily zoning out and like. You know. Post traumatic kind of thing you know.
527.0,Provider,"Sure yeah I mean it definitely sounds like you've got a lot of. A lot of things that you've been thinking about, and you know when there's maybe more kind of. I don't know when maybe say like more kind of concentrated conversations. That Maybe those are a little more difficult for you to really pay attention or focus on. Like if different kinds of emotions start maybe coming into play, like how do I manage these for myself and with the other people involved."
13620.0,Patient,yeah something Those are some things I can be working on. yeah but um I do yeah I do want to get better I do I don't want to keep. Making this like this repeating the same things over and over you know.
527.0,Provider,"Sure sure definitely so a couple things that we can do as far as scheduling our sessions what day, do you come to group."
13620.0,Patient,On lenses.
527.0,Provider,"on Wednesdays Okay, and then are there other days that are better for you like. it's like afternoons we're cope better mornings."
13620.0,Patient,or afternoons tend to work better for me.
527.0,Provider,"Okay alright so let's look at and then, as far as just our sessions, we can do them a couple different ways I can schedule, you know if you have difficulty like focusing and paying attention or concentrating we can schedule a shorter session for like a 30 minute session. If you feel like that's. You know enough, then we can do that, we can also schedule an hour and if you don't need the whole hour that's fine too. But I also want to kind of be mindful like what's going to be most helpful for you to like get in work hard for 30 minutes and move on, or if more than more time than that may you know, be a little more challenging or difficult, you know staying on track with yourself too so. You know, we can. And we can certainly play around with it, you know we get to go in and you know 30 minutes you're like I need a little bit more time, so we can always change the times of sessions to for you, so do."
13620.0,Patient,"You have 30 minutes is fine with me, I think I tend to verbally vomit some time so. I think I have everything I need to get out but."
527.0,Provider,"yeah like I said we'll we'll just kind of pay attention to it and if you need more time that will schedule more time too, so not a big deal okay. So let's look at. So I think you're scheduled for like twice a month, and then you have weekly group therapy as well, so."
13620.0,Patient,I.
527.0,Provider,"Think that's what we'll do so. Let me get back over to my calendar here. So your next group session is Thursday it looks like no i'm sorry Wednesday. The 29th this week so let's look at going into October, then. So the week of. October 11 so that will be two weeks from today, what about. i've got Tuesday the 12th. i've got a i've got a 1030 in the morning. or i've got an 11 1130.
