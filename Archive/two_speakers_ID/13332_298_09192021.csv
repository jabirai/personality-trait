You have. yeah Okay, the deal you don't have to change to come on board with us, we are a mental health program which means there's a bit to it more than just therapy. Just wanted you to be aware of that, in case you wanted to not do us, you can sign up with us, and if it's not your cup of tea, then you can bow out and say you know discharge me this isn't good for me, but I love, if you just give us a chance and see what we have to."
13332.0,Patient,offer see. i'm already here.
298.0,Provider,yeah right you've gotten this far you this was work to get here.
13332.0,Patient,"Yes, it was I had to do people cancel on me before this and so i'm like all right finally here let's just go."
298.0,Provider,"On yeah okay so i'm the person who does be. prescribing diagnosing in taking like your other site kinda like your other psychiatric nurse practitioner, the next appointments that you have your therapist will be involved, is it anytime that you want to make an appointment with me, you are welcome to do that here on zoom. So it's I won't do the prescriptions, because you have somebody else already doing the prescriptions and it's not mandated that I do. them if you have someone else. Another part is, you see a therapist on zoom and you do, that one on one and that's done about every other week and that's your time to go over anything that you want to go over. that's one part of our program the other part of our program is that you go to group therapy once a week for the first month that's one hour long. And i'll tell you what happens in group therapy and after one month, you can request to go down to twice a month if you've kept all your appointments. What happens in group therapy is it's not really a time to share a lot of personal things as much as it's a time of skill building, so the therapist is there, I am there you're there, of course. And there's other people there in the zoom room okay it's one hour long are you amenable to doing this or trying it."
13332.0,Patient,seems a little extensive but. I mean.
298.0,Provider,I can't take it out of there I wish I could take it out of our Program. But I can't be the only thing I could do for you is get to a referral to somebody who's therapy only at from your insurance and before that I can't guarantee you know that you get right into someone else. yeah that's a bummer.
13332.0,Patient,yeah I thought I was going to be able to see a therapist and talk and.
298.0,Provider,"yeah and you're actually joining a program and so that's that's something that many people don't understand, and so I want to be clear on that one."
13332.0,Patient,Okay yeah that's kind of different I didn't expect expect that I thought I was just getting a therapist.
298.0,Provider,yeah so would you like a referral to therapy only or would you like to continue on it's totally up to you.
13332.0,Patient,Probably like a referral to therapy.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, you are free to go and i'm so sorry."
13332.0,Patient,"it's okay I didn't know exactly what was entailed to. yeah because my. My what you might call it my. Health Insurance turned me on to you, and because I had been in a treatment Center and so she wanted me to get some help from a therapist and she referred me to you guys, but I don't think she really knows what's going on either."
298.0,Provider,"And we have people who come to us for therapy only they don't get prescriptions from me, but. They do the group therapy and sometimes that can be just like too much for people. yeah I get it, I get it."
13332.0,Patient,i'm sorry about that.
298.0,Provider,"No, no, no i'm the one who's sorry that the yeah yeah alright airplane."
