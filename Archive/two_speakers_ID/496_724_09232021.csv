724.0,Provider,can't complain. The other day you.
496.0,Patient,Oh great Thank you.
724.0,Provider,So this is our first.
496.0,Patient,he's going on but yeah.
724.0,Provider,that's our first session. What you got going on.
496.0,Patient,"The refrigerator is a mess my kitchen is a mess i'm just now trying to get it cleaned the fridge one hour will and four weeks i've been asking them to come and look at it, repair it, and then they want to charge me money said the warranty with that. yeah i'm just so i'm cleaning up the kitchen now."
724.0,Provider,"Oh, I heard to like um it's hard to get even replacement fridge rater right now for. some strange reason I guess like you can go to like so you're like home depot or lowes like. strange."
496.0,Patient,Okay i'm being job hunting so.
724.0,Provider,"What kind of work to do, perform."
496.0,Patient,"A number of things case management, I worked at a nonprofit right before the pending and kick so you know, I was laid off from that so i'm actually I got some phrases to work in that field so i've been applying. I talked to a couple people saw just send my resume off in a. Security. payroll building i've done a lot of things so."
724.0,Provider,What are you in treatment for exactly.
496.0,Patient,i'm for. A nice medication. Okay yeah for narcos.
724.0,Provider,What medications you currently get prescribe.
496.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,what's your dose on suboxone.
496.0,Patient,"i'm 60 milligrams of actually. going down tapering because I it's been almost four years. And i'm actually doing pretty good you know, like, I can go literally like almost all day now without you know, taking them I one time I forgot that I was supposed to take on so."
724.0,Provider,You can go a whole day without taking. yeah you're okay.
496.0,Patient,"Yes, like I said it's gonna you know I guess when she gave us a system, I just don't know like is there a they say, well, when I had Dr did you know that the waters. No okay so that's why I started with when I started the program and like you know they say people staying on for years and that's not something that I want to do you know it's not something that I."
724.0,Provider,"I guess a better way to reframe it was like people can stay on for years now everybody's unique they might have like a different situation. Traditionally, like when I worked in you know substance abuse field. Most people that got on suboxone eventually got off suboxone unless they were on it, for they had some other kind of like lifetime chronic illness that. You know suboxone was the only alternative that they were eligible for. And it was somewhat rare, I know that they use buprenorphine. For some product pain management so people that have like like crazy levels or."
496.0,Patient,suboxone the driver knew what it was I had some clients at the crossroads at the shelter and she was taking them for chronic pain.
724.0,Provider,"yeah but, like in my state like it was wearing unless it's changed with like they weren't allowed to prescribe suboxone for pain management. Oh, but I know in California, that they can prescribe you from morphine which is. You know, essentially. yeah it's without the locks on attached to it so. Why so it's like like all these crazy like probably like insurance workarounds but beautiful northeast is effective pain supplement it really is because."
496.0,Patient,"i've never. looked at it like. pain, so he helps with pain yep. It can help oh."
724.0,Provider,"you're from northeast buprenorphine does like that another drive straight buprenorphine if that if that's what they would call sub you text. because somebody text is like the generic term without the locks on attached to it. Right, so that there are elements like that, but, most people that I dealt with my experience like once they they got on suboxone they eventually within. Several months or to up to a year typically like like like our target date was like nine months because a lock it happened in nine months right. Most of the people that I dealt with their on methadone and. A significant number right and eventually over time. They decrease that number into 40 milligrams and then we would tell them to not take anything for like two days which would suck for them. But there was a reason, because if they came back the very next day, and then we gave him suboxone it would put them in precipitated withdraw it like immediately and we didn't want to do. Now that's even worse so it's like withdraw."
496.0,Patient,And that's an old person not to take anything for today.
724.0,Provider,"yeah just about two days, because um but traditionally like methadone like stay in your system. 24 to 36 hours was like the half life on that, like so you could take it, and you can miss a day and it's not the end of the world, it doesn't really start feeling like the end of the world to the individual until like day three day four. But. You gotta think of the mindset of somebody who's like in like in that headspace of you know, active addiction, sometimes and they're like well I can't I can't experience any kind of my new discomfort because if that's the case it's like all right. Well, I got it, you know I got it i'm like you can it's not going to kill you, but if that's how you feel then Okay, who."
496.0,Patient,"are seeking treatment they wanted to before before I found the the hospital because I guess Now you can go into emergency ones and let them know you know that you haven't problem addiction and you want to recover so that's where suboxone was. introduced to me was an emergency room and but before that, like you know you Google some things and there's a actual click not too far from my house and. I went in there, trying to get you methanol like oh absolutely not you know, like i'm trying to get off like the norco and you want to give me methadone."
724.0,Provider,"there's a place for it so like initially like the history of methadone was the it was like returning vets from Vietnam, who developed opiate dependencies over."
496.0,Patient,Try.
724.0,Provider,"The idea was and we had crazy start times like I worked, the methadone clinics for like three or four years because that's where like I really cut my teeth and that's where most people coming out of college really get like there's no other jobs for counselors when you. Know experiences they throw in a methadone clinic and you learn a lot you learn you learn a whole hell of a lot. So, then, the star times used to be like 5am 5am in the morning, so i'd get there, like 430 in the morning right. And everybody's they're already there already be like the patient's already beat me there i'm like Christ so. But the idea was to get them, starting in but, again, a minute five in the morning, that way they get to work at eight or nine to five job, the reality is that none none of these people worked. You know now part so on, so that that was a flawed system, and then they allowed them to get in I was, I was in Florida when this happened. They allow the individual to dictate their milligram dosage so every day they come into the nursery like how are you feeling today in the book, I feel like crap babu. 555 and then over a period of time, you know what I mean like they're already up to like 120 I had people that were like at 300 milligrams and you're like well you're never worked out that number, you know if we're going to. One or two milligrams a week taper on you it's like you're looking at like three years right away. And then some companies got greedy there's obviously profit in there, you know I."
496.0,Patient,ran.
724.0,Provider,"One agency that I worked for was a cash only operation and we had 1400 patients, it was."
496.0,Patient,"At the time, it was like 17 bucks a day cash only to dose."
724.0,Provider,"And I was a manager at one point, so I got the count the money and, at the end of the day, on Friday, or like on a three day weekend a holiday weekend and I come into count the money, I had money colors was like a lot. Like build. out sort of like so much into stacks stacks of my I was like this looks like a rap video. It was crazy like the most money that ever seen like single days like."
496.0,Patient,"$90,000 $100."
724.0,Provider,"Just crazy amounts of money, and I was like hmm. So yeah I mean there's always been some creepiness attached to it."
496.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"And then i've worked for clinics, where it's like we're going to get you up to a therapeutic value and scientifically like 8080 milligrams you know they said was like anything over 80 was. wasn't therapeutic from 80 to 300 you gave the same therapeutic value so we would push people to at if need be, and then work them down and then put them on suboxone and then get them out like that was the."
496.0,Patient,way.
724.0,Provider,"No so like a one year plan or a year and a half plan, whatever it was and then people very like in different states of addiction like they're either actively using with with data. yeah."
496.0,Patient,"Those that have been doing it forever and and you can tell the ones who are not trying to change they don't want to change. You know, we had. yeah at the shelter we I was a few, and it was so sad I was like wow and see me I had an accident and actually I was on a lot it. So from that had surgery my leg almost lost my life actually. So, then, I gotta yeah I had a fall fall, I feel. His great my knee and a call back and infection. Well, from that we have from the fall, and so I got cellulitis in my leg. Okay, so I was in a room that I was in the hospital for two. Months yeah they didn't know if I was gonna make it through the night, it was it was."
724.0,Provider,Good chapters and.
496.0,Patient,"Quality yeah well yeah. yeah it was bad it was bad like my leg was like three times the size that it was supposed to be, and they have my family come all in and say goodbye, it was. yeah it was the pain and the pain was so severe so you know they kept me medicated they weren't they were given it through the ice and they were also given it to me in the tablet. that's how bad the pain was for me until it until the medication caught up with the pain, you know, and so I was numb to it. And then, of course, you develop a tolerance, you know. So when I got out, you know, and then, when they cut you off when the hospital takes away your you know, then there are no people who have for sale pills, you know, so I started getting into them and."
724.0,Provider,"yeah there was never really like any good oversight. So we're like the opiate epidemic really kicked off in this in this country was like in the mid 2000s right and it really started with oxy cotton in Florida, and like they said, like 80% of all the prescriptions that were written. For oxy cotton came out of one county in Florida so you're out in California right. yeah alright so so like imagine like la county or orange county road 80% of all United States prescriptions. Because. So you imagine, like the volume of people that were there and then you know trafficking happen, and then it just disperse from it, because there was no oversight, on pain management clinics and I kind of Florida was the Wild West and I was down there for like the Wild West times. And i'm. So then, what happens it's just like any other pendulum right where it goes from one extreme to where there's no oversight to all of a sudden there's too much oversight and now like, even by today's standard like. Positions anybody that's eligible that's you know license or write a prescription for anything their hands are essentially tied when it comes to narcotics like I worked in the er."
496.0,Patient,You know right before wow.
724.0,Provider,"And I had people come in and they probably qualified for some some heavy hitting narcotics, because they were they were in bad shape and they just cannot get them like the doctors had to jump through. A lot of hoops they had a low dose like it was just really, really hard you know people were like oh you're just going to send me home with Todd on there, like that's the best. You know what I mean so like a lot of that do. Exactly you know what I mean, so you know that's just how you know it's how the government reacts you know from one extreme to the other there's no logic there's no happy medium it's always you know band aids for gunshot wounds sometimes and. Right, where the middle there's got to be like like a like an equal ground but because it was such a problem at that was left unchecked, for as long as it was, we really do have an opiate epidemic."
496.0,Patient,"problem we. Now, everybody. let's see if you can get them on the street. yeah well, then you got the people who they get prescribed if they don't take them so they sell them, you know, or they get in that, essentially, how you know I fell into that. Little crack and then it was like I you know I just got to the point where I just didn't want to. live like that it was bad it was bad like a year, a year and a half, like I just fine just make down, you know it seemed like everything just moves and I thank God I didn't lose my home, you know. they'll hear here today still you know even put my son out because I didn't want to see him, you know see me living like that, and looking like that I didn't care I didn't care about anything."
724.0,Provider,"Yes, only a pitfall. It is yeah and the other extreme, is now that like now that people can't get them. they're not as accessible the pills weren't people started you they resorted to the tried and true method, which was heroin in a lot of the patients that I met, and I was like. You know in hindsight, would you ever shot heroin and they're like hell, no, you know when I was younger and stuff like taken to pills was. Real clean it's easy you know there's it's not grimy at all it's like now it's like. Like i'm sticking needles in between my toes because all my bands or collapse because I can't get pills anymore and it's like. You know that that's the other pitfall and now because none of that stuff is really accessible anymore, they they cracked out so hard now like fat all is everywhere that people are."
496.0,Patient,yeah. yeah and that's worse than Ray.
724.0,Provider,"At this point it is yeah it's just we're just waiting for that, like that next thing you know. So."
496.0,Patient,"Now this device on work with fit knowledge well, so you can like get off."
724.0,Provider,"Well, no, you wouldn't you wouldn't want to be you wouldn't want to be using any illicit opiates on suboxone because it's got the locks on it so it's going to push all that stuff off the receptors and put you in precipitated winter, also the not lock sewn into boxing is like the. The turn. In that pill right, so it makes you not want to do, because if you do you're going to pay for it. Right so it's actually really good you know I prefer there to be an abundance of suboxone on the streets now, at this point because it's the lesser of two evils and it's safer."
496.0,Patient,route people and they really wouldn't know well you know they take them they realize that it's helping them get good clean.
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah I went to a and I talked about this, the other night I went to a seminar. A couple years back, and really changed my perspective on it, because I felt like in my state at the time, there was no oversight for people getting prescribe suboxone like we didn't have treatment plans. We didn't really have like the accountability and and I was like i'm somewhat of like a hard ass like military time. And I was like so we're just going to prescribe people that are not employed don't have stable housing don't have stable environmental factors no support him we're just going to give them a controlled substance have them check in with us once a week once every two weeks. we're going to supplement their income we're going to supplement their their drug habit, I was like so like to me and I was like that's that's all bullshit you know to me it's like. I shouldn't be doing that I was like we're not helping anybody. But, but then the lady was like would you rather there be more suboxone on the street or fentanyl and I was like. All right, alright."
496.0,Patient,Thank you. I was I.
724.0,Provider,"was like that that does alter my perspective, a little bit, and the more richer that I get with it, the more people, I know that have been directly affected by it i'm like. yeah she's probably right and her Defense to she was like I was a hard ass to the beginning, I was like Okay, you know what."
496.0,Patient,"She yeah so she thought about and that's. Why do they like, I said when I was want to go there and I went there like you said it is early I got there four in the morning. You know it's nobody else's there than here come and then all of a sudden, I look behind me and there's a line of people standing there and i'm like Okay, you know and it's like, why do you want to push the methadone. You know right, I was like oh no. you're. gonna take me off, for one thing, and give me another."
724.0,Provider,"It essentially it is it again, is the lesser of two evils for sure, but the methadone trap. It takes a lot longer to stabilize on that medication that it does on suboxone but if you're if you don't have all the the proper environmental factors in place that I definitely would not be like yeah just give somebody suboxone because we don't know anything about you, yet we. don't gives you time some accountability. But there's got to be like an even playing field, you know what I mean like the problem of methadone is it that most people don't stabilize until like 6570, but you can only start at like 35 you can only go up by like five every week or so."
496.0,Patient,"So, by the time you get stable."
724.0,Provider,"Your two months into it then it's like all right now we're going to work you back down. Like. It is problematic, you know what I mean like in a perfect world. You would have people coming in daily to dose would suboxone daily that would probably be the most effective way, but the way that the prescriptions are written in the DEA is regulations are you can't store in a vault like you can't methanol methadone comes in, like it looks like."
496.0,Patient,The.
724.0,Provider,"Oil now it comes in, like like motor oil okay at canisters."
496.0,Patient,"Oh, and then, then, then a nurse is poured into a machine."
724.0,Provider,skirts and then. walk in the safe. The safe has to be behind like another locked entry the DEA has a whole bunch of like method or regulations in order to like save storage and supply. You know what I mean like it's it's crazy like like it's crazy where suboxone we weren't allowed that he would not allow methadone clinics to store large amounts.
496.0,Patient,"Of suboxone right, but I think they can do it now right."
724.0,Provider,"If it's changed. and spent several years since i've been out that would be the move to have people coming in and dosing daily with somebody. And then, and then rapport building with their counselor make sure that all the other things are in place and they'd be like I come back in three days come back and five days come back in. 10 days, instead of just being like here's a script for a week here's a script for two weeks and i'll."
496.0,Patient,See you later.
724.0,Provider,know what I mean so there's gotta be it's gotta be conversations. That can be had to. meet those standards to keep everybody happy collectively.
496.0,Patient,"All right, right."
724.0,Provider,So.
496.0,Patient,"I just I just mentioned, pay the people you know wanted it better. You know cuz you can't you can't get right hey get your mind why you think it's like it's nothing like that withdraw it, such as well, for me, that was like I couldn't talk I couldn't you know didn't want to do anything. And then I kept trying cold Turkey. On my own I kept trying, you know I did I tried a few times that I just couldn't do it, I try like that morning and try to go all my body, it killed me."
724.0,Provider,"Well it's good that you're at that point now that, where you can start tapering yourself what I would encourage you to do is. i'm finding some kind of like flew. Over a couple days. it's is keep a record of when you are dosing and stick to it so like if you dose it what like say eight milligrams. For your first dose. And then, whatever your second time would be for your second dose. push it off by like 15 minutes, and if you can go 15 minutes, and maybe you can go 15 more minutes, so if you go 15 more minutes and keep doing that and eventually like your second dosing time would get closer to overtime your initial dosing time. To where you're like all right, I just cut eight milligrams out of my out of my regimen and then eventually used to start doing that was like now, I want to take the eight and spread that, of course. You know, two times a day so it's like I take four in the morning and then push it push it push it and then eventually as long as you're keeping it like a log. yeah instead of just being like like consistency is key, with that medication, because it allows your body to start developing a routine it's just like eating. Like everything else you might like when people go on diets they're like I just want to eat anything and it's like that's wrong because reality is is that now your body doesn't know when it's going to get food in so whatever you do it's going to hold on to for a super long time. Because it's. regimented So if you eat a cheeseburger it's going to pull every possible nutrient on it, because it just doesn't know what it's going to eat again and then. it's like okay now I can get rid of it. So you actually end up eating more."
496.0,Patient,"Oh, I know that i've struggled with that to. Love that's another struggle of. Mine i'm working on right now so. yeah, especially in the last I think three years I probably put on about 65 and maybe a little more than that, and so that's a struggle of my lessons over the years have been a struggle and I lose weight gain weight lose weight gain weight, you know."
724.0,Provider,It has.
496.0,Patient,helped me not to be able to fit anything it helped me. to cook better i'm.
724.0,Provider,Good.
496.0,Patient,With everything i'm like the world's best chef now start. cooking channel.
724.0,Provider,"um The other thing we got to talk about is I saw a inquiry about a complaint that you had with Dr O Gala. Yes, what to tell them what's going on with this."
496.0,Patient,"Yes, I do."
724.0,Provider,"Because they want my perspective, but. I haven't met you so I want your perspective."
496.0,Patient,"Okay, so. she's new I just I just got her you know we've only probably had maybe three session because I only come to group once a month okay so like I said it's almost four years now that i've been with her help and. So December will may four years so i've been I come to group i've never missed group since i've started, because you know, in the beginning, you have to come, I think I had to go quite."
724.0,Provider,"quickly, do you go with."
496.0,Patient,"Exactly, so I did everything that I needed to I comply with everything, especially because I need my medication yeah you have to do it if you want. Your medication, in order for you to get well so as time goes I graduated I graduated to you know twice a month, then I graduated to once a month to have to come to do, how I do it, and like I said there's never been, even when I had when I had Dr waters, and then I had. Dr. That he just he let oh God I can't even think of his name right now. we're just a doctor that I had before document and so we've never had like a set date when I come. I come every Monday okay if there's for monday's in a month i'll come on that third Monday if there's five Mondays in a month i'll come on their fourth month. You get what i'm saying. So that's how i've been doing it, I normally come to grow and because, by that time that's when it's time for me to need a refill by the time you know that Monday comes it's refill time now so since I had her i've been coming she told me, the last time she saw me was July, the 19th."
724.0,Provider,"that's the last time that I saw you that was my very first night of work, and that was the last time."
496.0,Patient,"Right so July 19 that was for monday's in that month okay that was that third Monday. August had five Mondays so I was coming on the fourth Monday, which was the 23rd. And then you got. You exactly so they rescheduled group okay so after that, then they called me and said. Regarding wants to know if you want to change your group tonight and. So, then I say Oh well, I guess, you know that I said, well, I mean if that works out better I said i'll be nine I don't my nine now nine o'clock am i'm changing my time changes my my Daddy did I lose you understand what I mean."
724.0,Provider,Was it out of my day record oh.
496.0,Patient,"It was wasn't them because group used to be Thursdays and then he went to Monday So yes, it was on a Monday Okay, so they call it, they call me they emailed me and said. Group is being cancelled because of the holiday, and then they call me and say doctor wants to know if you want to do 9am till the next time I came the group. Was this past I just went to group um what, not to say I went yesterday, but after that, when I came in and then that's when they emailed me and said. Allah wants to talk to you, she shutting you off just me I said, excuse me, I say, what do you mean she said that you have I said I have said, because it wasn't time for me to come and when I came you guys reschedule group. So how am I, being analyzed for something that my routine that i've always done now, like I said I said, if she wants me to do. Every third Monday i'll do that that's fine. If it'll make everything better you know, then that's fine with me, but to tell me and then she tells me last night. She wants me to come, three times a week twice and I said, excuse me, I said so all the progress that i've made all these years you got to push me back coming back and starting over absolutely not that's that's not gonna work for me. To me, so you know you know you tell me what she's saying."
724.0,Provider,"No, no, I read the inquiry, so I was just I wanted to get your perspective on. Now, the only the only logistical roadblock that could see about the you know the fourth Monday or the fifth Monday would be like what we ran into with the holiday. um because the providers have to write prescriptions in advance, so if you're if you're essentially a once a month refill. I can't imagine me personally, being able to keep track of everybody that I write prescriptions unless there's a different kind of system but. I would think that it would probably be easier to be to show up on the first Monday of every month because that's like that's almost 30 to 30 does that make sense. that's it that's manage."
496.0,Patient,"Yes, okay so let's say I was. Well, I mean, I guess, then just be sitting there I guess waiting for me to pick it up if that's if that's how we want to put it, because the 30 to 30 would be at the end of the month, for me, you know I mean not the first Monday."
724.0,Provider,"But from from from like a like a prescriber standpoint like like from my viewpoint, anyway, it would just be like this is the first Monday of the bunk I want to write you a script until look at the date. be like that's the date of the the last Sunday of that of that or the first Sunday of the upcoming month does that make sense, I would like. it'd be easier for me to look at a calendar be like i've been ratio script from today's the 22nd to the 23rd of next month because it's an extra day boom we're good to go and opposed to like I did you show up on the third month because when we get our attendance list."
496.0,Patient,We.
724.0,Provider,"It just says if you're a monthly or if you come twice twice a month, it doesn't say what days you call that would be too. Late so like i'll look at the attendance and it's just like I honestly whoever shows up is the attendance is what I said I don't know when people are supposed to show up like like I just don't have that system in place."
496.0,Patient,Right.
724.0,Provider,"So I would imagine that the prescribers in a similar situation. For me, would be easier to prescribe the first Monday of the month, until the first Monday of the next coming boss and opposed to being third third or whatever it is, if I."
496.0,Patient,"Ever whichever way makes it makes for Dr water and Dr. Right now, they have an issue, so I don't know, maybe."
724.0,Provider,Because they started with you.
496.0,Patient,"All right, well yeah yeah."
724.0,Provider,"So that's probably what it was they probably had their own system in. place. I know inherently like me myself personally, when I inherited caseload it's always a disaster in the beginning, because whatever system they use previous is probably not the system that i'm going to use or in. their own way of doing things so it could be a little bit of that too. So it's definitely an adjustment. The other thing I noticed you're supposed to do, surveys right. yeah yeah I."
496.0,Patient,Do my survey.
724.0,Provider,You do your service.
496.0,Patient,"I do, once a month and I don't."
724.0,Provider,yeah cuz cuz.
496.0,Patient,OK OK.
724.0,Provider,"OK, because in here because there's something called like the band seven and which is the. The survey for addiction right. And the seventh in the survey been seven days, so the surveys asked you within the last seven days that's that's probably do weekly."
496.0,Patient,"Okay, because."
724.0,Provider,"According to. The software here, it says, like the last time you did a pH Q nine. Which is the depressed mood survey was submitted 322 21 the last. mile dad seven survey, which is the general anxiety survey was 322 21 here behind it all your surveys oh."
496.0,Patient,"OK, I can I can probably admit that. yeah because you know my thumb. And you use be checking in so then they'll email me the survey and i'll do it, you know, and then I didn't realize."
724.0,Provider,"Every yeah those are those are do the band seven is do every week and then the pH Q nine the gad seven alternate so those ones are do twice a month, but I just tell everybody like if it's sitting in your survey Q just do it. doesn't matter where."
496.0,Patient,If there's a survey monkey.
724.0,Provider,"Well, you should have like a like an email link so like when they email you the survey like that's the same link that's what i've been told, from all the patients that's the same email link that you use every week to do your survey."
496.0,Patient,"Okay, so. They just normally just send me okay yeah. I do. The surveys every month when I come to cool so. yeah my surveys are."
724.0,Provider,You have way way out of compliance that that alone is enough on paper to to hassle you for.
496.0,Patient,That yeah I can. yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Because the DEA the feds and all the other regulatory systems that are in place, they they use these surveys as measurement tools for progress. And because they can be like okay like you meet with miss Logan once a month how she doing it's like well I didn't see your last month they're like okay so it's 60 days. How she doing it's like I don't know. The surveys are one way to cover your ass right because it's all self reported progress or lack thereof. It really benefits you as well as say you got. Some other kind of ancillary services intervening with you, whatever whatever you know people have all kinds of services that are like that they have to be compliant with those things cover you in that sense to just as much as it covers us so there, they are important. So the Service have to be done, you had a no show with me like September. that's about to get you to like dig so you've got some things right now that's definitely going against you, for sure. As far as row gallegos we could switch us that way you don't have to deal with her to a different group that's not a problem. But the expectation is for the next 30 days, we need to get some. More interactions between you and I, and your groups and then review after those two weeks to see how you're doing because really it's a compliance issue and on paper you're really not in compliance. Even though you're you have earned the right to have limited engagements there are some things that have been slack or communication breakdown, whatever it is."
496.0,Patient,"yeah because nobody told me that. Do those surveys every week I all I know, is when I check in they tell me, you have to do the survey email it to me and i'll do the survey and they'll tell me that i'm good so, then why hasn't anybody told me that my surveys were not up to complain. About I would have taken the time and does yeah."
724.0,Provider,"I looked at it now, before like before I normally look at everybody's. Little things like that, before I start the session, just so I could remind them to do, Sir, because I know like life happens and people with those servers are like I don't know when they're do. You know, because there's so many of them, so I just tell people like you know, on Sunday night for the upcoming week. You go to that to that email link if there's a survey in there, especially the band seven because it's do every week. Do it if you have a pH Q died serving do it, you know it takes like I did the band seven survey it's like 33 questions, it took me about 10 minutes, the first time i'm sure, by the time it would probably take me like two minutes to do it."
496.0,Patient,"On my phone was no problem and I. don't get it done and see and that's upsetting to me, nobody says when you talk to people, then why isn't anybody communicating that saying hey you need to do this, or this needs to be done even Ashley or anybody."
724.0,Provider,"yeah i'm not sure, maybe i'm telling you wrong but put those care measures it's like the last time you did it things we're overdue and I looked at it and I was like yeah it's been. it's been six months, you know, since the think updated so I just been telling everybody so just moving forward do your surveys, like every week as a pop I guess they populate in there just to get them done."
496.0,Patient,survey should be. compliant so. We see as far as like once a month goals like not weekly i'm not gonna say that because no I don't do a weekly nobody told me that now monthly yeah I should be.
724.0,Provider,Which one. Do but.
496.0,Patient,i'm the will you call.
724.0,Provider,Your hair for so.
496.0,Patient,They hear the.
724.0,Provider,question I.
496.0,Patient,"don't know what the number is, but the question, the one that you saved me. The one you say the seven need seven days."
724.0,Provider,yep a band seven.
496.0,Patient,Advanced yeah.
724.0,Provider,that's do weekly.
496.0,Patient,"Right and no buddy. Man I don't know, maybe early in the beginning. And maybe all this time I probably just I mean Look how long it's been nobody's ever said that to me, you know it's almost like how am I fought for that nobody's called me nobody's email me and say hello teacher now when I do get out do it, like you, all this time."
724.0,Provider,"we're starting fresh, do you know counselor newbie so that way we start on a even a. That even yeah but you want to say that you want me to come in."
496.0,Patient,once a week now.
724.0,Provider,yeah but only for the next 30 days you think you could manage that.
496.0,Patient,"Well, I mean I guess. I guess I don't think it's fair but."
724.0,Provider,"Well, like I said, like somebody other says obviously been like some communication breakdown so. it's not. Not so much of a penalty but I will just call like like a like a reengagement and then we'll go, you know we'll reevaluate I don't I don't foresee you being a problem, I know that on like the 19th. My initial group, you had good shit to say you don't I mean like I don't see you as being disruptive or obstinate define if there are communication breakdowns. will make that known and then we'll will correct them because that's fixable you know what I mean like. I don't find you to be defiant for the phone sees."
496.0,Patient,me give my input and.
724.0,Provider,Then you might have something some kind of insight for somebody that might save someone's life too so.
496.0,Patient,"i'm always have you know, even when you know because. It like I said when I was before Ashley you know and that's why I say it's like this thing people change, and I know people move on and do different things. You know, with different jobs or what have you, you know and like I said the people that start with may not be the people you in with. And then and that's not fair to you know so now I gotta start over because. You guys don't know me well. Prove myself."
724.0,Provider,"it's a hassle I know. It is it's the worst part of being a counselor is when definitely when you get to leave you know what I mean like is it's disruptive for the for the client it's always hard to leave. But she worked in this field too, and you know that, like upward progression sometimes happens without wanting to and i'll give you like a story like my clinical supervisor like my mentor. told him that because I started residential. And did for a year, like drug court, I did it for a year. And then I was like. And we lost our contract, for whatever reason I forget. And I had to leave so he was like where you're going to go and I was like well I play with this methadone clinic in his eyes got big. He was like Have you ever worked with methadone I was like no he was like oh man he's like you're going to learn a lot he's like I started the BAT though it was like as a counselor I was like that's cool. is like, and then I became a supervisor the clinic supervisor in about six months I was like why that's crazy progression he's like oh no my. Political supervisor got locked in her office and. shot killed by a patient anyway, so, then he was I was like oh it's that type of environment he's like oh yeah it can be that type of environment, I was like. All right, so sometimes you know what I mean like it's not really up to you, when you move on to bigger and better things you're kind of."
496.0,Patient,"Right right. Right yeah like the line I don't know, did you know the language. Though oh."
724.0,Provider,yeah I don't know.
496.0,Patient,I started with her and that that's you know which group and then ELENA left and we got Ashley and had her for a little I don't even think I had her for a year.
724.0,Provider,"So yeah actually still around she she only left that group because. she's going to Grad school and. Right so again like trying to like better your your career prospects it comes at a cost. Alright, so yeah so right now, your band seven the page Q night and the patient satisfactory survey or do. They all say overdue so that'll that's probably sitting somewhere in your in your. email queue so."
496.0,Patient,"I don't know I don't get I don't get. I don't get this like I don't get like an alert or like an email, just like a random."
724.0,Provider,"Yes, you like like. I gotta save it so go, can you go to like your most recent one."
496.0,Patient,yeah i'm.
724.0,Provider,"Just log in and see if you can access the surveys from there. Because that's where all the other patients selling that they do, they just they bookmark that that email, and then they that's just where they go to submit them."
496.0,Patient,"Okay, here are the last. One I mean this stuff is. OK so. So here's nays say you say you haven't gotten one since March."
724.0,Provider,or say it was what did I say. And you know.
496.0,Patient,"i'm a gentleman i've done all of those so i'm looking at, I mean i'm not weekly but yeah. So I have the I have the weekly van seven the PhD line, and then the patient satisfaction survey so."
724.0,Provider,"yeah So those are the ones that are do. yeah 322 21 date submitted. The most current one. You don't get prescribed any other medications you don't take any bands or anything like that. yeah. So so here's the plan so your ultimate goal is to get off the medication correct. Right so. Why don't we decide to you want to you want to do, like a target date pre bond six months, nine months, what do you want."
496.0,Patient,"um. I guess let's say, well, I guess i'll see if I say mine lesson didn't decide to change it, I can. yeah. let's say nine minutes. You know not easy, especially getting off the House was just sitting here and. i'm Sorry, I think, looking at the email but yeah especially getting out the House just just sitting here, you know my fingers just to get out and it really helped me get my mind right and."
724.0,Provider,Why don't you just job search and so you're already.
496.0,Patient,Right.
724.0,Provider,"direction so that's good. Okay, so we'll do a target date of you know projection diamonds could be sooner could be later, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there. As far as the compliance thing you're gonna start doing your surveys weekly."
496.0,Patient,Because it doesn't even say you there needs to be done weekly.
724.0,Provider,"Right yeah I don't think it does, I think there's."
496.0,Patient,About seven days.
724.0,Provider,"yeah I think they put the onus on on the patient, so there might have been a communication breakdown, but now na you know this. The CIA agents do a weekly that way you don't have to worry about I don't know if people get penalized for doing too many surveys, but they definitely get penalized for not doing surveys so. I don't think you can never have enough of self reporting so. pick a day and like before the upcoming week you know if your groups or whatever day your group is if it was me if I groups are on Wednesday, I wouldn't wait till Wednesday to do I would do on Sunday night and then we're. not worried about until the following Sunday now have all my homework done for the week. So that's important to you that what we'll do is the next 30 days. You and i'll be twice and i'd like you to go to group once a week, whether or not you're going to go continue to go into that Monday night group is up in the air, so i'll contact. Catherine she's my Supervisor to let her know that you're willing to do that, but we want to swap your group, and then the Karen as will coordinate with you to pick a day. off and you can't miss any of those sessions so six sessions you'd be responsible for the next 30 days or so whenever it starts you can't miss those right. And if you have to miss them absolutely have to discipline, you know in advance call on cancelled like don't know show no showing looks awful right. So don't do that. And then we'll reevaluate and then probably puts you back out to the 30 day the one in one."
496.0,Patient,Oh.
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah awesome yeah I look look, I will advocate for you. All to me that those decisions lie within higher powers, but if you do those things, for me, I will most certainly advocate, on your behalf, to do that, like."
496.0,Patient,He really cares so fucked up is that it is that's not that's not right. That is all jacked up that really is.
724.0,Provider,"Yet, but I will advocate."
496.0,Patient,to trust the process trust the program and you do everything right you get somebody who sits up and.
724.0,Provider,"it's a it's a hassle I won't argue that with you, I know that but."
496.0,Patient,With a bunch of crap it is OK. OK.
724.0,Provider,But we'll do that for the next 30. I mean. You don't like talking to me.
496.0,Patient,"No i'm just. kidding nothing it's her I got the issue and honestly. Right, but I don't know."
724.0,Provider,yeah well we'll resolve that.
496.0,Patient,issue. You know we all had understanding and whatever if I get it okay.
724.0,Provider,But yeah we'll do that so. what's what's today.
496.0,Patient,Wednesday any second.
724.0,Provider,What time. works for you.
496.0,Patient,um I like the evening time thanks oh seven o'clock.
724.0,Provider,"six or seven o'clock. We can do seven o'clock on October six, which is a Wednesday."
496.0,Patient,For for for being you. yeah that's fine. yeah evening.
724.0,Provider,yeah i'm on the east coast so it's like.
496.0,Patient,Oh.
724.0,Provider,Eight o'clock my time or.
496.0,Patient,"Oh, oh."
724.0,Provider,So 667 o'clock your time.
496.0,Patient,"Also, seven on the six."
724.0,Provider,"yep yep October, six, seven o'clock. Okay, all right, and then i'll have all care nouns contact you would like any kind of change of the group. Day and time so really."
496.0,Patient,On Monday. The six o'clock on Monday.
724.0,Provider,yep i'll let them know all that kind of good stuff. Any other any other questions or concerns.
496.0,Patient,"No, I guess."
724.0,Provider,I know you're frustrated um. But I wanted to hear your side of the story that.
496.0,Patient,"I cannot tell somebody you know. Okay, so this one here needs to be done every seven days So what about the other to."
724.0,Provider,"The other two, they say they alternate so they're supposed to be done by weekly meaning like twice a month, but then that means that you have to remember, which one you did when. And unless you're super organized I would screw it up all the time, so I just tell people to do every every every week that you're gonna do the band seven to do the gad seven and the pH Q nine with it. And just be done with it the survey the patient satisfaction survey is due every 90 days, so you don't have to worry about that one like that one should only show up once in a while. that's not the big one that they're worried about so much is the the band of seven and the pH Q those those three."
496.0,Patient,"Those. So I can do those together, I can do more together at the same time, I have to do it."
724.0,Provider,"They haven't told me one way or the other, so I would just do them all together, I haven't been told not to start telling people to do that, so it seems to be working at this point. And, like, I said that their their self reporting surveys, you know say you're saying individuals depressed and it's not their week to do their pH Q nine. Would it makes sense that makes that person wait two weeks to fill out a survey if they weren't feeling good, so I don't I don't think they're that critical about it, I wouldn't be personally. it's hard enough getting people just to do the surveys little long people that are doing too many surveys i'd rather have that than not enough so that's my thought process on it."
496.0,Patient,"Okay, and then you said you wanted to me apply so yeah."
724.0,Provider,"So we'll do October six and then, when we beat on October six we'll we'll pick another day after that one and that'll be our that'll be our two for the month. And then, just the four groups all right."
496.0,Patient,Okay.
724.0,Provider,"So stay on top of it on your end and then i'll do all the advocating on my it'll make my life easier when it comes to advocating that's my job, essentially, is the. could be the person that fights for you, when it comes to."
496.0,Patient,"I mean right, because if you go back in my chart and just look at you know. Look at everything that i've done look at how i've been operating, you know how things have been going like I say when you change people change, you know they may want to then communicate that then. yeah convey that in a conversation with me and family try a new one, this is how I run things in my groups, and this is how I do that don't have an expectation or somebody. And then, when it doesn't go the way you've been thinking in your mind, then you just go ahead and you do me it put a red check on my name."
724.0,Provider,"yeah no you're right yeah communication is the key, and like ironically that's like why we're in counseling. it's all communication so. But yeah so that's the deal will I will follow up here in a couple weeks. And like I said i'll have Karen has contact you with any kind of like a change in the schedule all right. Okay yep do those surveys do your do your urine talk screens if it comes in, like this to all."
496.0,Patient,Have any issues.
724.0,Provider,"All right, i'll See you in a couple weeks okay all right be good. Better. For transcription That was the individual therapy session for. levitra Logan. tentatively set a new treatment goal to be done with her suboxone nine months from today. with us. July tentatively. talked about compliance, we talked about her inquiry with the doctor. we're going to want to increase group visitation and two times a month individual session for the next 30 days and then we'll revisit her for compliance we address the survey compliance and that's it she's scheduled for follow me October sixth. At 7pm her time, thank you."
