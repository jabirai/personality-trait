759.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
16996.0,Patient,"um despite I mean there's some little things that happened last week but it's Okay, I mean but um yeah um was I gonna say Oh, and I do start school tomorrow. Okay um I mean i'm not necessarily nervous more just so. I don't know i'm just like I don't want to think of the worst because I just want to make I want to make sure I do well, I mean. Right and also like because I was just kind of thinking about it because I have, I am working a lot like i'm going to be super busy, I have two jobs i'm."
759.0,Provider,gonna be hard to aggravate.
16996.0,Patient,"yeah yeah um yeah is even now, without being in school. But yeah I am, though I am taking like i'm not i'm taking like a half semester so like three classes and. Two of them are like. Accurate Arc humanity classes so i'm hopefully i'll be able to balance them um but. yeah I um yeah i've been feeling pretty good for the most part. I will say there are some moments where i've been feeling like I don't know I think this might be like. I guess not I know it's not just like an insecurity more of like I guess certain thought patterns and like. That that just kind of come up that have like kind of just are ingrained in me and I kind of like Oh, I thought I kind of got over this, but I haven't like I don't know like this night, so this is kind of embarrassing but. I don't know ever since I was like in like sixth grade, I guess, like i've always wanted to be like be like have like me like a popular artists like yeah and like it was like a huge goal for me and honestly, it was i'm not gonna lie kind of like took over me. And I think the reason why is because. I at the time when I want gone to sixth grade um I went to a private school. And I yeah when I started private school I even like just throughout middle school in high school I just didn't have friends, really. be friends, so I just felt kind of like lonely in a sense. Also, like I don't know my parents also weren't involved in Mike my like what I was interested in. So it was just kind of like I wanted to find like an outlet to share my work. And that's what I did I had like an instagram and other yeah just an instagram and I would post my art, but I guess i've always had this sense of envy for people who like are like really successful with like I guess social media and. Just in general, just like being an artist and it's like is now like now it's it's getting better because, like I kind of i'm in a state where I believe that if they like if someone else can do that thing I can do it too."
759.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
16996.0,Patient,"And that, like it does take a lot of work there's like a lot of. Like things that people don't show in their life because um. yeah cuz like because he cannot he only see the good parts on social media."
759.0,Provider,yeah you're. Missing parts.
16996.0,Patient,"um so I tend to try to read that but I don't know sometimes when I see someone's like success or like they just come up all of a sudden, you know, or even if it's like a friend like I I feel very happy for them. But at the same time i'm like I wish there were me. i'm just like. yeah yes, I just feel like so impatient and i'm trying to not be like i'm trying to just kind of enjoy the process and not care so much about being famous. Because like yeah like it does help having a social media presence presence, it does help and your career but um it shouldn't be the main goal. and thankfully I think i'm kind of starting to shift out of that because lately i've just been I don't know, like last year I was having a hard time with art in general. Just just because it was just a very stressful year, but it was a very it was very good for my growth, I definitely i'd like transformed as a person, and I also like and there's a lot of moments, where I was like scared but I was like you know. I guess I subconsciously believe that I needed to choose like faith over fear. yeah I was just like I have to like just believe that you know, things will work out, and you know thought would will make everything work out. And they did, and like it, they did like they in ways I didn't even I couldn't wouldn't have imagined back then. yeah um I was it was it going so sorry for. um. I don't remember a."
759.0,Provider,"question I haven't question. Why so embarrassed about. You know, wanting to be famous."
16996.0,Patient,"I don't know I guess like I don't know cuz like maybe I think it's because, like at least I know like there's like a lot of people are like when I remember, I used to be like. um what was what did I do like I would say, like people on there's some not everyone but there's a few artists i've seen. You know Karen there who maybe they've got been asked about that, and they mentioned that they kind of answer that question and or they say like you know fame doesn't matter, you should just focus on the process and focus on what's like happening now, I guess, basically."
759.0,Provider,yeah.
16996.0,Patient,"What you're doing and not necessarily like the end result, because you know because, like people will be attracted to who you are, if you keep putting in the work essentially like the body of work. yeah and yeah but I don't know I guess I just feel embarrassed because I feel like I don't know like I should feel more mature about it, I was like."
759.0,Provider,I had that mindset.
16996.0,Patient,"yeah um and I do, I am start I am like definitely starting to but I definitely have moments still like I think oh yeah oh yeah another thing that's also tied into it. um I think a couple of the out like before last week i've been feeling kind of down just for a couple of weeks, because it was like yeah and it didn't. Work yeah yeah yeah oh no well that was last week."
759.0,Provider,Last week.
16996.0,Patient,"Okay, I mean before that, but I just stealing down just because i'm I don't know I feel like I was just feeling like oh yeah like I was seeing, like all my friends and they've been all like kind of like MIA like. thing and it kind of felt like lonely and I also and you know, I was feeling lonely because I was just like I mean I am I was, I mean, I still am like i'm working on like learning new skills and stuff. Like related to our and I was, I guess, I was also frustrated with that because I was not really understanding stuff so it was kind of not I was kind of like. i'm kind of focusing on like what I didn't have basically."
759.0,Provider,"Okay, what the didn't happen can do yeah."
16996.0,Patient,And yeah but I don't know I guess. that's like some I don't think it's weird but I like I say like two weeks ago I like started I started listening to like. yeah I started listening to like affirmations.
759.0,Provider,on YouTube oh good.
16996.0,Patient,"um but they're like in the. what's like they're in the like. They basically appear as like subliminally essentially so maybe. You do. Maybe and there's like you hear rain sounds but there's actually a subliminal in the background, and it has a bunch of affirmations. And yeah like people usually list them, just like they say all the things that they say. That list them. out yeah it helped me so much like it was so weird like a felt like I just changed like. I don't know I just."
759.0,Provider,worked on your sub conscience.
16996.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah um. yeah like I feel like a lot more confident now and, just like I feel. Like I can achieve things cuz. i'm I don't know like I guess I yeah during that time, where I was feeling bad like I was just like questioning like like my like the things I was doing like was like. I was just like wasn't I felt kind of lost basically and actually that's what I was feeling like most of last year with art like I was feeling lost, and like I just felt like all the things that I thought I wanted to do were kind of changing. My life. Just interesting stuff have been changing, and you know that is definitely a normal thing as like as you get older. But it kind of made me feel scared because I felt I felt like for the longest time I I thought I knew exactly what I wanted to do like."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16996.0,Patient,"And like or I guess with an art, because I still am pursuing art. Like that's definitely like my one number one but um. yeah like within our I was kind of like shifting interests, and it was like I don't know, I was starting to feel a lot yeah like lost because I just didn't know what to do with that information, I guess, and those those those feelings. But um yeah but. I then started, I believe, like. yeah it was end of November, I like lots of courses on things that like programs, I wanted to learn and. yeah and yeah At first it has been really hard because it's just complicated, but actually I don't know if it's maybe what the subliminal but, in the past week it really I just completely just like things are just clicking for me like I just learn learning super fast. Good like I learned I don't know I like it so were you thinking about last week in terms of like my progress with learning this stuff because I look I look I knew a lot less and like I was so confused at some like certain fundamentals, but now I understand, like all of them."
759.0,Provider,Oh good good progress girl.
16996.0,Patient,"that's great yeah i'm super happy about that and i've been really excited like just working on this stuff because it makes me feel like I just I don't know I guess my sense of passionate art has kind of juvenile justice because, like. me feeling lost like a made me feel I was just wasn't past like yeah I was shifting interest because I realized things that I wanted to do it isn't like I just wasn't passionate about it anymore."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16996.0,Patient,"But I mean i've been kind of. Not like not making like a well I guess on pinterest I just can and also just like me learning this new new skills like it's like i'm starting to kind of visualize a new body of work that I can work on and I haven't had that happen in a lot of the wild and it's just. inspiration yeah inspiration. yeah and like it may be, want to learn a lot of new things that could help me even like better accomplish that goal. um yeah so yeah thankfully in the last week i've started to feel better, in a sense, where I felt like I was like Okay, I have my own thing that i'm working on and it's going well and I just talked to keep going at it on, so the I guess I guess it was that feeling was follow cuz."
759.0,Provider,fearless now hey.
16996.0,Patient,"yeah like that cuz I was just like I don't know, like all the people I was being like all the people I knew were really busy with their own thing, and I was just like I don't know I feel kind of just like i'm just saying I don't know."
759.0,Provider,If you yeah just be.
16996.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
759.0,Provider,"Going by with the flow, you want to be in the Max. doing things keeping up. yeah and I also want to."
16996.0,Patient,Make sure i'm enjoying it because. Like I don't know. Like my oh sorry.
759.0,Provider,I said that's important to enjoy things you know your your work yeah.
16996.0,Patient,"yeah definitely because, like I don't know I just like I don't know I I, I guess, like the feeling of having your heart set on fire is like my favorite thing just being super passionate about something. Like obviously that's not going to be every day because it kind of waxes and wanes but. I just can't imagine myself doing something that i'm like kind of feeling lukewarm about because it will i'll eventually just burn out. So that's why I was worried because I was just like oh my gosh like art was the number one thing. yeah still is, and like our lease for what I want to pursue in life, and I was like confused at what to do. um but I mean, I still don't really know for sure, but I have like I just kind of have a new sense of yeah like inspiration like. i'm like. kind of like realizing like i'm going a different direction but it's like a good direction. And i'm and i'm really happy about that, but yeah I do still struggle with comparing myself to others. i'm just like sometimes like I hear like a friend oh like they got like an internship. or like another friend like they got like this job offer that's like so great like. And i'm like. I don't know it's it feels I just feel like I mean i'm know i'm trying to be patient and. But it's just really difficult cuz like. yeah that was me but i'm happy for them, but I will have."
759.0,Provider,That opportunity to. To get. New internship by get a job offer yeah.
16996.0,Patient,"cuz like because, like even though, like yeah i'm in school still and but I haven't like done. Like I don't know or I kind of feel like every year and started from square one, and somewhere for me."
759.0,Provider,Okay.
16996.0,Patient,"Like where i'm like okay i'm going to do this thing and then the thing i'm supposed to do doesn't turn out the way I wanted it to so like, for example, me making a portfolio. Like I think oh yeah it was 2020 like in the fall, I was, I had the. term off, and I was like you know i'm going to make a portfolio and then in the spring, like next year, I mean last spring I was going to like apply for internships and all that and it didn't work that way I did make a lot of art, though. But I didn't end up applying to internships just because. yeah like the work that I needed to do for at least the for the thing I wanted to do at the time I just was like I didn't know how to approach it and I was just like so like I felt like frozen, but I did make a lot of art and I yeah I was being very consistent with that."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16996.0,Patient,But um.
759.0,Provider,I have a question. yeah RT.
16996.0,Patient,Oh um I do digital or like digital painting.
759.0,Provider,Oh okay painting with the tablet okay good.
16996.0,Patient,"yeah he's like an art program and yeah and I also have an iPad where you said apple pencil to draw. yeah. Nice um yeah yeah I I like yeah i'm definitely like interested in like the animation industry. Or, I have been. A while. I guess something i've thought about for a while, like free like even like the time throughout high school college was just like. figuring out how would I integrate in that industry because I don't know cuz like the things i'm like I have like such nice interests but it's like really hard to pinpoint where exactly that's going to fit I guess. And i'm like I don't know cuz like for me like i'm not like I love the work that comes from like animation. On, but I also am not I don't like like I don't like like certain cartoons like Disney like, if I were to work at Disney I don't know i'll feel weird. Being like no actually like Disney or like anything Disney at all. So i'm just like and like yeah so i'm just like I don't know um but and that's like now even now i'm like I don't even know like i'm just like. I don't even know where to even go, but I guess I have, I have talked to a friend she's actually she was actually my my art teacher in high school, but we still keep in touch regularly um. And I told her like i'm super passionate about this thing i'm learning and she's like you know it, you should follow that and you should like put your like heart and like put your all into it, because, like it could it's going to definitely take you in a good place."
759.0,Provider,Oh good.
16996.0,Patient,"And I was like you know yeah I think i'm going to. just focus on that because yeah because, like thinking me thinking about the future, it is scary because i'm just like i'm like. i'm kind of a mess, right now, in a sense of I don't even know what exactly I don't have like specific goals. When it comes to like. career or. Specific yeah specific goals and like a specific place, I want to work at and all that it's just unlike kind of just like. i'm just kind of I mean not necessarily I guess I guess going with the flow but it's like I don't know I enter explain it it's not in a sense of like me not like carrying or not like having any sense of structure at all. yeah it's just i'm just kind of going along with what I feel like will like my driving force, I guess, like what Ben will take me essentially. So that's what's going to kind of keeping me calm about not think to shut up the future because. I get really scared about that. But. yeah but I mean I yeah I did yeah like I was mentioning before, but I, I do believe in like things working out the way it should."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16996.0,Patient,"Because like yeah I had a friend who got hired for a company, a few months ago and it's like a like a huge company or like it's huge for within. The I guess. The thing yeah The thing that he's like doing I guess is it's like a big company. And then it's like like he's really enjoying it and i'm like wow like because, like because yeah because, like at my school like there's a lot of graduates and they're all trying to get the same thing. But you know this obviously like there's definitely not a lot of like there's like limited spaces, because you know, having like a few hundred people graduating every semester it's like. there's only there's only so many spots that's gonna have, or at least in that."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16996.0,Patient,That given time so it's very competitive um. But um yeah I just i'm also going to say i'm. Sorry i'm like I feel like I ramble.
759.0,Provider,it's okay it's okay i'll take rambling I mean I don't think it's rambling me you're just talking so.
16996.0,Patient,"yeah yeah um but. yeah, but I think I know so like some of the things that has making me feel good recently is just like it is related to what i'm doing like yeah I remember. yeah it was on Saturday I was asking a friend, if she wanted to hang out and like. Like do a video call. The Games and then so then like a few people join the call and like. I don't know what. What what led into it, but I just I guess I mentioned out like hey i'm like learning the software. And i'm like really enjoying is so fun. And because, like they are also familiar with that software, like everyone in school because it's very it's because, like it's a 3D like program and like an animation and stuff like they use it for all the time. So they're familiar with it, but not a lot of people, I know, like I don't know anyone who's learning it. yeah so i'm kind of the one i'm only the only one kind of just figuring things out myself but um. yeah I was like I kind of basically do like a little DEMO. mm hmm like one of the friends, I had like she was like interested because she was like oh wow like because, like she wanted to like. learn certain parts that she was super confused about and I kind of basically like showed her like the basics of it, and she was just like super like interest to like. Oh, like oh my gosh live you're gonna go you're getting into a girl boss."
759.0,Provider,that's good.
16996.0,Patient,"Oh it's sort of happy because I was just like oh my gosh. that's so exciting, I mean maybe that's gonna happen. um yeah and also another thing that happened was like so i'm i'm on Twitter and I have a little bit of a presence it's not like huge. I have some mutual like followers on there that big follow each other. One of them like he is like he made me like a very small list of people he wanted to work with, and they had like it had like a bunch of big names and it had me in."
759.0,Provider,yeah.
16996.0,Patient,"Like that Community because it's a very niche community but they're like definitely there is like that hierarchy of like who's popular. uh huh, I guess, but like. He yeah he was like oh my because I mean I remember, he said he wanted to collab with me. But I don't know it just never happened but he's like an artist, too, by the way. But he's like I don't know in the past he's always said that I was his favorite artists and it's just like your. She said, like my art is like what he's inspired like as far as to do."
759.0,Provider,Oh wow.
16996.0,Patient,"So interesting but yeah she was he was like yeah like yeah he he wanted to do it, she wants to do a collab with me, so I don't know when that's gonna happen, but. He was like this is like a goal that I want to do this year and. yeah I guess like. i've been feeling good, in a sense, lately of like just I don't know I feel like I don't know what it is, but I I don't know I feel like if I continue the direction i'm going in something good is going to happen. yeah you know when that's going to happen, or what will happen, I don't know what like anything but I just I don't know I just have this feeling, because I don't know I just believe in signs, I guess, and like things happening and you're like."
759.0,Provider,favor and.
16996.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yeah like I don't know like yeah so um. yeah I guess yeah I had been definitely excited about it and um but yeah I still definitely do have the struggle of like just being trying to follow the process because, like. Because like yeah it's very much like. it's very much like what sort of like. You know, like wanting to be at the end it's like that's The thing that you want the most."
759.0,Provider,yeah I want like really badly.
16996.0,Patient,"But, like the process of getting better it feels like it's taking a long time, and you don't really know what's going to happen. So it's like. I don't know like one like I may like maybe i'll I do think I do absolutely believe I will find a place in the like in just the art world in general, but I just don't know when and how those things will take those events will take place. And it got. It makes me like anxious, I guess, and i'm trying not to be that I don't I don't try not to be as anxious um."
759.0,Provider,"Well, I think you hit the nail on the hammer we said to enjoy the process right as much as possible. Like regardless of you know, like getting to the end. enjoying what you're doing being passionate about what you're doing now in like and staying in the moment. yeah as much as possible and just enjoying the moment you know yeah and in the end you don't know what's going to happen, but you you hope you know for the best outcome but to enjoy yourself, you know. While you're making art. and have that kind of like flame lit you know in you know, for your art that passion."
16996.0,Patient,"Right yeah exactly yeah that's actually kind of like I actually something I started recently was like what those supplemental like videos this. Like very like very good break because they have like rain sounds so I just like kind of take five minutes or so. And so my headphones and just kind of meditate I guess on my bed. that's good, because I feel like I don't know I feel like it's kind of is a productive for me it's the productive way of meditating because. You have those affirmations click enter in your subconscious mind and they're also listening to something it's like quiet like you can't hear anything. Because it's got a little so you're listening to just like rain, or whatever white noise. And you're just kind of. Just yeah just being in the moment and. Not and like blooding thoughts past five but not get too involved with them yeah yeah i'm trying to do that it's it's really hard because, like my mind goes like 100 million. miles per hour all the time. And I just i'm always just thinking about things. But i'm trying to do that more and. yeah."
759.0,Provider,"yeah once you do feel proud of yourself and challenging yourself, you know to be doing this new software, you know and learning new things, and you should be proud of yourself and challenging yourself."
16996.0,Patient,"yeah actually I was, I was just thinking about that, today, actually, because I was just like because I I started learning a lot of stuff just like really fast recently and. It just it gave me the the huge like I guess hi. Good emotion, because I was just like wow this is this program that i've been meaning i've been wanting to learn, or like this type of our i've been wanting to learn for literally years and i'm doing it, not only that, unlike at making stuff with it too and. yeah it's like It made me feel so good, like because, like before in the past i've struggled with it because it's just there's like kind of like that barrier and the very like like is the barrier of like not really knowing where to start. feeling overwhelmed by. Like all the things you have to learn, but I had been taking like something i've been trying to tell myself is to like. Like you don't like you know not to like learn everything all at once, just if you've learned like if i've learned something in the day, then that's good enough and i'm trying to like remember that because, like you know it's like baby steps basically."
759.0,Provider,eps.
16996.0,Patient,"yeah cuz I I think I listened to, like or no, no, I didn't listen to the podcast but there was like an article that link to podcast I didn't listen to it, yet, but it was basically saying that, like a way to be patient is to basically like. um don't not think about everything all at once, which is the little things like little things that you do every day because they eventually add up."
759.0,Provider,"Yes, yes."
16996.0,Patient,I think some that's something that's kind of like i'm starting to like understand a bit. cuz i'm yeah because.
759.0,Provider,Like it more progress is still progress. yeah at least to the goal.
16996.0,Patient,"yeah yeah cuz I used to be so hard on myself like for doing for not doing certain things, or for not following a certain path, or whatever like just in general for just a lot of things and not doing things the way I should or not doing things at the same time."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16996.0,Patient,"But yeah i'm this I think i'm starting to learn that, like. yeah like even if you try to be try so much to be like someone else like your path is going to still be different."
759.0,Provider,yeah you're still going to be different.
16996.0,Patient,"yeah even if you're pursuing the same thing, like it's still going to have twists and turns."
759.0,Provider,Their unique cuts yes. To nothing nothing's linger has always has twists and turns yeah.
16996.0,Patient,"Right yeah and yeah I think that's a huge lesson i've been i've been learning and I still am not perfect, with it, but it's kind of the concept is starting to sink in I think. yeah um but what oh yeah I was something I think something else that kind of is basically is very similar is like. I had, I had a friend, I have a friend who lives in New York and oh yeah the reason why I okay another reason why I remember a side thing you were saying why you feel embarrassed about wanting to be famous. I think another reason is because. um so I have this friend in New York, we we we hung out a lot, but obviously since moving back. To California, since last year we haven't really. been keeping in touch but um I don't know I like I love her as a friend, and I think she's very she's a wonderful friend. But also, I don't know I, something that has bothered me about her is just her like she would always like she has like a huge I don't know she's very like she has like a huge ego. And she tends to like basically put herself on a pedestal a lot and like she was like always focused on like wanting to be famous basically like wants to be like the same as artists and have this like mentality of like oh man, I have so many people flocking to me. Like. And like you know I think it's like kudos to her, but I think that mindset kind of started was like kind of affecting me too. yeah or. Because it just I don't know I like. Because I don't know i've always been bothered by it and I couldn't really pinpoint why I think, is the reason why is because I just like that's not the only thing to it, I guess, like. And like I mean yeah like again like it does help you know, to have you know, a presence online and to so you can connect with others, but it's like not the end all be all basically. And that kind of like when I would talk to her it kind of always like I always slipped back into that like mindset again, and it was just such a it was really hard to like kind of get out of it because it made me feel kind of like. what's the word kind of like. Oh, my gosh i'm like okay like I guess the term cloud chaser. made me feel like I was that and. I don't want to be that."
759.0,Provider,Be that yeah.
16996.0,Patient,"I want yeah I just I want to like. If I were to be popular in line at some point in my life. I want it, because I want people to see that the things I do is stuff i'm passionate about. And I want. to share that with others. And, not because I want some service. To have some sort of status symbol. yeah I think. Like when I would like to hang out with her and she would talk about stuff in that manner, like. It just kind of I don't know it bothered me and it kind of like. sent me back I guess cuz. I yeah cuz like I guess the things i've been learning has it's been currently hard to learn, because of just things that are like mindsets that just really ingrained. And I just like it's really hard to shake off, I guess, especially if it's started from childhood i'm like yeah I really like I wanted to be popular on social media because I didn't like when I was in middle school and high school is because I didn't really have friends in real life. And I didn't really tell people to connect with. So I. yeah I just I was like well if i'm not pop or if i'm not I don't have that in real life than I could have that online and that's why I was just so like hard on myself, and I would compare myself so much to people during that time, like I would be super like I. wanted that so bad. I mean. As the years have gone by sides it become less and less like. You know. yeah yeah but um yeah I I just like. I don't know I just don't want to get caught up in that mindset too much because I just don't want to become like conceited. or self centered. I want, because, like, I do believe in serving others in the sense. Like and I don't want to like be like self absorbed I guess and not I mean not that I guess I wouldn't i'm not naturally like that, but it's can he can still kind of like get caught up in that. and actually."
759.0,Provider,Like.
16996.0,Patient,"yeah, especially if you have a lot of success and a lot of like privilege, I guess i'm in some sort of way so and also with that same friend like I guess like. because she would brag i'm not gonna lie I would. also be jealous because, like or like envious because, like I just like I don't know I just. Because like she has this like I will say like she has this sense of confidence that's like super like it is respectable and like I wanted that for a long time, I think i'm starting to kind of get that now. But um. yeah I don't know I guess like having her achieve things and me, being in like a low place was just like really hard to deal with. But um. But I. Was I guess I don't know. Oh, my gosh I don't know I keep forgetting things. um."
759.0,Provider,Take your time has okay.
16996.0,Patient,"um. yeah I just like. yeah I don't know, I just want to like able to have like a sense of balance. And not. Put like everything in one area all my like i'm not explain it."
759.0,Provider,"To someone the as like yeah. But you want to be more balanced, even though, like King, can I say something every day, your friend is confident or she's you know, like has just kind of Center bar her that is kind of play. and basically the shit in like high altitude, you know, but you want to be want more balance in terms of how you view yourself how other people be. yourself and being more kind of like yeah i'm good at, why do by also and you know, like this caring person like it's not all always all about me. yeah it's about the work, the work. it's about the art i'm doing so yeah I can see that that difference."
16996.0,Patient,"yeah that's exactly it yeah. You gotta do much better than I did. yeah um but yeah that's exactly it because yeah I don't um. yeah I do want yeah I definitely want to like know myself and be confident in who I am and what I do but yeah I do want the I do have other qualities that are not my art. And like. Like if people were to know me like, if I had an audience and they were to know me like. They I want them to know that I am maybe if they had an image in their head before knowing about me or like I don't want them to have like a specific thing. or I guess perception of me that might be completely different from who I actually am. yeah I guess I guess i'm basically saying, I just want to be myself yeah."
759.0,Provider,"i'd be yourself yeah be yourself and don't have to put on a dish you know the show other people like a you know, like a image of you, like you, you just want to be yourself, like you, don't have to. You know what's the word comma far edge who you are, you know father's for other people to like you."
16996.0,Patient,"Right yeah yeah exactly yeah I definitely don't want that. yeah um but yeah, I think, though, I will say I think I like a lesson just I guess in the process of learning is that, like those things things i'm thinking about like i'm just saying, and I want basically like they will come in time. I do believe that um it's it's just I kind of have to be present, right now, and just like really focus like and also like there's a saying, where like if you're like. In a race like a like a horse race or something you don't like or like just anything if you're a racist some sort or a look you don't look at the other person or like you don't look too pure be hot like. yeah person, because it makes you distracted. yeah um and I struggle with that sometimes sometimes i'm like i'm going to go on social media and then I spend. Like 30 minutes or hours obsessing over this one person and i'm like oh my gosh she talented and so good at everything that I know someone like that my school like she's like super talented and she's like it's like everything she does she does perfectly. But um yeah I mean i'm not I mean I used to be hugely like envious for, but now i'm not anymore, just because I guess i'm finding my own individuality. But um and also like just my the things that happened to me are definitely not comparable to anyone else's life, I mean I don't mean like saying that different but more of like i've have had my struggles. yeah like. Finances yeah like especially like mental health and stuff. And it's has like definitely made it hard, but so yeah I have to like definitely try to compare myself for getting this far, despite those."
759.0,Provider,"yeah yeah you do have to commend yourself and getting so far, despite your mental health challenges that you have had. I only agree with that statement."
16996.0,Patient,yeah definitely. yeah and yeah i'm just yeah so it's basically just have those blinders on and just focus on what I do focus.
759.0,Provider,"focus on yourself, you know what you're doing, because what you're doing it's amazing itself, you know, like you're a strong artists in your own right, you know so focusing on what you're doing. yeah yeah and don't look to the side don't want to love don't look, you know just keep a little bit of TV."

The past year, because I just I don't know but just a lot of stuff happening, but, like, I guess, in terms of like scrolling through my feed i'm starting to do that less just because. It every time I do it there's always something or some person that comes up and it makes me feel bad about myself i'm like i'm just like oh my God like Why am I not what Why am I not doing what they're doing I guess. yeah that."
759.0,Provider,So i've been posting your own learn to control it sounds amazing. So make sure that you're posting your stuff.

And I like at least last year it was the first time, where I was like yeah I felt completely uninstalled like I just couldn't think of any ideas and it was just such a strange thing strange thing for me because. i've always been like I guess creative and had so many different ideas I always have a list of things I want to draw. In or like. But it at like last year just kind of went flat and, but it was, I think it was definitely for a good reason, like I just am shifting and changing as a person and as an artist. Like because, like yeah like, as you have life experiences look you're not going to be the same person as you were and also like isn't general a lot of people who go to school, not just art school like their bill study one thing, but they might pursue something else. Like or like. I don't know like, at least in my case, like, I have, I know people who like maybe they studied how to do comics or they studied like. I don't know like 3D animation but they go into another field and art like storyboarding or I don't know like graphic design whatever just random examples, but but yeah I you know but hearing that I remember like. Oh yeah like I remember, I went to a thanksgiving thing, like my roommates family She invited me to that a fencing and, like her daughter's boyfriend works at nickelodeon like he's like he's willing the animation field. Does like the bookstore library so basically setting up the scenes. Like drafting the scenes of what what the animation and yeah I got to talk with him and his friends, and it was just really is very insightful like yeah that's what I heard when I heard like yeah they studied one thing, but they're in a little bit of a different like. That you know they had different interest over time within art."

Essentially accumulated over the years, like an attachment to them about and probably in the moment it's making her feel better, so I just felt really horrible and I just felt like I was just like.
