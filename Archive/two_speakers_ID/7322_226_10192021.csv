226.0,Provider,"Okay, why okay so tell me how you feel it's not healthy."
7322.0,Patient,well. A. So I experienced a lot of like traumas with this. last major relationship last year. and It was like a lifetime ago but. I have like dreams and stuff so. Like shooting a been being with that. And then being nice to me at all or nothing it's just like nightmares.
226.0,Provider,Do you remember what do you know what that nightmares are about.
7322.0,Patient,"One was very specific and I remember very well um. I woke up in her parents house with her and in the bedroom that we would stay in. Whenever we would go and visit her parents and. I walked downstairs and I talked to her mom her mom was like it was like I was there. After We broke up or something you know, like it was just back there and it was just crazy um. Lots of emotional like I don't remember any of the conversations now, but it was just linked, a lot of focus for call back or back and forth, and then we went out to. mom's car mom drove me home pretty much. like ours."
226.0,Provider,And how long are you in this relationship with this person.
7322.0,Patient,I feel like year and i'm months I didn't really keep tabs but. I think that's what was.
226.0,Provider,Your What was your relationship monthly. charts was that band.
7322.0,Patient,"It was very. Very centered around drugs, alcohol tattoos like sadomasochism you know and whole bunch of. craziness and partying and not thinking of just like you know and. She cheated on me. And it was a weird time we just went on a cruise together and. I thought we had a really good time together and we get to know each other very well one. That didn't happen, she cheated on me with my best friend. I didn't know for. All so she is just kind of like I didn't even know herself, I thought you know, like pretty sure you know. But I continued on with the relationship and because. I love the person and to go through therapy and everything and. She wanted to work with me like. It was very cheeky begged me to stay in the relationship and everything. And I just was like whatever. and So it's not. The end of the world, I guess you know. person could have gotten killed, you know. um but other than that. So relationship continued, it can be him very toxic and the only time either one of us was happy was chasing effects. um. It was just weird so. My understanding generalized lot of this Chair and understand my. Mother bought. me some a lot of the times is that it feels. Like. responsible for other person. metamorphosis in life and. A. hurts me because I feel responsible for that person you down but i'm not responsible for them their their own person their own actions you know they don't choose on they feel. it's just like. I introduced him to very. dark. World you know."
226.0,Provider,So do you feel like you are the one that introduced her to to drugs. And okay to that darker side okay.
7322.0,Patient,"yeah there's like she wanted to do all that so. They kind of was just weird for me yeah. Looking back at it her leaving me for girl kicking me out of where we're living and gave me a couple of trash bags. It was crazy she wanted me our that was blake paid off, I was like Fuck crazy person, you know wasn't going to do any of that so."
226.0,Provider,"So remember chase that anytime that you're in a relationship where there's a lot of drugs addiction, a lot of alcohol that's really not a healthy relationship."
7322.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"it's just it's really basically impossible. To have a healthy relationship when. one or both, or even like actively thing."
7322.0,Patient,"I was a high functioning addict for very long time and job, the whole time."
226.0,Provider,yeah I.
7322.0,Patient,"Just don't understand. Why a lot of my actions, back then, I also tried to kill myself after relationship ended soon as the. language. I don't want to take out. How I feel on anybody in my present or future you know. For my pet. Like make has a will have to move past. Just one. wanna she'll be happy and enjoy the moment."
226.0,Provider,"You know right. So you know just by talking about a you're actually healing and by going to group you're actually working on. working through these things that have been you know that are that it feels dark to. The past feels dark. So let me read something really quick, I found this it says dreaming of someone shooting up drugs implies that others are not seeing things from your angle. We don't understand where others are coming from and feel that your perspective is skewed alternatively between means that you have been helpful. In a situation and don't know how to respond. And also. This came up to drug dreams are observable that are observable phenomenon that reflect both the innate structure the brain and neural changes produced by exposure to addictive drugs. In some addicted persons exposure to god's produces and six change in neurological function with which they may not, they must contend with for years, possibly for us to their lives and I don't know about."
7322.0,Patient,That like.
226.0,Provider,That doesn't sound right that doesn't resonate with me.
7322.0,Patient,Well there's Lee. How I am. Very visual person I guess.
226.0,Provider,And then.
7322.0,Patient,or something so it's like flashes.
226.0,Provider,"I mean you know that have you heard that before that it's, it is very common for people to have Dr James as mainstream yeah and the first year of sobriety like really, really, really common."
7322.0,Patient,"Interest in them. it's a very different from the reality, I guess. I guess different from my experience, like my dreams. we're racing against, but other than that um. Whenever I moved I moved. To Texas near San Antonio and braunfels."
226.0,Provider,i've been to.
7322.0,Patient,near LM gordo i'm living in Anthony right now but i'm. kind of made me angry and bitter you know.
226.0,Provider,They had to leave her house your ex girlfriend spouse.
7322.0,Patient,knows her house or an apartment together and. Shared all the bills. it's just. cuz i'd gone through doing drugs and everything I lost my best friend Terry and the mean her went through doing all drugs up the ladder goes like stupid. So.
226.0,Provider,So do you have you have shame guilt yeah. yeah yeah.
7322.0,Patient,"Those. are responsible for. Introducing. Probably Linda to experience it. And that perspective, you know their own perspective, not at that time, possibly just sucked but. Other than that. She asked me on till I get drugs do drugs and like she wanted to do those drugs. And I did too so. Whatever. Just like that person kept on trying to just leave me and leave me. Oh yeah. what's weird is. Legal for now I didn't know her birthday was for a couple months after a matter, the chances are they the same birthday, but she's older than my other girl friend my ex girlfriend and he. tripped me out and I started noticing the link. there's a lot of. things to do let's similar."
226.0,Provider,mm hmm.
7322.0,Patient,"that's not the same person at all. it's just. But anyways. Well i'm trying to think about is like it's not her any other person there be with probably their notice these things like stupid shit and it wouldn't matter because it's not bad that's like. Everybody is all like, in a certain. way we see what we want to see in people. You know. Really. that's what I mean Li mo and they get out of. The past. or."
226.0,Provider,What.
7322.0,Patient,What and then what.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so what's one way, you can get out of the past, like what, what do you think of the one way, you can stop thinking about."
7322.0,Patient,"No, no, no, like talk about it is."
226.0,Provider,"And when you start to go in the past, you start to bring yourself back to the present moment when you find your thoughts are floating back to you know those situations and events. Things that are uncomfortable start thinking about the present moment like ground yourself in the present moment."
7322.0,Patient,Okay.
226.0,Provider,You know what I mean when I say ground yourself in the present yeah okay.
7322.0,Patient,Okay.
226.0,Provider,yeah so do that and just keep practicing doing that and doing it and doing it again.
7322.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you."
226.0,Provider,yeah and also sometimes it does help to journal about how you're feeling okay so journaling can also be very cathartic and you're right talking about it now is a way of not having to live it absolutely. So if you're into journaling if that's something that you feel like resonates with you that might be something you can try to.
7322.0,Patient,"Okay i'll try it i've. never done it for my life, maybe like to try to start with my dreams, or something."
226.0,Provider,"I would start writing down your dreams absolutely. And there is a you can go, you can Google dream interpretation and it will it will."
7322.0,Patient,Dear is Sigmund Freud you shouldn't like that. Some of his. dream interpretations. you're very.
226.0,Provider,"Absolutely. Absolutely. So there's Those are some things a couple of things that you can try and I would absolutely start writing down your dreams that's very helpful to because usually your dreams. are really an indication of the stress that you're experiencing or areas of your life that feel a little bit stressful or you're off balance. For those, then you know how like okay so okay that makes sense by work on this, you know I might start to feel a little bit better so it's a great way to. it's you know your dreams are your subconscious coming up to the conscious level. Your subconscious is what you know that's that's underneath right the subconscious is what we're like we don't we don't think or see that subconscious right."
7322.0,Patient,mm hmm.
226.0,Provider,The one that's coming up to the surface in your dreams that's telling you areas of your life that are a little bit unbalanced or stresses that are happening.
7322.0,Patient,Okay. Okay.
226.0,Provider,"So why don't you start with those whoops kind of take it, step by step. Also, if you are inclined chase you can go back to the virtual clinic if you want to get that medication worked out it's up to you."
7322.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"Alright, so let's set another appointment for a couple weeks of that sound."
