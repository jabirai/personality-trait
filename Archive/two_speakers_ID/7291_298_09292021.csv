298.0,Provider,"Which brings me to your medications you're on this drop propranolol and Sunday attacks, how are they all working for you."
7291.0,Patient,"um the subby textures working fantastic the other to the other two are. I don't know I can't I can't I don't know I tried i've tried them down. I tried them a different couple of ways, and they just they like they make my. head spin and I don't know they just make me feel awful like i've tried cutting them down have waited a couple of days and just think something's going on and. I don't know what it is, I told my therapist and the calendar, I was you know he's getting me a wound up and stuff because I just got so much going on lobstering and and other stuff and you know nothing too bad or whatever just you know regular stuff and. And she was like you know how about trying like a different category, you know, like, I was like yeah I know I don't know um. So he was talking about that."
298.0,Provider,um. I think that if you. If the if they don't work you shouldn't take them um I think we need to look at a different category main has extreme restrictions on doing anything like a benzodiazepine but what about a tiny dose of an anti psychotic there's several of them that have calm that calms the brain down. I have you tried any of them.
7291.0,Patient,um I don't think I don't think so.
298.0,Provider,"Okay. Oh shoot I just meant to DC your visceral and your propranolol and instead of DC I renewed them so i'm trying to cancel the prescription right now okay i'm me. So check to make sure that they don't send those to you again. Okay, and as far as. calming the brain down when is it that you have the worst time."
7291.0,Patient,"it's well it's actually a couple times like in the in the mornings, and then like the afternoons, and like like I don't talk to very many people like. You know I I can hold it, you know I can hold it pretty well they gather, but like when i'm by myself it's it's it's just I don't know it's like outrageous I don't I don't talk to very much people they just. I live in a small area so everyone knows, everyone has a lot of like gossip hate ton of stuff and, like the grocery store is only like two walks away so like I see all these you know all these feet boy just that's like that's like where I am but. i'm. yeah."
298.0,Provider,how's your sleep.
7291.0,Patient,"um it. It varies I means i'll have i'll get a second where I might get a few seconds and then. You know I might just be you know just so like stressed and. pumped about a few things I might not be able to get to sleep, it depends on the day i'm certainly having."
298.0,Provider,Okay.
7291.0,Patient,"um but ya know you know you guys like like when I see my friends like that's what i'm like I feel like I don't even have anything you know, like going on, but you know after I get off it's a different story."
298.0,Provider,"Okay. You almost have to trust me here you almost have to say, I will try it I if it doesn't work for me that's fine you let me know. And if that doesn't work we'll try something I have two different ideas, one is a little zyprexa at bedtime and the other is gabba penton what are your thoughts about either one of them, and would you like to need to explain what each one of them is."
7291.0,Patient,i'm gonna go ahead and explain each one of them myth.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so zyprexa is a very sedating. Anti psychotic used at a very small dose it doesn't have a lot of side effects to it. it's used to it's an Anti psychotic that's used to calm the brain down it really helps people with sleep it if we ever want to help take care of moods it goes nicely with a antidepressant. Some people have even used it in the daytime because it gives them such a calmness in the daytime. gotcha that's that's one thing there that's one choice, the other choices gabba penton gabba penton is. used for pain also but at higher doses it's used for anxiety it's also known to take at bedtime to increase Stage three and four sleep. It is an anti-convulsants go figure medication anti seizure medicine that we use it for its anti anxiety."
7291.0,Patient,Property so don't.
298.0,Provider,"get to the top doses like 4000 milligrams and somewhere between 900 milligrams and probably 24 million hundred milligrams is where we would find the dose that would break your anxiety i'm i'm open to trying either one of them, or both of them i'm not at the same time, though."
7291.0,Patient,Right.
298.0,Provider,"That, if I save it."
7291.0,Patient,"yeah sure i'm i'm willing to try something. You know something you know different you know there's an that i'm yeah i'm willing to try any anything just because you know if it doesn't work and it's making me feel you know, like you know this kind of way then yeah i'm i'm up for trying anything."
298.0,Provider,"OK, so my suggestion is we try zyprexa at that time and let's see if getting you some sleep helps if it doesn't give you the right feeling you let me know okay. Okay um i'm gonna say take one tablet at that time. But you could take two tablets and one tablet doesn't do it, you can take two but i'm going to write the prescription for one tablet, but let me know and, if I have to increase it, I will. zyprexa i'm going to be using it more at a lower rate, but a side effect of is it can make you hungry, so if you start to gain weight you let me know because it might not be. A medicine for you, but it doesn't happen to everybody."
7291.0,Patient,Okay.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, and. Is there anything else that I can do for you today."
7291.0,Patient,i'm that no that's all I. was going to chat about.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, any suicidal or homicidal thoughts."
7291.0,Patient,"are no just you know stressed stressed out, you know a lot of anxiety for sure, but other than that no."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, I went ahead and refilled your sub you tax and sent it to the pharmacy so it's over there, when you need it."
