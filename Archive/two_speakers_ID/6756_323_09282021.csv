323.0,Provider,yeah when you yeah I can imagine. So how are you managing all of this.
6756.0,Patient,"i'm i'm doing pretty good I still been working at a homeless shelter so on on the weekends I work there and Sunday night and then I get up and go straight to my other job. i'm starting to like really get involved there I just was like cleaning out the pantry and stuff they just got a million dollar grant for homelessness in our city. wow so I yeah so it's like a big. Big move right now we're getting ready I think they're getting ready to build a new building, they said it's supposed to be 100 beds for the women and 100 beds for the men. wow right now we have like. pin so that's like really, really like super awesome I just hopefully. Because last time, like a few years ago they got a lot of money and they didn't really do everything that they were supposed to do with it i'm just hoping that they do everything that they're supposed to do with it."
323.0,Provider,"mm hmm. sounds like it's rewarding for you. Both Personally, I was this could be a really good professional time to be associated with them. yeah bro."
6756.0,Patient,"yeah so i'm excited about it, we did have an issue with a client, the other day, but the lady said I handled it well, we had an APP called the police on her and everything because. Like she said she wanted my name and the ladies names to report us so my caseworker was like here's my card, you know we're trying to help you out is he handed her the card, and then the girl waiting like NASA from her and put her finger and like broken. yeah and we had to call the COPs on her and density like called the COPs back on us and said that we saw her food stamp card, which was like a bunch of bs because nobody can use your food stamp card. So they ended up taking her to Joe and I don't know what they did with her baby because she had a baby with her with it broke my heart. Because I was like. I kept telling her just leave like I told you have to leave right now, you know you won't you won't get in trouble. And I just kept telling her I made her three big boxes of food and we gave her like a whole bunch of formula and diapers and stuff and he ended up not getting any of that stuff because he went to jail, so it kind of broke my heart, but I was like I it wasn't really my call you know."
323.0,Provider,right but It just shows how behaviors can really impact outcome.
6756.0,Patient,"yeah. And she couldn't get a regular herself like who's gonna take your baby like if you go to del R Us and thinking about that, like. It all started, because I was trying to do her intake cuz that's how they'd like get funding and."
323.0,Provider,All right.
6756.0,Patient,"And he didn't want to give me her social security number, and then the caseworker was like is there a reason you don't want to provide it and she's like yeah I don't trust off. I was gonna try to steal my identity and she said, well, if you don't trust us why are you here like we have to have that in order for you to be here, so what we came to find out was he was like already banned from there and that's why she didn't want to give us her social security number. Oh, I guess, they come there and they're like if there are any type of violent in any way like they put them on a do not return list. And that's what I was oh kind of crazy. wow yeah."
323.0,Provider,Just think of the kids going through that too.
6756.0,Patient,"I know it's really sad I just. Our our our city has like such a need like people don't realize that we have a lot of homeless people here like because our city is like so small, and they sleep on this alley so they're not like uptown where people. They don't yeah so a lot of people don't think that's a problem even exist, but you know they there's a street that they call homeless bad now because that's like where they camp out and. Oh, and now it's the winter time coming, it makes it more you know, and I just feel like we're turn we turn people away because a lot of people don't want to do their job, so they keep telling them. They don't want to do the intake so like no problem we don't have any bed when we do have that like. So I ended up like having to clean a room out because these people just left their stuff there, and there was a lady with three kids I needed a bed, and it was disgusting but I cleaned it the other day, and it took me seven hours to do it, but."
323.0,Provider,"Oh, my goodness."
6756.0,Patient,"It was it was nasty they're like we don't know how they were had a baby living in here I mean era stuff stuff to the walls climbs filled out everywhere. yeah this this unbelievable how some people live like. Right, if you would just imagine like you're in a homeless shelter you're supposed to be like you know, working on getting your House and stuff and a lot of people, just like door dash food, and you know wasting money like I just don't I don't understand that part but."
323.0,Provider,I don't yeah the cost of.

323.0,Provider,What do you think that's about for her.
6756.0,Patient,"um we'll see just started realizing that some of her friends wasn't like a real friends like you know people talking about are behind her back. Just kind of stay solo this year I told her you don't you don't have to have friends, especially I mean it's good to better find out now that they're fake instead of. going through your whole life and then you know 20 years down the line you're still friends with them like you don't want to be friends with someone that's not that good intention so. it's just hard like watching them because I gotta let them like learn. And as they're at that age, now that I kind of just let them learn on their own and it's amazing like those voices that they pick it just makes me proud, because you are you look back and you're like I had to do something right like I had to. route so. It just makes me proud about it because they're starting to be responsible, young adult."
323.0,Provider,"yeah, that is, the payback that for everything you've done those 18 or so years that they're coming up, and then you start seeing them making really good decisions for themselves."
6756.0,Patient,yeah that's what I tell them I tell them all the time i'm proud of them.
323.0,Provider,Good good.
6756.0,Patient,yeah we've had a couple more people have died from overdoses like since the last time I talked to with have probably like I think three people.
323.0,Provider,"There was, I was on yeah I had two appointments on Saturday, and they were telling me about to that had recently happened. yeah in the area i'm just like what."
6756.0,Patient,"I my sister my sister packed all her stuff and she just came here and told me that he was going to stay with a friend and the next city over because she doesn't want to do drugs anymore, so I told her I said tell me when you're like a week clean because i'm tired of hearing like. it's going to get clean. Every like we hear that two or three times a week and I guess old. Right, so I told her I said well just call me like if you need anything has but I told her cuz it do that just died was like one of her axes. And I told her yesterday didn't even know about it that's how much. Like self consumed, it is, then, when I told her about it, like SCI fi almost fainted and I, so you know you have to do like she's like i'm so scared I said well you know what you have to do you got to stop doing this day like only way around it. This dog is kind of bite me stop. It you. Know Oh, my goodness."
323.0,Provider,"I like the idea of you, putting some boundaries around that like let's not keep talking about this to you, but we clean time."
6756.0,Patient,yeah.
323.0,Provider,cuz I got a little clearer honey.
6756.0,Patient,"yeah and I guess just to the point that you want to see X men. Like you've been saying, like we don't have time right we don't have to keep listening to it like we want to see you do it. Right so. I just hope he does it I just in the back of my mind I feel like he doesn't want to stop right now, like. I don't know."
323.0,Provider,"Well, it is you and I have talked like you have a lot of fear about what might happen to her."
6756.0,Patient,that's what I.
323.0,Provider,said earlier than I think she hasn't herself but. that's part yeah so foggy.
6756.0,Patient,"I broke down crying who are the other day, when I found out that he died, I said I like I was in here, and here, as I said, I just want you to stop like. Like how much is that not doing job. well. She doesn't really know how to like be on our own he's always done that, like he's always been not one that thinks he can't be alone like he always has to be with someone. And she never liked the person who always wants to be with is like you know it's applying her drug habit so it's not."
323.0,Provider,Right.
6756.0,Patient,it's not a healthy relationship at all.
323.0,Provider,I mean. She probably has not really had a healthy relationship.
6756.0,Patient,"No, I don't think see and the guy that you know they'll guide us in treatment and stuff like he just came down here on Saturday and spent the night with her and stuff. And he that's why I said, like what are, what are your guys's plans, because you're clean he's dirty he's like i'm going to be a drug and alcohol counselor I said yeah but what who are you going to counsel like my sister. says that makes no sense to me like how are, how is this going to work. right either keep coming down here, and you know, like picking her up and take her to the movies, and act like everything is just all good, and I said you guys need to like talk about, because this is not healthy I was like is toxic."
323.0,Provider,"isn't it interesting like it, how it looks so different to you when you've had your own clean time and can get away."
6756.0,Patient,"Now that's what I told her I said, if you could even just get clean for a week, you will start to notice your brain like that fog lifted up and you'll start to be looking at your. Your choices like oh my gosh like your choices will start painting now even in that little bit of time that's what I tried to tell her like if you could even just get a week, under your belt. And then started seeing how good you feel without it like maybe you could do it never gets that far."
323.0,Provider,Right and this person she supposedly is going to is that as that somebody who's clean.
6756.0,Patient,"yeah he just he got clean like a year and a half ago and he's been clean but that's what I wonder, too, like hopefully he's not he's not going to be influencing him like What else do, that is how sick and influences him to do, drugs, because he's hasn't been clean that long it's only been. Granted, like a year. Right and to me that's not really long enough to be able to I mean you can help someone else but as far as like letting them live with you and stuff like you know what I mean I don't. I mean I i'm glad and i'm thankful that he let her come, but hopefully she does have the right intentions, you know."
323.0,Provider,yeah.
6756.0,Patient,"All I can do is continue to pray for her I. can't make her do something, and you know. Just hope she didn't label it. yeah yeah. he's born too late, because he's only sibling I have left and. He doesn't think about it like that either never think about like what what would happen like your daughter, like you, don't think you would hurt about that."
323.0,Provider,Right oh.
6756.0,Patient,I don't.
323.0,Provider,know not thinking period.
6756.0,Patient,yeah she's just not banking. So hopefully we can get clean enough where we can at least get some sober thought. and start date about.
323.0,Provider,Exactly yeah it's hard to watch.
6756.0,Patient,"It is very hard, especially when you've already you know watch your family members die and stuff it just becomes automatic like. If I get a phone call in the middle of the night or anything I automatically just think the worst like I think is her overdose or dead. just bad."
323.0,Provider,"yeah yeah I know you said, like your kids feel it too."
6756.0,Patient,"yeah they do, they always ask her all the time Mike are you going to get clean, are you going to get clean. But they literally just stop here some. Guy was outside waiting honors him in here that i'm going to get sober i'll be back in a week I said a week. that's not long enough, I said and then what are you gonna do when you come back like go back over there, where he was because that makes no sense, he was like. I was helping you to live, I live here, I said Rachel like we don't have a problem with you live in here that's not it like I my doors always open to her, but she knows he can't come here like on drugs, he goes. I mean that's the only that's the only really restricted in there is for her to be able to come here and if you can do that, then you don't need to come here, because I have kids to worry about I can't be putting them in danger because Earth."
323.0,Provider,"Well, you don't need to be around it and they don't need to be around it."
6756.0,Patient,"Right that's what I told her I said we get we have schedules we get up, we got to work and go to school, like you, and if you did live here you are have to get a job, like you'd have. A treatment, I already told her I said you definitely have to be in treatment, so I thought, are we can talk about it, though call me when you. get a week, on her about and we'll go from there. So we'll see in this next week. This it doesn't make it like. it's very like it just feels like there's like break and all my past and i'm just like waiting for the other one."
323.0,Provider,"Well, because you, you know she's on a roller coaster but you're writing it along with her."
6756.0,Patient,"yeah and I kinda I mean, I have no choice, really, because I feel like if I just let her like everybody's like so are tough love tough love and I said. I mean that works, to a certain extent, but all i've ever seen is that getting people dead, like I don't think that's the correct way to go, like I. I just I feel like I mean I know that's all I have left, but I feel like if I set up my boundaries and set up my rules and keep them like that then we'll be okay."
323.0,Provider,I mean you're going to. have tough love now you're setting up both can't be there.
6756.0,Patient,"Right, I mean i've tried to like totally like ghosts are not cocked or and I just can't do that. on me. Now. But it does make it hard really does."
323.0,Provider,Well we'll keep praying and hoping for the best.
6756.0,Patient,yeah that's all we can do I.
323.0,Provider,"don't know we got to keep planting the seeds, we never know when they're going to. take shape so."
6756.0,Patient,that's true I won't give up.
323.0,Provider,"Right right. All right, ma'am well keep doing the good you're doing."
6756.0,Patient,I will see you tomorrow and.
323.0,Provider,i'll See you in grey take care.
