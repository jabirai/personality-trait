12446.0,Patient,about six months.
235.0,Provider,"So stinking six months. yeah how have you had any lapses or anything, are you doing good to."
12446.0,Patient,"know that says i'm i've been clean clean for three and a half years, and then I had one left, right after my two year old was born um and then I got I started going to a place near my house. But they made me do four meetings, a week and then see my therapist and everything and with my baby having CS then he was in an apple hospital all the time, so I just I was there for a little under a year and then. He got put in the icu again and I dropped out because I need to be there for my baby that's why this works so much better now. I. only had one that now trying to get clean it took me about a year on and off of getting clean."
235.0,Provider,She feel more comfortable in your skin and everything just dealing with life now and just kind of look at the past and say i'm not going back there it's not worth it.
12446.0,Patient,"yeah there's that format. And that's why me and my youngest and dad are having problems is because he does proofs and i've tried and tried to get them clean they kill. Like all right i'm done and then who won't do them for three four days, and then it goes right back to them and then it's just an ongoing thing, and he refuses to get Fo because you don't want to admit he has a problem. A."
235.0,Provider,"lot of guys they know hey I can do it on my own, but you know it's that type of. machismo and it's tough and until they're ready to and you need to have healthy boundaries, I mean I hate to see you know that would cause you to slide or anything so keep that really into consideration because. coming in high end stuff you don't need to be around there."
12446.0,Patient,"Yes, and I guess I go back and forth like when I have my kids will go over there, so the kids still see him because my two oldest key race i've been with him since right. Young like my youngest added them to was six months old and she's been there. You know, every video or every video game every school event every basketball game every you know sick day everything he's been there for them to boys. So now, my dear father has never been there for has it five years never went to a school event never called him on a holiday number bottom yes. never came around and then he found out that Dave and I were having problems and I was saying, with my mother. And he just decided he wants to be a dad now, which is not he's acting like he wants to be a dad but he called Dave. Two days after I left Dave and toby that now that were split up i'm free game and he'll do anything to get me back so his way of getting me back is holding my kids for me I didn't see my kids for almost a month. Because he wouldn't let him I said he wouldn't let me talk to him, he wouldn't let me Sam so that's why we're in court, I mean I have full custody of them to i've had it since 2008. But now he's playing on the schemes and. that's why they there they did a care navigator but he still is at home with his that they live in a two bedroom house there's for adults that live there, trust my two boys plus people that have to put a muzzle on me. And he hasn't worked many thousands of dollars behind on child support his dad takes care of him, and now he thinks that he can take care of our kids so. He got them enrolled in the school in his school district, but called me and told me I need to go buy other school supplies. I need to buy the clothes, I need to do this i'm like so we you want to be Daddy and you want to take care or you want them in your possession now. But you still want me to financially take care of that and because you don't have to drive you don't work in your dad's the only person in that house that works and takes care of all you guys so i'm like it's not happening like. 45 year old he broke his leg last summer and sky some so his six month visit from having this cast is coming up, so I texted Eric and I told him I said Lucas has an appointment. And the 21st for his six months visit for his leg, and he said okay well, you could take him I don't know who it was doctors, I like that right there shows like you should not have possession of my kids."
235.0,Provider,"yeah well i'm glad that you're getting that you know that's going to be, you have a custody navigator and you'll get things sorted out by by January 30 and I think once all the evidence gets up there, that your rock solid and you won't have to deal with that. i'm going to set us up for an appointment and two weeks all right. Let me go ahead and get the pull up the appointment deal here find out what's a good does this time work well for you."
12446.0,Patient,Yes.
235.0,Provider,"Okay, good okay let's get appointments and."

Okay anything else on your mind that you want to talk about that you want to go over. They could think of right now."
12446.0,Patient,that's about it that's everything going on this way.
235.0,Provider,"All right, yeah. Well, thank you for for sharing and. And I look forward to seeing you in a couple weeks them Mercedes okay."
