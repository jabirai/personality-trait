It is, I don't know I just don't like the way. That sometimes she gets treated and then. You know. it's all started when when. When she complained about that guy asking her if she was male or female right. And now, just like I mean he was a kind of a Dick about it, and she says, are you kidding me. I remember that that was."
252.0,Provider,Like we gotta go What do you mean.
2110.0,Patient,"yeah yeah, but it seems like every sense that you know, and she stood up for you know, like she didn't like to be treated that and that guy was kind of he was kind of a deuce to her all the time, and so we just he was no longer allowed to talk to her. And anyways but It just seems like stood up herself one time and now she gets she's been in the yellow right four times since then. Or at least three times that she got put on four day restriction."
252.0,Provider,Did she miss any. Did she miss any.
2110.0,Patient,"um. They would get. Like go. Thinking it was next week and go to the next week and miss it by a week, but you know show up the group Oh, I thought it was today not last week and. This typical things you know we write shoot on the calendar now to help to do that, you know. yeah but nothing like. Nothing no warrants. over three years of recovery. A reprimand like that I."
252.0,Provider,"understand it don't get it. yeah well what they think is. This is this is kind of what they've added this care intensity Program. The system and what it is, is it just monitors cancellations, a model monitors no shows. it's not. meant to be read them a REP from. A reprimanding it's not meant to be a punishment, but."
2110.0,Patient,If you if.
252.0,Provider,"You know, all of a sudden, you know appointments are being Mr groups be missed. they're like oh. red flag is she okay so come see us for a couple weeks so consistency. You know, coming let's get you back on track. and make sure you're okay. that's all that is supposed to be for has been a pain in the butt since it's been implemented. A lot of people that the minute that they put it in the system, a lot of people that were monthly or quarterly. got switched to. It was like an automatic switch to weekly. And so we're having as providers to go through each person. and say you know no. This one's consistent shows up. You know it's and we've had to go in and change it so. Maybe. If she's missed a couple groups I don't know i'm not Dr growth. But. Maybe if she's missed. Groups and accidentally. Wrong time wrong week you know. Once she's there. Dr groves and push it back to exactly the way it. Was that's what i'm thinking. But I don't know that's what I would do is I work with now we do. So."
2110.0,Patient,"guys got memory problems to others. I do to stop. Just seems like it's more than not with her. You know and plus you know they put this into place when the person calls and says hey I missed. I knew make it up and when they do make it up, you know, like there's got to be a human element in this program told her right yeah there's there's a lot of individuals out there that per. We. Do this kind of thing, but when a person's people in the struggles that they're going through."
