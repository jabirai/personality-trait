298.0,Provider,yeah that is wonderful um what was the situation that got you into the hospital.
15010.0,Patient,"um I have this i'm like discovering now it's kind of funny because I keep saying like I had like a great time at beach sleep just because it's like the first time I really seek help for myself. When I was like kind of involuntary but you know what i'm yeah I just i'm definitely learned, now that I struggle with my correct coping skills. So definitely kind of turned back to old habits of like drinking too much using cocaine. And so I became very overwhelmed with some stuff going on at home and like with my business and everything like that, and I was not consistently taking my medication i'm on wellbutrin. So it just kind of spirals I feel a little quickly and yeah just felt very overwhelmed and made a really stupid decision."
298.0,Provider,Okay. And how many days were you there did you see.
15010.0,Patient,Saturday to Saturday so from the third to the a lot.
298.0,Provider,Okay.
15010.0,Patient,Oh i'm sorry I was in the hospital on the third so I got there on the floor today.
298.0,Provider,"What do you kind of work, do you do from home."
15010.0,Patient,i'm a personal trainer.
298.0,Provider,and Oh wow okay sorry just got cut something caught my eye i'm. Let me think. So you're on wellbutrin what is the amount.
15010.0,Patient,"So what they gave me is 100 so it's a generic well future but it's 100 milligrams twice a day and then actually I can double check, but I was taking before that, because I wasn't sure what I actually just my mom brought up last. and Okay, so what my doctor was prescribing me before that was 150 milligrams twice a day as well, so they brought it down a little bit."
298.0,Provider,Okay. um were you having any hallucinations or delusions.
15010.0,Patient,Okay.
298.0,Provider,um. What are your stressors in life.
15010.0,Patient,"um again, I think I just like I struggle with communication really so if I need help, I don't feel comfortable really asking for it. And then I like as a trainer I take care of people all day long even unlike taking them suffer through working out. So I feel i'm more used to attempting to give more of myself, but when I need help, I don't know how to ask for it, or like kind of really open up, I feel like I guess it's like a burden or I don't know i'm just like not normally comfortable in that position so yeah."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, what are your strengths, what do you like about yourself."
15010.0,Patient,"um to cover that a little bit more, but I do like that I an empathetic and very open to like anyone story I don't feel like i'm judgmental. yeah."
298.0,Provider,"Well, in that way we're kindred spirits. How would you describe your moves."
15010.0,Patient,"Moves um something we're talking about this in a minute um I would say. I was always kind of I don't want to say, like an unknown state, because that sounds kind of bad, but I would, I would just say consistent, but I am very sensitive to where. Like the smallest things can make me happy, yet the smallest things can also make me overthink or become really sad so. yeah I don't know if I answered the question."
298.0,Provider,How is your ability to focus.
15010.0,Patient,"it's I mean it's pretty good, I would say again my my job is like super fun and I just get to hang out with people and watch them move so. kind of what I do all day, but I will say like at the end of the night if i'm like watching TV or something I typically want to be doing laundry or something with it or i'll so well kind of cut around, but I think that's when I started to feel like a little anxious or something yeah."
298.0,Provider,Have you ever attempted suicide.
15010.0,Patient,know the first time.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, you didn't attempt to had suicidal thoughts."
15010.0,Patient,Yes or did you attempt at a time.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, how did you attempt."
15010.0,Patient,"I took 10 norco is or what was said was narcos I don't think it actually was that um but whatever that's what I picked up and then. I had like a little bit of awesome with it like maybe two shots was like a when they picked me up there, like do you want to take this with you because they thought it was closed like so that's how much I hadn't have that much, and then I did self harm on my wrist."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, and who ended up taking you."
15010.0,Patient,"I was taking it in an ambulance but my roommate kind of figured out where I was going on, so he was the one that calls and have me they essentially okay."
298.0,Provider,what's your height and weight.
15010.0,Patient,i'm five five and like on average i'm like 106 maybe one second I kind of cover depending i've had a lot of pizza last night so probably one time.
298.0,Provider,What is your living situation.
15010.0,Patient,"So it's just me and my roommate and R dot well his dog that I consider her my dog now as well we both work out of the House, he does branding I work out of the garage or i'll go to some plants houses, but yeah so we're dispensing."
298.0,Provider,Okay. um. Any substance abuse history like. The alcohol yeah.
15010.0,Patient,"I would say that I was definitely drinking too much, and then I was using pain for a long time as well, and then I went insane like. I use it in a very large amount, but occasionally I will smoke some weed if i'm trying to fall asleep. Or if i'm going to get really anxious and have like nothing else to do for the rest of the day, but that's very, very rare but used to be on ambien and my doctor. was like you have a very addictive personality let's not have you continue using that maybe try some medical marijuana and see if that helps and so that's why I started."
298.0,Provider,Okay. All right. um. What is your sexuality.
15010.0,Patient,Like.
298.0,Provider,No more like do you like girls boys.
15010.0,Patient,"When I was single and kind of like being a hoe I would kind of do whatever, but I. Know i'm like."
298.0,Provider,Okay. And are you in a relationship right now. know what was getting you down.
15010.0,Patient,"um well there is, I mean there's a lot of things like my family and I were we weren't really talking for this past basically here. And so my greatest support system is my roommate essentially and I do have some friends, but like my best friends going through. I would say 1000 times worse things and this not suicidal but like for moms in the icu was appropriate and whatnot so I just kind of felt like I didn't really have. The closest people I had to turn to you because I either was like she's going through so much I don't want to put on her and my roommate and I are we almost up so we were just kind of discussing you know. And I mean yeah so it just I think it was really stressful because I was afraid to lose my business and like I didn't really know where to turn so."
298.0,Provider,yeah yeah. I.
15010.0,Patient,"I think a lot of it, too, to be honest, was I wasn't consistently taking my hope uterine for like a month, because I, I was trying to take it before or after I ate my first meal, but sometimes that's not until later. And then, sometimes I fall asleep before I take a second so, so I think that was."
298.0,Provider,How are you feeling now.
15010.0,Patient,"i'm feeling good I mean I. You know it's it's it's a lot of adjusting coming back into the world after being in there. Then they coming to her shoes and abroad, again, but. The overall i'm i'm good I just mean I feel bad for putting the people around me through this, and this, you know sort of tried to see called a long time ago and I still kind of silly for not doing that, but I guess now better than never."
298.0,Provider,"All right, well, you are good to go. you've met your requirement you've been very transparent, I appreciate that. Do you have any questions for me."
15010.0,Patient,"No i'm I mean I know i'm going away for a month and, like it's a. Real it's no fun no or no fun sorry no phone. Hopefully, some fun. And I would assume that they were probably helped me set up like the aftercare whatever, but if not I could contact."
298.0,Provider,"combat it absolutely you guys. can come back to us for after care, if you so choose."
15010.0,Patient,Okay perfect yeah.
298.0,Provider,"All right, take care."
15010.0,Patient,"All right, thank you so much, have a good day."
298.0,Provider,All right to suicide level risk is moderate to high just because of a recent. attempt.
