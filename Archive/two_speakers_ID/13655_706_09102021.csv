706.0,Provider,So today we're going to do your bps your bio psychosocial. i'm just a bunch of questions kind of out just passed staff um tell me about what brings you to bright heart.
13655.0,Patient,"Oh cool though i'll try to keep it as small as possible, my husband passed away last fall, he was sick for three years um he was basically dying and stuff but anyway, he he wanted to die every day tried to kill himself, I mean i've been through a lot in the last three years. And January 2020 I had a friend passed away a week later, my mother passed away and then my husband tried to kill himself twice after that. exactly a week later, and then another week later. I was holding it together as best I could so i've been running everything myself, since he passed September last September I got overwhelmed because I had to start all over again, he was had I high end. Everything and I had to try to budget so i've been working for months and months and months, and I have Ms and chrome's and I had to start over on my medical with doctors and everything in July. I had a break and anxiety break that i'd never had before I couldn't think straight, but I was busy five days a week, try and i'm juggling so much. X actually I come to deal with what happened with my husband, but anytime anything drops on me I lose it I just the anxiety just boils up and it used to be, I get anxiety and I can control it, you know and now it's I haven't had an episode for probably two and a half weeks now. I get a little anxiety, but it was so debilitating there's almost like a panic thing i've heard my friends had them before and I never did, and I just. I it was it was different, and I can handle my Ms and my crohn's and my diseases, but this and I got sick on top of it, I was getting at an infection. In my system, and I think that pushed me over the edge that I would like to be able to deal with, I have things I can deal with anxiety with, but I would like to find different options of how to. You know, like say i'm having a hard time sleeping because will come in the middle of the night, mostly now I am busy all the time, I mean I have doctors appointments I mean they'll get sticky notes everywhere, but I have been really overwhelmed let's put it that way and. We can't change the past, I know that."
706.0,Provider,I can.
13655.0,Patient,deal with it and. Like I said i've been doing well with that and I figured time would heal. yeah but. I always helped me.
706.0,Provider,If you're constantly looking backwards you're gonna run into a wall.
13655.0,Patient,i'm trying not to.
706.0,Provider,yeah we can't keep looking back word.
13655.0,Patient,"Now, everything is so chaotic and busy and harder to take care of now than it was years ago it's constant do to do hop hop hop and my health doesn't, allow me to do that 24 seven anymore, because I was high I was like energy before. And i'm really. In the last few years i've just I mean I have chronic fatigue syndrome so it's it that's part it's everything just don't talk compounded."
706.0,Provider,So yeah definitely so um So do you have any history like substance use it all.
13655.0,Patient,"Just for my Ms for the last 21 years and microphones and stuff like that i've been on and off and stuff I don't tolerate medicines very well. Okay um i've been on a lot over the years i've taken myself off, I mean once like, for my disease and for pain medicine, I have to be able to function, I can't be my mind can't be altered in any way that's just the way I am I was in the military, so I i'm i'm pretty organized. And now it's just seems like everything's disorganized and stuff but as far as medicines go i've cut myself back over 21 years and they kept giving me more and I could take them and I don't know. So i'm on. Two medications right so. I don't drink or anything like that."
706.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, so you really don't have a substance use problem you just have been you have been on substances in the past."
13655.0,Patient,"right for my for my doctors three doctors, through my doctors and like I said they kept in touch and I let everybody know what i'm taking and what i'm off of you know. i've done that, with you guys so far this time too, because i've been having a lot of doctors appointments procedures and Madison out me and I actually gave me some and I wasn't gonna take it because I couldn't it, it does I don't tolerate it well, so at all."
706.0,Provider,"yeah see me, you have like a reaction to it."
13655.0,Patient,"yeah it's the older, I get the worst against i'm allergic to a lot of medication anyway, but. i've never taken any substances, before I got sick or anything like that. So I you know. i'm allergic to a lot of things and I find out after I take a half I usually only take half a dose of stuff anyway, when they give it to me just to see how it's going to. me so yeah."
706.0,Provider,So. What are your mental health diagnosis.
13655.0,Patient,"Okay, I haven't had one I my doctor, my name is Dr he left in July, which, through me to tailspin because I was left hanging. um. He said that ptsd said I was going to quote through hell two and a half years ago with my husband, but I was trying to stay strong and everything my husband. I started, he was in a dark place I started going there but i'm my spiritual beliefs would not let me go there. But I have ptsd from that and then I know that, with everything i've had to do in the last year did it just compounded I mean this stuff I I don't have anybody to help me. With any of this, so it just overwhelmed me um and like I said i've had i've always been kind of. High strung a little bit, but I can always control it with meditation and all that i'm just there, I was a very high active person active. just get things done, making sure it was done taken care of and and stuff so anyway, but ptsd was one, and I know that I had to panic attacks. And I, and this is anxiety that I have, and it could be part of my Ms too, because my body gets to feeling like that, sometimes, so my legs and my arms that this was coming down visceral all the way up, and it would just paralyze me so. That i've been pretty good, the last two and a half weeks. Because I know what happened i'm doing everything I possibly can to fix this."
706.0,Provider,uh huh.
13655.0,Patient,"And it, the reason I got Ahold of you, because I had a breakdown when I went to the hospital something was wrong, I put my glasses down my phone I couldn't remember seconds later. But I was juggling everyday stuff and I got sick on top of it, I know what happened and like I said, but I still need to deal with this one bad stuff goes and it's me and overwhelms me I need to know how to. How can I put it can sometimes I have i'm on through to three calls, at a time and I can't talk to three people at a time. So, then, the anxiety comes up, because these are things that has to be taken care of. I prioritize as well, but when I got three or four priorities that wants to do at the same time it's it's overwhelming I can help them. And like I say I take a breath and it'll get to it, the next day, something else and usually i've had to cut people off the phone and I get stressed real easy, now more than I ever used to uh huh so and like I said I I just I didn't want to take any more pills or anything like that."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm. So okay so um let's talk about the mental health so looking at your file it looks like you have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder which makes sense ptsd and then major depressive disorder.
13655.0,Patient,"depressed i'm really not depressed I get sad once a while blue. i've never been into depression, you know. I I did state when I went to the hospital, I will not kill myself my spiritual will not let me do that i've always had a little light burning and the thing is my husband tried to so much that I know how much it hurts and I there's no way that I would do that. Okay okay."
706.0,Provider,"that's fair so um. in regards to. Your mental health, what kind of treatments, have you had do you take any medication for your mental health at this time."
13655.0,Patient,"um well I started xanax four years ago, for it was. Or, I was on selection 20 years ago and, anyway, I got off of that it was just a low dose, even though I didn't have any problems than it is figured with the insurance and me being ill with illness, I have. I took that I quit that 2016 I was doing pretty good, no, no, I didn't have any problems i'm xanax my doctor just filled. With us give me three a day my other doctor will I down to one a day at night. And then i'm on oxy code on i'm picking that for my pain management and a half, every three four hours of the low dose so i've been on that before it's, the only thing that's been working for me for four years, because i've been offered so many. Drugs over the years I just didn't didn't couldn't tolerate it so."
706.0,Provider,um so Have you had suicidal ideations thoughts.
13655.0,Patient,"of no, no, no, I wish God would take me sometimes you know, give me some some peace but not physically taking my life and all the medicine that I have here, I could have done that a long time ago and I it's just something where where my mind will not allow me to go. i'm a different breed kind of a very spiritual um and that's what's gotten me through a lot of this too. And like I said I had a good childhood and and everything my dad was a minister i'm. You know i'm pretty i'm pretty stable that way, but like I said that's why it scared me when this happened it's not like I was going to do something. To myself I just I couldn't think straight I couldn't you know I couldn't function and it wasn't, it was because of the anxiety, so I can see i'm just looking to learn how to deal with that."
706.0,Provider,Okay um so now real like suicidal ideations like you want to hurt yourself or kill yourself but thoughts of you know if God took me out that wouldn't be too bad.
13655.0,Patient,"Well, it would be a lot lot easier, I want to live, and I want to get on with my life that's my goal, I want to get on a routine and I want to get on my start enjoying my life again."

They got yelled at me for getting a vaccine and he wouldn't didn't want me to me after my husband passed, he was yelling at me all the time he called me up drunk and I love my son, he was never this way up until probably seven years ago. And my heart is broken over that i'm gonna start crying in a minute. And i've never told them how to run his life, but what I do for me they tried to run my life so basically I talked to him on the phone he loves me, I know that and we we talk, but I just I have to keep this out out of my life because I lived with it with my husband and I can't. And I want everybody to be okay and. Nobody who would listen and I couldn't get him to do anything I can't even talk about my health problems he told me a few weeks ago, he has no emotions and that was not my son. And before he was that way now. i'm like I love my son dearly I was really proud of him, but he's he's changed and, like everybody in this country is changing and. I guess they i'm doing the best I can i'm actually come to grips you know resolve to this and i'm learning how to handle it when I speak with them basically talk about whether fires, you know that he didn't want to hear about my health or anything like that. And stuff so you know I don't talk about that I try to keep everything up be that trying to keep him out of all this stuff that was going on before. Because he's my son and I try to protect them, protect them and stuff. i'm too soft I need to get tough and up a little bit and it's hard for me to say no, you know it really is but nobody's gonna change my principles I have my principles are where they're at, and I will not determine from those.
