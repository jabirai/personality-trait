235.0,Provider,"Okay. Why don't we start off with that one I like that was given to this one keep a daily journal, but I think we can kind of do that with this other one. yeah so what we'll do is we'll put our goal down as identifying thoughts feelings that trigger anger okay that's that's our our. Specific. Okay, so ID. thoughts. Was the other thing."
17194.0,Patient,That trigger anger.
235.0,Provider,"thoughts feelings that triggering thoughts and feelings at triggering anger. feelings that triggers anger. And then okay so that's our specific now. What we're going to do as far as measurable. It says here thoroughly assess the various stimuli situations people thoughts that have triggered your anger and thoughts feelings and actions that have characterized his or her responses, so I think the measurable way to do that would be maybe journaling. Okay 1010 minutes a day you think you can do that."
17194.0,Patient,"yeah i've been meaning to it like to do that it's you know just like what the meetings has been like in the back of my head, but yeah I think journaling would be good."
235.0,Provider,"Okay, so we're going to start journaling. and identifying. triggers are generally and identify. triggers. Okay. chevelle. Do you think these cold, I need to be do you believe that these goals, this goal is attainable that you could be able to do this. Yes, okay. So you agree with that. Theresa feels. The school is very attainable. Very attainable I gotta go back to the other one first and put down what the measuring thing we're going to do their attainable so we're going to start journaling and it triggers on measuring so devoting. 10 minutes a day, can you do that."
17194.0,Patient,yeah that's perfect.
235.0,Provider,"Okay let's do that, and then you know if you want to break it up a couple minutes in the morning five minutes, and after whatever you know. Things that kind of maybe have a little notepad or write some things down and then, if some you know you get inspiration, or whatever just keep writing and then we could go over that stuff in a couple weeks."
17194.0,Patient,"All right, or I was kind of thinking even also just. As it goes on throughout the day like the triggers you know if I have the time to like kind of you know, pull up you know, to the side and i'm thinking you know put a little note in my phone and then at the end of the day, I can sit there and right. Now, or whatever."
235.0,Provider,"I love that kind of that's a good way kind of like stepping back and taking a breath is stepping back and taking a note. And then you know. You and I think that's kind of that whole thing about thought actions feelings which is really good because it makes you really think you know and not react well developed be devoting 10 minutes a day. To start. To begin with. Okay, and then realistic realistic being it's not too easy, but you feel capable and achieving the goal."
17194.0,Patient,mm hmm.
235.0,Provider,"yeah I think it's yeah which feels that it's very reasonable. very reasonable and. we'll review. In a few weeks. A few weeks. And I think timetable wise that's like timeframes set a time frame for the goal either next week, one month three months, six months one year, whatever. I think, as you get to just like two weeks that maybe we should set it for a month and we'll see how you're progressing when we talk again in a couple of weeks."
