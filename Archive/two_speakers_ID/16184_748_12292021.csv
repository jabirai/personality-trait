748.0,Provider,hi. been missing you and sessions.
16184.0,Patient,Sorry. Just the audio okay.
748.0,Provider,yeah I can hear you I missing seeing you in sessions.
16184.0,Patient,i've had a really hard couple of weeks.
748.0,Provider,I hadn't.
16184.0,Patient,"I have a hard time around the holidays anyway, but I like days that are missing from the past couple of weeks, and I think i'm having some pretty major side effects to medication right now. it's hard to get up without feeling really busy like i'm going to pass out i'm like throat a mouth or super dry."
748.0,Provider,so good at all.
16184.0,Patient,"Now those kind of rotten. I can continue taking my medication, but I think until I can get into see tanya again because I missed my appointment with her on Monday and I missed group yesterday. There was a bunch of stuff around Christmas was difficult but. The thing my father's mad at me."
748.0,Provider,Why is your father man.
16184.0,Patient,"I have my older son text message him before Christmas, because we usually go there every Christmas. And last year, this past year we didn't go because my stepmother had to have surgery for breast cancer. And I didn't really know how to talk to my dad or like let anybody know that I was in trouble, whether I was having a hard time and I didn't want to bring that to him because mental health issues kind of ruin my relationship with him when I was in my teens. But I have my older son aiden send him a text message letting him know that i've been sick, because I was, I was in the icu and may, and then I just. kind of been in prison or my own body in my own head, since the summertime but. My my dad wrote back to him and said something about if my daughter doesn't want to talk to me that's fine we've been down this road, before. Apparently, my my husband. spoke with him, but I didn't know that when I was in the hospital and my father was talking to him about my house and the insurance claim that we had because the whole downstairs flooded. And my dad was just fixated on the insurance thing and I guess my husband. told him kind of told him off a little bit because he was like, why do you care so much about the House I just told you that your daughter's in the hospital and I I told my husband when I spoke to him that. that's just kind of how my dad is he is why I didn't contact him for this whole past year I figured. I didn't want to bring any unnecessary drama or stress to his life because my step mom hundred go through the stuff that she went through and I didn't really know how to talk to him about that or how to broach that subject because I don't do well with like. death or change or anything like that. And so it sounds like he's kind of mad at me but I can't really address that until i'm stable. Because right now, and someone came to the door, this morning I guess it was someone selling solar stuff and I panicked so bad just hearing my doorbell. And so I had to go to my son's room and ask him a few go down and see what was up, and it was just someone trying to solicit, even though I have a no soliciting sign on my door but. that's how I kind of knew that. The medication. Baby okay go play. and that's how I kind of knew that a lot of my anxiety problems are still it's really bad. Surely. And I know it's depression, too, I know that things ideas kind of feeding the depression, because I just keep wondering like. Like at Christmas time we didn't even have a have a big dinner we didn't open up a lot of presence I just promote my younger son's presence out and gave them to him. And I always did Christmas is really big, but my husband's in New York, seeing his family and I wasn't going to my dad's house. Not that I want to leave my house at all anyway, because the on the chron stuff which is like another layer of. But I really feel like i'm. telling you tried me on seroquel and at first, I thought it was helping so she increase the dosage and. increase the dosage of my antidepressant and I don't know what it is, but antidepressants but I always obsess over death like really obsess over it. Sure, I can't. sleep at night, what."
748.0,Provider,When you're taking antidepressants you obsessed.
16184.0,Patient,"yeah i'm. ssri isn't Snr eyes okay um. and I will I kind of went on YouTube trying to find out like what medications are out there for depression, to see if maybe some of those I can actually tolerate or which ones i've because i've been on an. antidepressant antidepressants since I was 14 So my first was Prozac. um. But a lot of the side effects that i'm having excessive sweating the dizziness that. it's it was my throat was so dry this morning that I was having a hard time swallowing. and I she prescribed me ambien extended release for sleep, because I just I was, I went like three days without sleeping and that was on the regular ambien. And I tried the extended release. And I ended up doing a whole bunch of stuff that I don't remember and hurt anybody I wasn't harmful, but I keep my kids away. And I guess I went downstairs at some point, and then I tried to I was like going to your I guess motions I had I don't have any bleach powder, but I have developer cream and apparently I put the developer cream in my hair. And I pulled out some hair dye and. I have like I had episodes where I completely dissociate. So that's not abnormal like there's a lot of times, where I do lose track of chunks of time, but I kind of am I, my son tells me that he can he can sense when i'm like I am now or when i'm not going to remember it. And he said there's a discernible shift in the way they speak, the way that I. And that's. So I don't mind the sleepwalking thing, as long as i'm not doing something harmful like trying to drive which I can't do anyway. But I don't know. If I have. I don't know if it's tied to seizures at all, because I started having seizures about three years ago, I never had them in my life. And I had gone a couple of months without having a seizure, but in the past two weeks i've had three. And that's a lot, like the sleepwalking is, for me, are the dissociative episodes I just don't remember anything. So it's. Getting really frustrated with myself because i'm."
748.0,Provider,not your fault.
16184.0,Patient,"I just feel like i'm letting my kids down, and I know. I finally can come clean with my husband and I told him look i'm really i'm in trouble right now i'm not gonna do anything to hurt anybody, I never i've never had any any issues with hurting people in my life it's always like self stuff. and it's hard because. We don't have a lot of money, right now, and I I don't know. I don't know how to be not married because I was married for 20 years. And so I don't know how to work all of that out i'm trying to be as amicable as possible so that my son's is okay and um. Because I don't just because you're not a great spouse doesn't mean you're not a good parent. And I do I do know that he loves my son our son a lot um. But I also know, he can be vindictive and petty when he wants to be. And there's a lot of stuff on on the table, right now, with my younger son because he's on an IP and I kind of put off signing it because I wanted to look over it during break. And what i've seen so far as they want to put them on like a modified schedule he's been in full day school, since he was in preschool. And because he he has autism, and so they let him start with a preschool and he's always had a one to one aid and he's gone to school. But the school that is out right now it's talking about putting him on a certificate pathway, which basically means that they do away with all your. academic studies and instead they focus on life skills and I can do life skills with them here at home, I don't want to just consign him to. To a box like I don't want him to be limited. And both of my sons have been in special education my older son tried to go to college, but he failed out of out of college it just doesn't fit him and then i'm. Like my older son has a learning disability and I suspect that my younger son might too. But um. it's hard, because I know the laws have gone to all the workshops and everything. But it really feels like schools, nowadays, even though my son goes to a charter school, which is a lot better than public school um. I kind of feel like. They just pass the buck like they just pass them on when I was a kid you could fail and they held you back and I fought for retention for my younger son and. I have so much on my mind I don't even know where to start um so."
748.0,Provider,"I was just noticing that I was noticing how. You know where you really started with it was with how much pain your mood. And then you. worry so quickly that that's impacting their children, which of course is our reality and it's important. And and tight here that you have reached out to your husband their father. And that he can get involved in supporting them in the focus needs to be on getting well."
16184.0,Patient,"No problem is that I just I know it takes a while for any medication to take hold but. A few years ago. it's why I ended up on long term benzodiazepines because nothing else for our trial and medications medication at therapeutic levels for six weeks eight weeks and either I would have really awful side effects like i'm having right now, or it just wasn't effective, and I know that there's. A call treatment resistant depression it kind of like my body, I was on 11 milligrams of xanax a day was taking it pretty much all day long to keep me regulated and also help with my seizures but. It was only because I been on a whole bunch of other stuff and boost from which is specifically for anxiety and the feeling I get high blood pressure. In my chest, I have really bad palpitations and it really feels like you're going to die like when when your heart kind of stops and then skips up a couple of beats. So I, I have a lot of physiological issues that the nouns have mental health issues, too, so it's it's difficult because I feel like. The older i'm getting the worst i'm getting and it shouldn't be like that it should be the officer, like the older you get the more you should kind of know. And I guess it's that."
748.0,Provider,Where did you get that role.
16184.0,Patient,"I don't know. You really. Well, I think a lot of."
748.0,Provider,"passion, where is the compassion that you have for everyone else in at least in the nation, if not on the planet who experiences autism. That you've advocated for thought for worked for where's the compassion that you have, for your children, whereas the compassion, you have, for your husband to. You know we all deserve it, however comma, and you know what about giving some attack Convention."
16184.0,Patient,"i've never actually sat back. Maybe it's a coping mechanism sure probably is and some dysfunctional way. But i've always been really good at helping other people that's why I went to college for psychology. And i've always been really good at helping other people and that's actually where I get my sense of well being from is it is being useful and helping other people I love to volunteer and I love to do things um. I guess it's because I grew up with my whole first I was abused really badly in my mother's house and then, when I was taken away and. I met my dad when I was nine and he took custody of me, but then I ended up getting kicked out of his house, when I was 14 because I had a lot of mental health issues I would run away from home, I was self mutilating I was using drugs. And I never used drugs, because I liked them like I never used alcohol, because I liked alcohol I just. there's an edge to me that is so sharp that I can't touch. and A lot of I worry a lot about being too much for people or. or when it's okay to ask for help and when it's kind of borderline narcissism, and so I think sometimes I just err on the side of caution and I just suck everything up. But like."
748.0,Provider,You you you i'm glad i've known you for a while you gel get to even contemplate. That you are asking for help is not okay. You.
16184.0,Patient,"I think, where it comes from, like this, like my dad's reaction yeah when when my son told them that I was dealing with medical issues, because I didn't want to bring up mental health issues, because. there's just such a stigma when it comes down on he hates my mother hates or hates rates are and my mother's very dysfunctional and very manipulative and very toxic. And I haven't spoken to her in a few years but i'm. Even all these years later he hates her and I always felt like there was some echo of her in me that my father saw and he just didn't like it, so I always try to be perfect or got straight a's in school like. Even when I went back to college, I had a 4.0 GPA, because I would just stay up for days, if I had a three page paper to write I write a nine page paper think I wrote my last paper and. philosophy and it was on trick. But. I think I. it's not maybe maybe i'm somewhere where I don't think i'm worth it, or maybe I just tend to minimize my problems because i'm. Like I have chronic pain issues, because I have arthritis and all my lower vertebrae the degenerative disc disease, they kind of just grind together, so I get a lot of pain and. I never really talked about it, I just kind of stomach it muscle through it. And I and a lot of people have kind of wonder. If I if my pain level is actually where i'm supposed to be, because i'll be at like a nine or an eight but all recorded as like a two or three because. I have very hard time knowing when it's appropriate and one that's I know that it's not inappropriate task for help. But I don't want to burden other people with my baggage when there's you know, because nobody has a corner on suffering."
748.0,Provider,"i'm much more. value. I don't really mean that word but it's the word that fits in the sentence, do you suppose you might offer the world if you actually had some peace. and joy. Freedom from keen in. Internal emotional mental suffering, how much more do you think you might have to offer the world. If you have an."
16184.0,Patient,"incident I. know that there's a whole stereotype with autism that you know we lack empathy and. Some people just don't display empathy but my younger son is a lot my older son is very he has emotional switch where he can kind of turn it off and then he becomes very flat. And that's what I have to ask him if he's okay my younger son, he will talk all day long almost to the point, like you, lately i've been getting very irritated with him and I think it's because of my medication, but because I think your abilities, a side effect. And then he he talks a lot he needs a lot of attention, a lot of reinforcement encouragement. But he also has such a tremendous sense of empathy and like if he missed the school will cry. If he thinks that he's hurt somebody who cry. And he's very anxious as well, so a lot, like me, in that regard, but I see so much of myself and him and I almost see in him what I could have been. had I not been so damaged and so mistreated, when I was younger. Because there's a tipping point where once that innocence is gone it's gone, you can get back. But I I tend to have really if people like I have a hard time in support groups, because I tend to feel other people's pain. and When I used to drive down the street, I would look into other people's cars, and I would just wonder what they were thinking or if they were okay and. I would take homeless people food on thanksgiving. there's so much in me that, like, I feel like I was born with a servant's heart. I don't have to be the Center of attention, I don't have to. Have accolades or or anything like that it's knowing that i've made a difference. Knowing that my. almost like an existential crisis, you know why am I here what's my purpose, where, am I going. i've been thinking about that a lot lately. Because I don't feel like i'm living right now I feel like i'm just existing. yeah and that's no way to live your life and but then once I start thinking about it and i'm like well i'd be better off dead my kids come into the equation. And if it wasn't for my kids I think i'd be dead right now i'm."
748.0,Provider,"i've heard that from you, before. And in the thing that stands out to me so much. Where and. Maybe a better way to say this, how do we get you to prioritize and make your feeling and being as important as much as."
16184.0,Patient,"it's hard because i'm. tanya prescribed me some no problem, but she can be 15 tablets for the whole month and I didn't read the prescription on the bottle so I thought I could take one a day, and so I took all of them, and then I realized like. it's that out of control, anxious feeling there's a there's a really fine line between manageable unmanageable and again go to a manageable really, really quickly escalates very quickly. As usually warnings it feeling another feeding another feeding another and then it just gets the point where i'm so overwhelmed by life that I break down and I just shut down like I have been lately, because if I don't shut down i'm going to completely explode and. I don't feel anchored right now I feel like i'm very disconnected from my body. And again, I don't know how much of that is side effects medication and because I don't tend to do very well on exercise, but my insurance wouldn't cover the medication that kind of wanted to give me. What i'm going."
748.0,Provider,To give you.
16184.0,Patient,"i'm trying to remember what it was called it's not something that I remember ever being on. But i've been on medications like Cinderella which is nice nri but it's pretty much just given for pain almost like goosebumps just give them for anxiety. So i'm. Right now i'm on food boxing mean yes, the blue box mean. And i've gained weight, which is horrible, I am very hard on myself when I gain weight, too, because I just see myself as just being really grotesque. And because i'm still grappling with that whole i'm going to be getting divorced mentality um thankfully my husband right now is acting like he said on the phone said. At first, he was like you know you've got to grow up and he was like it's not even about that it's just about me being able to handle life right now i'm just having a very hard time because one thing after another and. Having a compromised immune system i'm terrified to go out in public, I just gotten, to the point where I was like maybe I could walk out and get my mail and then Omar Khan came. And it's very transmittable and its. People are getting it that have already been vaccinated. And it's it's. Thinking about a world outside that is full of germs and full of toxins. But then, knowing that I have to venture outside, to be able to start functioning. it's so difficult to re enter society when you've been out of it for so long and it's been okay to be out of it because everybody was in quarantine. And I don't want to give up on on some of the medications. But I know it's kind of pointless to take a medication if you're having super bad side effects and then, of course I missed my appointment on Monday. So I couldn't talk to her about it, then, because I was going to ask her if. I could have clonazepam instead of the present lamb, so I think that's called klonopin instead of the xanax because then X is very um. I think the problem with xanax is that it works very quickly and it's very effective for acute panic attacks, but it wears off very quickly that the half life on it is is about two to four hours and because I metabolize things so quickly. it's usually out of my system, you know within an hour to. And when I when I have taken it, it does put it does bring me back to where I can kind of relax because my whole body is just so tense step that I constantly eight. And it lets me relax a little bit and breathe, but. Once it wears off the anxiety comes back and there's like a rebound because i'm used to the feeling I get kind of used to the feeling of not having that acute fight or flight. And then i'm kind of reintroduced to it again so it's um. I know that medications I used to be on Volume I was on volume, for a number of years, and so they put me on xanax and I know that they don't want to prescribe benzodiazepine because it can be addictive."
748.0,Provider,severely. And yeah definitely.
16184.0,Patient,"yeah and I when I pulled myself off of the clone of fit or not, when I pulled myself off of the problem, I was on 11 milligrams a day and i've been taking that on top of. fentanyl patches for my back because I wanted something that wouldn't metabolize so fast and with the with like oxy cotton and stuff I was just popping pills all day and I hated it, so I was on a fentanyl patch and then I was also on i'll pass LM and ambien for sleep and. I pulled myself out of it completely cold Turkey everything. it's kind of hard quit smoking to just one day done and got rid of it, but this time it was harder to get off of it because I did have my seizures were a lot more pronounced. I wouldn't even I have."
748.0,Provider,You got off of it cold Turkey because you can't do that with opiates or benzo.
16184.0,Patient,yeah.
748.0,Provider,very severely yeah.
16184.0,Patient,"For me, it was more. It was more just not wanting to be. Controlled because I already feel like anxiety kind of controls me and I hate it and I pushed back and I felt like. medication was kind of controlling my life like if I didn't take it, I would start to feel sick, whether or not even need the medication. And I didn't like that feeling I didn't like the feeling of oh i'm running out of medication need to talk to the doctor, how do I figure this out, so I don't go without medication get sick, so it was just easier for me to you know it was about two months that I was really sick. And then, after that I. I was drinking. And i'm not a big i'm not a drinker at all, because I always i've always hated alcohol hit tastes I hit home makes you feel the next day just hate it, but it was. It was convenient. Especially when I found out that the liquor store will deliver alcohol straight to your door um it's like having a drug dealer that just comes to your House, so I pulled myself off of alcohol, too, and I ended up going through dts and. But it was because I realized that I was utilizing it for self medication and I just called him the ambulance one day and said, you need to come get me. Because if I don't kill myself this what i'm doing right now is going to kill me and so as admitted to the hospital severe alcohol poisoning and that's when I went to the ranch and I was in the. frozen, a Christian discipleship program for two months, while my older son took care of my younger son. And I. got completely clean of everything and didn't even need my medication, but when I got out of there and came home all of the stressors of home we're back, whereas while I was at the ranch my food was taking care of didn't have to worry about the bills, because the bills weren't mine. And all I really had to worry about was doing my program learning the Bible verses doing Bible study and stuff. So it. If if I could like time travel back to the 1980s, that was probably even though I was really severely abused, back then, it was probably one of the only periods that I felt at peace. me as I always. This is going to come. This is gonna sound really, really weird, but I feel like i'm really sensitive to external energies and whether it's people's emotions. I can sense earthquakes before they happen like not like three or four days i'm not like nostradamus or anything but almost immediately before hundred like I call it my earthquake sense, because the air gets very still big and. And then there'll be an earthquake, the first time it ever happened was during the whittier quake back in the 80s. But. I also have an extreme sensitivity to electronics like there's always this buzzing going on in my head. That hasn't been there, my whole life because there was a time when we didn't have our TV on all the time we didn't have wi fi we didn't have cell phones and it just seemed like life was a little slower and life was a little bit easier, whereas now. When I when I first started social media, it was fun if you shouldn't have to use your real name it was kind of a goof off thing that you could do, and you could just be somebody else meet people, but now it's almost like you have to be you. And you have to be attached to your phone and if you don't answer your phone and you don't answer your voicemail and you don't answer your text messages or your. email it's like there's always something, and so I feel inundated sometimes with technology, and with that constant home. When when I lived in 29 palms I would go up to the joshua tree National Park, a lot. Because that's where you can just go and turn the engine off in your car and you were just in that enveloping silence that only only being out in nature, without any electronics around you will bring and the buzzing stopped in my ears. So I don't know if it's just that. That I tend to be really sensitive to just about everything. Well it's raining really bad outside. um. i'm not i'm not sure exactly it's always been really hard for me to talk about stuff like that, because I don't want people to think i'm weird or that i'm over exaggerating or that."
748.0,Provider,You know I am a big believer in all of them.
16184.0,Patient,"Okay. I remember reading an article about these people in Europe that like literally live in caves. Because they have to disconnect from I think it's called EMF sensitivity, or something."
748.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
16184.0,Patient,"And I thought at first, I thought it was all you know pseudoscience but then I realized, you know yeah like right now my tv's on and it's on pause and there's this residual home in my head and. I only know that it's because of electronics, because when we had when we we've gone through blackouts everything gets very still because there's nothing electronic running in the background. So its own. between that and having to finally come to terms with the dissociative episodes that I have. i've. i've talked about the D realization or depersonalization that i've gone through before and it wasn't until like my 30s that I realized that was not a thing that everybody does. But the whole I used to have a lot better grasp of kind of covering for myself when I would lose track of time or someone would insist that I did something and I remember it or a TV show that I supposedly watch that I couldn't recall. But it almost feels like it's getting worse older that I get and I don't know. It sucks for me, because I feel like it's such an onion it's such a layered multi faceted thing it's physical issues, combined with mental health issues, combined with a really crummy childhood. Coupled with. it's between the mental the physical health, the environmental stuff and. You know all of that kind of together it's and and probably hormones, because i'm 43 now and i'm probably going through pre menopause. So it's like all these different things are contributing so it's very hard to get my my bearings my ground it almost feels like i'm at the beach and the water is pushing the sand out from underneath my feet just I think I have my footing. Because it's it's not always easy to determine what I need or why I need it because i'm not always sure of the catalyst there's so many different variables that impact me that it's very difficult to look at things. From an objective standpoint. And the only way I can do it is by intellectualizing everything which does mean absolutely no good. Because here I am prattling on about you know. Everything I learned out of books in an effort to try to teach myself about myself and how to accept my. My neurology and how to. kind of get over that stigma."
748.0,Provider,That I keep hearing is that you're trying to figure it all out instead of letting others.
16184.0,Patient,"it's hard, because I don't know who to trust, like my my husband. did all that stuff on the phone with my father to where the to the point where my father won't even talk to me. I have kind of given up on. Pursuing relationships, because I just feel like it's. Beating against something and and constantly facing resistance and second guessing myself and wondering if people are mad at me and. And it stinks because my younger son constantly asked me if i'm mad and i'll have to tell him no hunter i'm not mad at you, and if I were I would let you know I don't stay mad forever I get it out. But when it comes to it's almost like i'm talking to my younger self when I talked to him because I remember, being a kid and growing up and always having that feeling that what I said was wrong what I was thinking was wrong i'm. Not normal which I hate that word normal it's just someone story you haven't heard yet. But it may be a societal norm, I guess. I just. it's almost like the whole thing with my father my father's very well off, he was in the marine corps, he was an officer in the ring for college educated. And he. Had this impossible standard everything needed to be clean everything needed to be organized everything needed to be just so. And if you deviated from that at all, you were a reflection on him, and so it was very hard to go from growing up in a trailer with my mother and getting abused really badly. To being in this upper middle class scene and having the impossible standards of another human being, I believe my father's on the spectrum as well. I know that my grandmother has mentioned that he had to they would send him to office to take coffee breaks and they wanted to put him on instead of means, and that was back in the 60s and it was a common treatment, I guess, for ADHD what they just called hyperactivity back then. But ADHD has a lot of similarities to autism I just think it's at the higher end of that functionality spectrum. And it's also one of the reasons why I think they have such horrible people skills and either come across as trying to be a chameleon and fit into well or I come across as being really high brown overeducated. and When I was in school I didn't qualify for special education, so I was just thrust into mainstream classroom or advanced placement classes and just told the sink or swim and everything was super. I know that my father was trying to come from that parental paranoia that you get like I don't want my kids to have to struggle or suffer like I did. I really believe that that's where my father's coming from he's just sucks it vocalizing it but he's very harsh when I got when I got pregnant with my older son he didn't speak to me for eight years. And I think that's what he was telling my older son with you know we've been down this path, before. And I wanted so badly just tell him. I didn't know how to approach you I didn't know how to talk to you and Kathy was going through this thing with her breast cancer, because I didn't want it to be like used to tell me when I was a kid and I was. Trying to be the Center of attention because it wasn't like that. It was just I didn't know how to articulate or express things that I was going to sort of either internalize them or I would go out and. use drugs or something so they didn't have to feel because when you feel the world of the stereo it's it's deafening. It feels like that it's deafening and you can't I don't have a filter to block that out, I wish I did, it would probably be a lot easier for me if I were like emotionally flat and."
748.0,Provider,What happens.
16184.0,Patient,When you're.
748.0,Provider,Connected to that spiritual realm that you connected with when you were in treatment.
16184.0,Patient,"When I got out of when I got out of the ranch I felt, because when I was there I did feel a connection, I felt very spiritual In fact I brought prayer home with me and. I there's been psychological studies on the power of prayer it's actually effective I don't know if it's the placebo effect or if it's just positive thinking, but I I grapple a lot with Christianity, because. I. Because it's very hard to talk to evangelical Christians who believe that you know everything the Bible is literal. yeah on."
748.0,Provider,That one thing know them spiritual connection.
16184.0,Patient,"And so I think that's where I kind of come from because i've studied almost every major world religion, I took philosophy I my original major in college, I was double majoring in archaeology and philosophy and then I went back when I went back that was psychology with a minor in philosophy. But I think a lot of that searching very deep. It almost felt like. pascal's wager. Like believe in God, because if you don't believe in God and there is a God then you're going to go to hell, if you believe in God and there's not a God, well then you just lived your life good. So I felt a little bit hypocritical, especially when I I. Organized religion, the dogma, something I struggle with because. I hate you I and i'm going to interrupt you because."
748.0,Provider,"We have to stop in a couple of minutes and I want to, I want to emphasize i'm not asking you about a religion. I learned that when you were doing spiritual readings and you call the prayer it could be meditation it could be. Reading."
16184.0,Patient,"it's hard to. it's hard for me to meditate because I have a hard time visualizing I don't visualize things I think of everything in words so when i've tried to meditate. Unless it's just completely focusing on the physical aspect like tighten up your feet and slowly release them it's very hard like I can't picture a beach I can't picture. They have a word for it, I think it's a fantasia where you just don't have a mind's eye and that's why grounding techniques can be kind of hard for me. Because, all I have a bloodhounds knows I can hear everything. But focusing on a specific sense can sometimes be overstimulating."
748.0,Provider,What about listening to a meditation.
16184.0,Patient,What.
748.0,Provider,What about listening to a meditation.
16184.0,Patient,"I listen to meditation also works. it's hard, because my go to is always to help other people. I know."
748.0,Provider,it's your turn.
16184.0,Patient,yeah. My son my youngest.
748.0,Provider,unraveling all of the things you. know more. figuring out just receiving. Let.
16184.0,Patient,"My youngest my younger son mentioned that to me, we were praying the other night before dinner. And I said the prayer right, you know, ask for blessings for animals, and for my family even my my soon to be ex husband both of my kids just said, wonderful things about my kids and then I closed my prayer and my younger son said don't forget yourself mom. I never thought yourself."
748.0,Provider,"Exactly so that is your assignment, for your next two weeks."
16184.0,Patient,Trying to not feel like i'm being selfish or over indulgent and just trying to take time out for me.
748.0,Provider,"Exactly and when that voice arises that says you're selfish, which is what cultivates that feeling your response is I no longer allow abuse, because that's an abuse force. So we are going to start working on self compassion."
16184.0,Patient,I think that's probably one of the biggest areas I struggling.
748.0,Provider,I know because I hear you.
16184.0,Patient,And I don't realize it because it's. automatically.
748.0,Provider,"it's like having asking a fish, how they like the water. What why. Your you are so conditioned to keep going in these thought loops over and over about. You know well, I did this, and I did that and i've done this and i've done that, and I mean you're so accomplished and you're so smart and you're so acutely aware of so many layers of reality and presence and so forth, but there's no room for you. it's. For you."
16184.0,Patient,"I think it's because it's such an alien concept to me because I was abused, when I was a kid so it's very hard for me to. not feel guilty like when I when I get a treat I always get my kids to treat to because I don't want to be the kind of person that i'm like eating candy in front of my kids not offering them anything. I hear it's very like a given a given take thing if I feel like i'm doing 70% me and 30% someone else I forget that balance is always work that way it's never 5050. there's always gonna be somebody."
748.0,Provider,If somebody is starving to death and the person next to them has just had a meal young have to be both of them. And right now. we're starving to death.
16184.0,Patient,"I know that they they've utilized and when I was in therapy in the past it's the oxygen mask theory. Was that you know they tell you to put the oxygen mask over yourself and then there's other cultures, cultures, where they have famine, the parents will eat first and then feed their kids. So alien to me such an alien concept to because my my want us to make everything better around me not realizing that I can't make everything better around me until i'm better. And that's where I struggle."
748.0,Provider,So that's your affirmation for the next two weeks. I will commit. I am committed to making myself better so that I can make everything around me back. pain pinky. pinky.
16184.0,Patient,pinky so. I just I think I just need some tools to be able to identify. When i'm. Because you don't want to stub your toe and then go to the doctor and say I broke my foot run I don't I don't ever want to overstate how i'm feeling. So I tend to.
748.0,Provider,"Wait. yeah you sure, do you can't overstate it, that is your assignment, I want you to do that. came to him, where you pinky swore. You are putting you first that doesn't mean don't take care of your children, it means no more talking about what you've. What should work what the history is only talking about today i'm doing this self care today i'm doing this act of self compassion. And you pinky swore so i'm holding you to it."
16184.0,Patient,"Yes, I think that that's a good thing to work on a good starting point. Okay it's something i've neglected over the years, and when you go to therapy and all you do is like talk therapy or. or neurofeedback or biofeedback is like you can go through all of the therapies, but unless you. connect in some way you're just spouting off stuff that you've been. it's like."
748.0,Provider,"So I am holding you to it, and I hope that I will see you at the next session."
16184.0,Patient,"Yes, and i'm definitely sorry from it's not like I said, if."
748.0,Provider,"You don't need. me. You don't need to apologize to me, you need to apologize to you. You deserve love you deserve compassion, you deserve care you just serve support you deserve help and the way that's going to happen is by you saying those words to yourself okay."
16184.0,Patient,Yes.
748.0,Provider,"i'll see what the next. session next time. If you don't come i'm in a hunch again. I almost did it, the last time, but I decided no I don't know what's going on. Now you know."
