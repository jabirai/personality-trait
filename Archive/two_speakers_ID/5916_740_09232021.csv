740.0,Provider,"Okay, how do you like the meeting, what do you get out of the meeting."
5916.0,Patient,"i'm just some other people sharing you know, sometimes. You know you'll hear someone's story, that is, I mean everybody's story is pretty much the same, but sometimes you'll hear one you know it's inspirational or kind of. You know."
740.0,Provider,each other share.
5916.0,Patient,"i'm just when I take my clean chips. yeah. yeah my last trip, we took was a year. or share briefly."
740.0,Provider,"But after collecting anything chips, do you just sharing the meeting, because just because."
5916.0,Patient,"No, no, you should just listen to other people."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, why do you not share."

740.0,Provider,"Okay do your wife goes to the same me. Yes, no. No, no, no me McCoy. was because. So let me hit me happy yeah and I haven't said this to another person who. hear me his wife actually shared plane date some i'm gonna say i'm gonna say this. So when you go to meeting this your recovery."
5916.0,Patient,Okay.
740.0,Provider,"Right y'all don't share recovery. there's your recovery. And a lot of times when you have your staff there, it can cause you to be reluctant to actually share."
5916.0,Patient,Are you.
740.0,Provider,i'm not saying that she's the reason but nine times out of 10 and that's one of the reason why you could be reluctant maybe everyone to share.
5916.0,Patient,I see because.
740.0,Provider,"because sometimes she may do some they may get a generic a day or she may do something, whatever they they may have picked you are, you may want to share in group, but you can share because she said, my next their next you would like you to ask. Like oh no no. The Variety is individualistic. So therefore she needs to go to her own meetings. You need to go to your own meeting. it's different you know i'm saying is one thing to go to share and go maybe every now I mean. yeah but to go to the same meeting all the time, know that that hinders your recovery that does not progress your recovery."
5916.0,Patient,The suit you're saying.
740.0,Provider,That you're gonna make.
5916.0,Patient,yeah absolutely.
740.0,Provider,And also too. If if there's a there's a saying and I tell my clients all the time they're blind people take lead blind people. Right so y'all both the recovery and you're both got the same amount of recovery time. yeah so much you can say to help you.
5916.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
740.0,Provider,"She can be up on your hair. on the back of your neck a paddle your bed and and try to come to you as much as she can, but the thing about it is you're trying to grow. you're trying to be a better version of yourself, and how can see teach you how to be the better version. If she's trying to grow and be a better version of herself. Oh yeah you're saying. That both came the. black and. yellow both john and grow it'd be different if she had it she got like 10 years as a bratty. erratic. She had the same amount of time you got."
5916.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"So basically you just kind of use the hiring young fans to kind of dump your stuff on her yeah i'm saying. The same time that's the stuff that you don't want to hurt that's the stuff, we need to dump in these meetings."
5916.0,Patient,yeah oh yeah.
740.0,Provider,"You know i'm saying. Because, eventually, you know right now it's no big deal but down the road you know i'm saying it can it can literally i'm kind of. Come between you and it can basically cause an unhealthy relationship."
5916.0,Patient,mix them.
740.0,Provider,"Because you don't saying, she has issue that she needs to work out food. yeah happening, you have right once you go to buy it is gonna be all right. We didn't came news bar we're going to keep on moving. it's all right, you keep on trucking fleet back now I mean what. You can I mean it's more than it was. about it is. Is that you could only help her to the extent that you would help. Does that make sense."
5916.0,Patient,yeah absolutely.
740.0,Provider,So we need different meeting.
5916.0,Patient,All right.
740.0,Provider,"And you need to share. cuz she can't she can't smell, he is right, that is, the port. yeah they say. You know i'm saying. But the people in those meetings, some people got 23 years what the cleaning time. Right so i'm going to people got about 30 years or 40 years was playing time you were playing time. yeah let me they didn't been there, done that, and they can tell you that they can they can look at you and say hey man you hidden down the wrong road now, you might want to make this time you're right they're not because you keep going down. you're saying you need you want people who can help develop you and make you a better a better version of yourself."
5916.0,Patient,make sense.
740.0,Provider,"yeah i'm saying i'm not sure I am trying to come down hard on young chandeliers i'm just trying to you know help you out because. It is just a suggestion, because i've seen these things happening i've been assessed to be sort of pants almost seven years i've seen this happen. When when people talk and fatter than 1000 and i'm like well who your support person all my family or my boyfriend my girlfriend all kinds and i'm like what do you have. What do you can find it will work i've seen it split people apart. yeah you i'm saying, because recovery is a big deal it's a huge deal."
5916.0,Patient,I know that.
740.0,Provider,"The fact that y'all are doing it together is amazing. yeah I would never ever take that away from you yo yo see what happens is. When you do everything together and you stuck up here, that means, God forbid, she followed me you fall. Because she's your own support system. Right y'all handle small you'd all sharing groups."
5916.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"So that means she called me and bringing in some dope. And what you're gonna do no, no, I mean if she's me only confidence, you know i'm saying and you're not and you don't have a sponsor or anything like that so really to really turn to us and then it's easy to fall with her and vice versa. yeah yeah i'm saying so long, everyone needs their own separate relationships will recovery. Does that make sense. No, no, you don't wanna I know you don't want to. i'm telling you because of the fact that i've seen that happen, a whole lot, and you know i'm saying a lot of times you know even with going either with. Going on this recovery journey, you know i'm saying is because it because you do have a live, because you do have made it into kind of cut the craving that's one thing, but I think people feel relaxed on the great out with the medicine. So they let me know that if it doesn't fix it."
5916.0,Patient,Right absolutely yeah.
740.0,Provider,"It is it just helps you manage. Right, that means you still have to do other things in place, and so let me say this is good to be in a relationship i'm not against it. is good to be a support to each other, this right. But at the same time she can be your sole support, and you can be herself before it."
5916.0,Patient,makes sense.
740.0,Provider,"In this case. So one day, sometimes you don't have phone at one of them base. yeah and and everybody needs an opportunity to be with the share. Rather, they feel. Without being judged or haven't used to be an argument at the half. yeah yeah i'm saying."
5916.0,Patient,My wife does have a she has a sponsor I just I don't have a sponsor. As.
740.0,Provider,"Well, Mr McCoy you need to follow the leader. i'm gonna say Lu ma ma ma she got to work on that, but here you go."
5916.0,Patient,yeah i'm.
740.0,Provider,"gonna tell you what. Is she is she is she talking to somebody and she got her some other hold accountable, the Miss Nicole who holds you accountable."
5916.0,Patient,For just myself. I know that.
740.0,Provider,You would have never thought of us in the first place.
5916.0,Patient,"Oh, I don't."
740.0,Provider,"yeah so yeah i'm saying it so you know she started on the right path, getting hurt, so the thing about it is you got to have somebody to be accountable to. You know I want to tell them what to do. I want to buy time, maybe we do them on one do. I didn't want to work my program the way I want to work it. And then, if it."
5916.0,Patient,"doesn't make sense, oh."
740.0,Provider,"info you know it just be it just being able to, because when you live, where you live a life of addiction addiction takes over your life to the point to where. Whatever you was doing before you got a DC in becomes. It vanishes. So, so now you develop now now what we're doing is we're developing, we have to develop new habits to counter the date depending. On thing and working as good. as easy as good. But you only work part time. yeah so that means we need to do something that's productive with the rest of our fans the fans. watching TV again trigger. Because we're talking about to shoot it. yeah yeah i'm saying so yeah what we gonna do with Nicole what's your ideas, what else What else do you, what are the habits, do you think you came. What is something that you all want to try."
5916.0,Patient,to quit smoking.
740.0,Provider,"Okay. I just recently had a patient who he said he quit smoking he saw us, and he stopped smoking."
5916.0,Patient,hard.
740.0,Provider,"Is because the thing about it is if they will start a habit, we started what we keep a habit to stop ahead. yeah so we put that we put the dope damn what will keep the cigarettes, because we still need they both."
5916.0,Patient,"ya know I know could be done, I just don't do it."
740.0,Provider,"yeah and then this is about, if you wanted. yeah i'm saying, because it's possible i've seen people do it too many times. yeah yeah i'm saying it just basically finding something else to give you this a rewarding feeling that you find in the nicotine. kind of another thing. yeah So what is something else that gives you the same reward and failing."
5916.0,Patient,and
740.0,Provider,"And that's the beauty of it is that you can go find out. You know it, because there's not enough TV. Jim saying you can go find out, I mean picking up a hobby what is something that you all want to do."
5916.0,Patient,I used to hate.

740.0,Provider,Okay What else do you like more impatient.
5916.0,Patient,"Well, not really not too many places to see where i'm at to go fishing and mercury home screen. So I mean that's My big there, maybe, but there's not too many places that you know close by. But."
740.0,Provider,you like.
