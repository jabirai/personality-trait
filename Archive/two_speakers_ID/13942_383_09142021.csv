13942.0,Patient,"yeah you know I nursed her for two and a half years, and I remember when I was you know at the time, so it was with my mom you know when things got bad with the ex go to my moms and. He would call and say like Oh, you know, I was never about Marion you know, he would call and say like oh I miss you like, when you coming back and i'm like. I like right now, like I don't know when i'm coming back right now, but if you want to come pick up your daughter. You know, take her out to eat take her to your dad's you know, by all means coming you know you know pick her up and take her out and we were only about like 2.5 miles away from him at the time, and he wouldn't even drive to come and see her pick her up or anything so he. he's not like a part of her life, like that you know, so I mean it's really hard, like, I said that little girl is just always with me."

Having experiences, you know because they they live, where there's like horses, they take care of horses and stuff you know, so I feel like she is, but I just know how he is kind of in like I see like little things and. You know, like she tripped with his phone and he oh my goal my phone you know and. He thought was like his first reaction and Marianne didn't even want to take his phone to talk to me again because you know I don't know if she was embarrassed or you know there's there's that lack of empathy in him so that's. Just kind of what i'm concerned about you know. Like him and his dad you know this like you're not a person, you know it's like."
383.0,Provider,"Right. there's. More just more that sense of that that she's just a child, and she doesn't necessarily have. That is that what you're saying by. Okay, when you said she's not a person could you describe to me what you mean by that."
13942.0,Patient,"yeah like. like an object, I feel like you know cuz all he he ever you know, like when I had her he didn't.

13942.0,Patient,"I have my mom and my cousin I. You know I kind of isolated myself from all my friends, because. You know justin didn't really want me having any friends or even being close to my mom it would you know cause arguments. pretty much because my mom would say he's what are you doing with him he's not good for you and so he didn't like that. But I yeah I really don't have any friends, right now, but I would definitely say my mom is my biggest support right now."
383.0,Provider,Okay okay great um do you have any hobbies or interests things stuff you enjoy doing.

383.0,Provider,"um. So um what, what do you what gives you the most joy and pleasure in your life."
13942.0,Patient,"let's say my daughter, but I don't. know so."
383.0,Provider,I just wanted to let you know I really I really feel and. pain that you're in you know being apart from your daughter and. i'm sorry that you're going through this. Could you describe to me a little bit more around the situation that occurred. Where you're the CPS got involved. You said you were having a mental breakdown. Where you describe a little bit about what that was. What brought that on.
13942.0,Patient,"yeah um well right before you know it was. justin had. started drinking and there is constant conflict for like three days straight, you know I would. I would try and get Marianne to sleep, you know and thinking Oh, this is my safe zone like i'll be able to get her down without him. doing what he does you know, like just constant conflict, and you know, he would go in the room. And just start going off and i'm like you're gonna wake her up like you know, so I ended up like I would hide in my mom's car. So you know I can be away from him, you know my mom told him, you know you're not listening to her, you need to give her a break you gotta stop this email and. I would go ahead and my mom's car and he would come back in the House until his brother, you know that he saw me with some guy walking down the street. You know, when I was trying to hide from her so I told him, you know, like I need a break like we can't be with you right now so after I got married and down to bed, I came out of the bedroom and he took off to as moms you know and. And by that time I was so sleep deprived and not eating like I could go almost a whole day without eating from all the stress like I started getting really bad pains in my stomach you know."
383.0,Provider,We were you trying to speak to your daughter from your exes drinking problems.
13942.0,Patient,"Yes, he he. I don't really know like when you started by do know the last three days during this conflict, he was drinking and he. I wouldn't say he was like physically abusive or anything like that, but I didn't notice, you know I mean he. punched himself in front of her you know he punched him in the face and stuff so I. pretty much with take Marion and go into another room and then I had you know his dad or whatever they're saying like gotta relax you know but. During the time I didn't have anywhere to go, you know, so I was just trying to have my main focus on Marianne and you know either taking her into the room and doing things with her going out for a walk you know."
383.0,Provider,"In the meantime, your access is kind of drinking and out of control."
13942.0,Patient,"kinda yeah he you know, he was all like let's go for a ride in my car, you know and i'm like Americans not getting in the car with you, you know, like you were drinking and he comes back and he hit a parked car or he got all cleaned up he brushed his teeth and all this. To me, I don't see how the COPs didn't notice that he was drinking honestly he got very, very friendly with them and. They it's not in the police report at all that he was drinking."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so so there was. Chaos going on in the household and a problem with you feeling safe with your daughter."
13942.0,Patient,"and keeping you on hold me know like you guys keep this up, you know, like there's you know someone's in a call you know cuz he was yelling and we are arguing, and it wasn't during those three days there wasn't it wasn't healthy."
383.0,Provider,"And how that happened before, and in other occasions on other occasions."
13942.0,Patient,"I would say not where he's been drinking but. it's almost like walking on eggshells, you know i'm like Okay, if I don't save this or I act a little different maybe I won't cause an argument, but still no matter what link the littlest things you know and. took it in these moods you know where it can last anywhere from eight hours until you go to sleep at night, you know, and you wake. up in the morning he's like. Why aren't you happy. And i'm like you know, so there was arguing and.
