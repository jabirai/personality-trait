15733.0,Patient,"i'm good, how are you."
148.0,Provider,i'm good Thank you. what's been going on since we last spoke.
15733.0,Patient,Nothing really major thing is. looking for a new job. my previous jobs.
148.0,Provider,Oh.
15733.0,Patient,that's pretty big yeah yeah.
148.0,Provider,yeah all right.
15733.0,Patient,About a week since that happened but i'm. Not too worried about. Something I haven't dealt with before so.
148.0,Provider,Can I ask. Why you quit your previous job.
15733.0,Patient,"um the management, there was just kind of a very dramatic about a lot of unnecessary things and. For the skill sets that I have like in a in a in a coffee shop environment and a brief certainly like based on the brief experience I had like I felt like I wasn't really getting treated right and a lot of things and. Then they my our department manager one talking about something and. Like I wasn't I wasn't wearing a hair that that day, and she got back to me, and she started like yelling at me and stuff in the inner Office like and I like I wasn't being combative or anything she just I don't know she was having a bad day or what but. She said she sent me home and it just the situation, which is a lot and I didn't feel like it was worth working there with all the mental strain of paper on me, sometimes I just quit. So yeah."
148.0,Provider,"Well, it sounds like it's a really healthy decision for you and your overall health."
15733.0,Patient,"yeah I already liked the day that I didn't I wasn't planning on it, because the day after that incident happened like HR the HR representative wanted to talk to me and. I had already previously called and quit that morning and I kind of just made the decision in that moment, because they just sweat felt right. Because, especially like I been a brief on a lot of other places and it's never been so like mentally exhausting. and expand and they just didn't make sense, especially given like it's in a hospital, so I expected it to be a little more, you know put together than. You know when i've worked with like literally shift to a teenager sick before, and that was less dramatic and then what I was dealing with so just yeah it was healthier for me just to leave."
148.0,Provider,wow okay all right good so you're feeling good about your decision you're feeling happy with with quitting.
15733.0,Patient,yeah.
148.0,Provider,"And I know that you were working really late and long hours, so how is it felt to have this last week off from work."
15733.0,Patient,"um it's Nice, I mean I love being like I love alone like alone time and having time to just kind of like mentally and physically recharge myself. But you know I kinda I get bored I don't like. Early have friends and hang out with anything so i'm not working and usually just at home, which isn't necessarily a problem, but you know i'd like to get out and go do things sometimes."
148.0,Provider,yeah i'm outside of work and being at home is there anything that you like to do or anybody that you like to see.
15733.0,Patient,"i'm not really a lot of the friends that i've had i've had either moved away or you know things happen and I are kind of focusing more on my goal of wanting to move. later next year. And so just given that to in mind, I I kind of do hold myself back a little bit socially, because I know I don't plan on being here for that long. And i'm kind of just putting my like refocusing all of my energy towards making a goal from moving and getting that kind of getting like financially stable before I decided to move and stuff like that so it's kind of what helps with finding a new job comes into play too just because. I need something that i'll be able to grow off of when I move from here and stuff like that so."
148.0,Provider,Have you thought anymore about where you want to go.
15733.0,Patient,"yeah I think. I think, ultimately, my I always end up playing with wanting to be like Washington or Seattle like specifically. And just kind of like After talking it through, for the last couple months like with just with myself and talking to my family about it that's probably what i'll end up doing. So."
148.0,Provider,"Okay, good say you're leaning more towards because I think the last time we spoke you weren't really sure, yet I think you through Tennessee out there."
15733.0,Patient,"yeah so my my my family will ultimately end up moving there. And I didn't originally ever like fully want to do that, it was kind of just the easiest option. Because my grandpa was going to be moving and it was just an easy way for me to move somewhere else and. movie been very inexpensive but ultimately I don't feel like I personally want to go there, or like would enjoy being there. So that's what kind of led me more towards the decision of like I should move somewhere that I will benefit from like in every aspect or as many aspects as possible."
148.0,Provider,And what makes you choose Seattle.
15733.0,Patient,"um i've been there a few times in high school over the summer and I always really loved it. I one thing that really gets me there, too, is like a weather person I hate the heat I hated being like sunny super sunny all the time, so you know living here in the middle of the desert is awful for me I hate the summer here. But so like I really do enjoy the weather there, I mean just the terms that have been there, I really, really enjoy it I love the culture and the diversity, there too, so. yeah."
148.0,Provider,"yeah and I. Do here. you're looking for that too it's just you know, cultural diversity and. yeah being able to just you know be yourself and be. mm hmm."
15733.0,Patient,"yeah I really want to be able to move somewhere where I can like live my like my 20s I was like comfortably as myself, like personally and physically."
148.0,Provider,"or yeah so that sounds like it's gonna be a really good it's gonna be a really positive move for you. yeah good and and that you know that comes up a lot, when we talk so is that is that weighing on you are you feeling excited about it, are you feeling stressed about it, like what's coming up for you around this change because it's such a big change."
15733.0,Patient,"Is it something that I wanted to do for a really long time like since I was in high school i've always just wanted to move I didn't like living here. i've always been the type of person like wanting to go other places to explore like different environments and different cultures and stuff like that and different people and stuff like that. and I have tried before like right after high school I tried to move to Oregon and I had a roommate and then that fell through and I ended up like literally moving back like a week later. And so it's always been something that i've been like yearning for and pushing for and. It just you know it was one of those things that you can really want it really bad, but you just you can't put the energy into it now because it's not going to happen now. And I finally within this last year, like pretty much all 2020 have time to just reassess things and then you know, for the first time ever i'm. You know, doing therapy i'm on medications now so i'm mentally healthier, which is allowing me to have that energy to want to put into an end goal or a you know, a bigger goal like moving out of state. And like relocating my entire life but it's nothing but excitement that I feel about it it's I I don't feel scared about it, I don't have anxiety about it. it's just I I only I only can feel positive about it, and I think that once I get there, it will be, probably the best decision that i've made thus far so."
148.0,Provider,that's good that's a huge statement right there in itself so you're just all around ready. you're ready you're ready to relocate you're ready for you know to meet new people um yeah I just hear that you're ready.
15733.0,Patient,"yeah especially too because, like you know I can just say this, the first time i've ever gotten my mental health, you know worked on and. regulated and so that's one thing and like also like I have like I. Have reconnected with my family so like we're in more constant communication, and you know my mom understands that I want to move and go places so it's kind of like everything's just kind of in place now and getting ready. So now, I feel comfortable you know setting my goal for later next year, like a year from now, and giving myself, now that I feel equipped to do it like no actually have to do it, you know."
148.0,Provider,"Okay So what does that goal look like, for you, if we were to kind of. lay it out, what are the steps towards getting to Seattle."
15733.0,Patient,"um I just mostly the biggest problem is just I need to get together financially i've never really been a good bike financial person I. I don't make a lot of money, but I spend a lot of money. So I just need to kind of get back together and before I wasn't really at a point where I felt that the goal was closer than it had been before, so I didn't really feel motivated to like save and try to do things like that. But now I I i'm ready to do that, so I think that that's the I know that's the biggest thing that I have to do is, I have to you know build up some money and save some money and. Then the rest will come with I have the money, I can you know find places to live, I can start finding jobs out there, like all that I have to wait to do. as well, but. yeah so just fine here's where I guess what I feel is what I need to focus on."
148.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and what i'm hearing is that that the spending piece is probably. um i'm. almost like a little bit of filling a void, for you just because you're missing so much right now and you're missing that like. You you're yearning for this fulfillment and you just don't have it where you're at right now, so that spending could be a little bit you know. Around filling that void and then, once you move once you have enough saved up and you move you're going to have this like new found right like this new. Film in, and so I think that it'll be a little bit easier to manage money but that's just something to keep in mind for right now, I think."
15733.0,Patient,um yeah.
148.0,Provider,"I know that you know, once you get to where you want to be you're not going to have this void anymore that you're going to want to fill with like spending money or you know, whatever it may be yeah yeah."
15733.0,Patient,"yeah I could do that already to just i'm with him last few months and then just you know seriously starting to think about it, because. I just been like probably last month decided well now i'm going to set my year marker like i'm going to give myself till next December to. Have all the money in order to move and then hopefully you know, move, either, if I, if I can, by the end of the next by the end of next year move right into next year, if I have to wait a whole year to save that money then i'll wait at the beginning of the following year. But just with those kind of things in mind, I can even tell it's different just because the motivation for wanting to save and become more financially stable for that end goal is there, like that motivation is there, so."
148.0,Provider,"Wonderful yeah really good work around that you know talking yourself through it and just seeing the end goal and where you know you, you want to be and what you're willing to do to get there really work with that yeah and have you started looking for places at all just idea."
15733.0,Patient,"I did I did that, like a week or two ago, and then you know I knew it was going to be expensive, where I live, I mean here in fresno it's also expensive. it's not as expensive so. I kind of you know I know that's why you know I live with my family now because I didn't want it, I couldn't really afford to live by myself, even in fresno just because it is pretty expensive. So yeah I have looked and that's what I that's when I kind of made my my year goal to kind of get their financially. So yeah I have looked yes."
148.0,Provider,"Okay, so you have an idea you won't be shocked, you know, like me and. yeah okay yeah that's great um these are huge steps huge steps for you yeah really great progress um because I think the last time we talked about this. You had the idea right like you've known this for a while, like you said you've been thinking about this for a while, but you're actually putting things into place now like this is where i'm going to go. This is when I want to go some really, really huge steps they may seem like little steps, but you're doing great work. And then, how has your anxiety been."
15733.0,Patient,"um honestly it's not been that bad I expected it to be worse with you know quitting my job, and the drama and emotions that came around that last week. But leaving the employer, that I was working for like helps a lot honestly, it was just every day like there was just there was just a lot of unnecessary like emotions having to be handled when I was there. and yeah they were just and they were they were just very negative always be around so it's just having that not be something I have to deal with is already doing, like, I feel good about that. So yeah there's a little bit of anxiety about trying to find a job, I have been doing that, last week, just because I do need to get a job as soon as possible um. But yeah nothing too crazy i've been managing it pretty well I feel like."
148.0,Provider,"Given the circumstances, okay good yeah sounds like with the decision you made it go weight lifted off your shoulders."
15733.0,Patient,yeah.
148.0,Provider,"You know, we always you know when you make a good decision, the right decision for you and you feel relief right. yeah. From it so that's great and are you doing any deep breathing."
15733.0,Patient,"yeah usually just if I ever get too overwhelmed I will use that and just kinda heal physically work my work myself down, so I mentally can work myself down."
148.0,Provider,"Okay, good deep breathing yeah um any other tools that you're finding really helpful right now."
15733.0,Patient,"um. I guess you could say that, like my my planning and like emotional investment in setting goals and having an idea what I want to do like that kind of helps me a lot having that kind of end goal in sight and feeling it like getting closer. Definitely. helps relieve a lot of my anxiety, I feel like so yeah."
148.0,Provider,And you.
15733.0,Patient,"Just I was just saying just kind of focusing on what's next rather than you know. Like thinking more it's like what's like looking at more like what's next and and. You know, having a plan, rather than like. Dealing with it all, you know in that moment and I don't know. I don't know if I make sense."
148.0,Provider,yeah. it's almost like having something to look forward to gives you the motivation and the you know the commitment that you need to work towards this goal.
15733.0,Patient,yeah.
148.0,Provider,yeah I mean to me it sounds like you're in a really beautiful place right now of transition. yeah yeah this year I think it's gonna be think this is going to be a big year for you.
15733.0,Patient,yeah I didn't feel.
148.0,Provider,"yeah good awesome and you're doing the work that you need to do on yourself to make sure that you're healthy and you're making these choices to take care of yourself and put yourself first, and that is just that is so huge and sometimes really hard to do and you're doing it."
15733.0,Patient,"yeah. I feel like that's something I haven't. always been the best that like I take care of myself, but I usually let other things get in the way of that, and so I feel like that's just another change since i've been more mentally stable of. Taking action for myself that makes sense."
148.0,Provider,"yeah awesome really great work Marcus really great work. I want to get you scheduled, because I do have somebody right after you today at 130 so I want to get you scheduled for your next individual."
15733.0,Patient,I did have I did have a quick question to. yeah so I wasn't able to get scheduled with Dominique at all this mode. And they don't have any scheduled to meet with somebody until like the 17th of January i'm about to run out of both of my medications and i've tried to request refills like through my pharmacy and. they're just having been any required yet So is there any way that you can contact me to let her know any there's refills.
148.0,Provider,"To do it through her, but what you can do is drop in on one of her groups again and just let her, I am here because I needed to check in with you and I don't have an appointment till mid January, but i'm running on meds I need to refill Okay, you may have to do that again. which I don't think is a bad thing I know y'all yeah we'll definitely revisit talk about groups again but um. So maybe just do you have. You have. That room number for her groups that information still."
15733.0,Patient,yeah it's just the same group ID every week.
148.0,Provider,"And you don't have to check in anywhere first for groups for groups, you can just go straight to that room okay."
15733.0,Patient,"it's my it's the same time, every week so like Monday at nine."
