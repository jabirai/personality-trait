A lot of the time out that when I was out there, I was there for like little over two years it was on suboxone. And then I. use and then go back to suboxone. Actually he's been quite a bad influence on me, I think a lot of the times that i've used a had it not been for him, I wouldn't have have used. yeah not blaming him, but if he hadn't brought it around I wouldn't have gone out looking for it. So uh yeah so especially you know after I had my son, but so I found out, I was pregnant and I was using we were using heroin and smoking crack. Like not all you know it was starting to get bad. So, then, I. tried really hard and I got on suboxone and it wasn't easy and then he was using still but I, you know stayed on the suboxone. got off of the suboxone and then my son was you know born with nothing and. In his thumb and I was had enough, you know we both were clean. Then I stayed sober for. A couple months, and then I ended up."
759.0,Provider,With obscene.

And you know everyone was drinking or either you know doing drugs and just like being environment like we know, like in recovery teaches us our environment has everything to do with how we, you know, like how we react to it."
12630.0,Patient,"You know. Really. yeah it's like I really think that like well even you know going all the way back to when I first started using drugs, I had I had different support I don't think I ever would have used drugs to be honest. yeah so yeah i'm."

759.0,Provider,"So, and when was your first time to use and again opiates."
12630.0,Patient,"um when I, so I guess i'd like tried bike it in and stuff when I was like 16 maybe. Then. I would get really bad migraine so I ended up having to go to the hospital and getting like pain shots and that's when like I would get diluted and. morphine and stuff like that, but I didn't really know like you know, I was not going there at all for the drugs, I was going. There solely because I had migraines I didn't even know like what those things were. So, like I had you know those times and then, when I was 19 I had already like been drinking a lot like you know any chance, I could get since I was like 15 six like 16 I was you know anything I could to like escape or whatever. So drug drinking other drugs cocaine overdose on cocaine, when I was 15 so, then I stopped doing, I never did it, but I didn't do it again till I was. Like 20. I guess it didn't quite close it was like a massive panic attack and then. Like little air sacs in my lungs like they got holes in them from like breathing. too heavy whatever and so yeah that happened and then after that I started having really, really severe panic attacks and anxiety after that situation, and then they put me on xanax and then I was on all kinds of psych meds and everything. And then later I was prescribed like so much and. narcotic like headache medication and all this stuff you know when I was like 1718 so been prescribed all different kinds of drugs and whatnot and then my mom when I was 19 my mom was having a neck surgery, and she was prescribed the 80 milligram oxy cotton. I. took some from her, and then I was started like snorting it. And I started buying them and then. You know, it turned into heroin, because it was cheaper and. So I started smoking heroin and then I saw on the news like you could buy needles over the counter. In La county I live in orange county so I went over there in long beach and bought some needles and I googled how to shoot it up and then from there, it was you know anything I could put into a needle I would you know. Do it, but it was opiates every day."

I was just really so sad and depressed and like you know life at home, my mom was on she was an alcoholic and on drugs and stuff and my step dad sold drugs, and it was just I had nobody. to talk to you and stuff like that, so I you know was really depressed I don't know if I like thought about killing myself a lot.

Doing drugs like they're the ones that kind of got me really on federal at beth again so. You know that was really bad and my mom was really like. horrible like a monster honestly like when she does drugs it's very bad and I think that, like if the scientific world the medical world she would be like diagnosed like like D ID or like multiple personalities.

Really scary like I was I just remember being like scared like. all the time. Because my dad was like super unpredictable or like a stable, you know, like what it know like. How he would be when he'd come home from work. You know if you'd be like. super in a good mood and like bring home like a kitten or something you know, like. That weird like you know, like super happy in a good mood or come home and just like completely be like insane and like. You know kick the dog or or like you know throw like a flower vase or stuff like that, like. My dog our dog we had like a big. samoyed like big fluffy white dog. In red when my dad came home, it was so scared ran upstairs and jumped out the window like. yeah so like that's how it was and then mostly like my brother would go outside and play and I was more definitely more like a whole body but anyway, other than that, though I think I was like. thinking that if I stayed at home, like my mom like I maybe would be like God is bad or like I just didn't want to be bad to happen to my Bob I guess I don't know. But yeah like I would you know, try to I think sometimes I would like try to tell them to stop or whatever, but then other times, mostly had to just be alone, like in my room like crying or whatever. But I always like felt a sense of like comfort be in I felt like God was with me like I really felt that way. So that was like. The only way I guess I did like. got through it, I guess, with. yeah."

759.0,Provider,mm hmm. So yeah.
12630.0,Patient,"And then we would have to go over to his house, like every weekend and it was just like I was so anxious and like scared all the time when I would be with him, it was like I that I was so like freaked out all the time, but then also like did it feel like I felt like safe with him to. Have but you know I don't know it was weird. But like. You know, we would go over to his house and that like he was my mom was sober until we were like around the time when she had my dad like broke up. Then she really started drinking and like using pills and stuff a lot so she was like you know always like in a hurry to like drop us off at her dad's house. because she wanted to go out and whatever and then we will get to my dad's house and I remember like I guess after his dad died, I guess, he got like you know kind of a lot of money and. He told me he told us later like he's spent most of it on crack so like we go there and he would like it taken forever to open the door. you'd be like looking at the blinds. stuff like that, and you have like.

They call it like a wed reckless like. it's lesser than a dui but I. Like literally my parents didn't give a crap about like by legal problems like they did not healthy at all. Like with my my first of felony charge like it was at Christmas time to like a couple days before Christmas, like. And by Dale probably you know. They they could have probably build it out for like $200 it's like. nobody cared or helped me and I did you know that it was my first time getting in trouble for that, so I would have like fought it and you know, or at least take it a program that I completed the program it would have gotten a felony. But if I was in jail and I had to. Fight the case for inside the jail, I was going to do whatever I could to get out of there as fast as I could. So I just. died for the for the charge, and you know did a month that they, let me out that same thing happened for the second one.
