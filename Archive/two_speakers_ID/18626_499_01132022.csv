Yes, and I explained to you on our first visit that as far as the planet and that's going to have to be weighing down and off at some point. we'll do it, slowly but that's just you know the rule here and in Mississippi is already the law and that's kind of what it shifted into. To Tennessee so bright heart healed is already trying to get in the habit of doing that because what happens is when they make it a law they tell you to stop right now. And then you end up sending people into withdrawals and stuff so we're just working on Wayne and people have now before that happens, so what i'm going to do is i'll resume. That gap in at 600 milligrams three times a day for now and then I won't increase it until we start to decrease the klonopin okay. we're gonna do a lateral.

With the people that gave you the the regular suboxone we're going to continue your. quantity and at the 0.5 milligrams big will do that for the next you know, probably at least the next few weeks. You know, maybe even a month. And we'll we'll do the gabba pain 600 milligrams. Three times a day for the next you know few weeks to a month and then i'll go up on that gabba pin and go down, you know, on the on the klonopin okay."
18626.0,Patient,Okay sounds.
499.0,Provider,"Good any questions and i'm gonna have to first ask you, though, oh my gosh. You know. Like i'm new i'm new to this. Company so like it's a lot of stuff going on and like I was at work, and I was getting like message after message at the. Venture prescription and i'm like I don't want to be rude you know because i'm new but i'm like. I would not stop working the job that's paying me right now. To do something and we're off the clock, or like i'm like and you're like I had a pack came in a patient at fall and I was like chaos and i'm like I can't i'm like tasting the woman i'm like you're gonna have to give me an hour. I will do an hour I swear."
18626.0,Patient,"yeah, it was because we had. snow snow storm here and every pharmacy started closing in the pharmacist. So, like every pharmacy I went to my doctor. So I just waited until the next day, and then I call see was I was like why even leave do have it. And yeah."
499.0,Provider,"Okay, and a couple more things um. Let me pull up your own. check and see if you have any surveys there do. All right, so in one survey, which is the. The Bam survey. Okay okay. Have you had your labs yet."

18626.0,Patient,yeah and like we went through so many of them. And then pop up on the gavel.
499.0,Provider,"Okay, so none of them kind of really we're really effective."
18626.0,Patient,"You know and it's like there's like to that like just like naming really angry like. Okay, like I just I don't know, and so I just that's why we ended up, they did a decent the doctor does some type of DNA thing."
499.0,Provider,"Was they did the swab and send it off, and they tell you what meds are best for you what doesn't work yeah."
18626.0,Patient,yeah and Dr.
499.0,Provider,Marco or he laughing site.
18626.0,Patient,"yeah the jeans like yeah. yeah like I can't believe they made you do, that he said I don't go by that and all he was like, but he says, at least it, he said, at least you're on the right medicine, he said, because the ones that showed that work for me was the medications I was on so."
499.0,Provider,"Okay okay all right couple of more things so well let's finish up with the depression so just kind of keep yourself in check, you know you know yourself, of course, a lot better than I know you. If you do start to feel like you're having any suicidal thoughts or you're just getting so overwhelmed, then we might have to start you on something but i'm gonna need you to let me know that you feel like that you know I do need something. Right and, at the end of every visit i'm always going to tell you this i'm going to remind you of the number two the one 800 suicide lie in the one 800 273 talk, if you have any issues. And also, as far as bright heart health issues, if you have a problem with your prescription need to cancel or reschedule an appointment, make sure that you just checking in at the virtual clinic. And also. Make sure that you reschedule those appointments, because if you don't like if you call in and you reschedule. Then they'll send me a message and i'll and i'll give you a brief prescription to your next appointment, but if you just flat out no show you reduce the chance of not giving your medication into your next visit okay. Okay, all right any other questions or concerns for me today. No all right, I am going to get those three prescriptions in and actually let me see something, let me see if they've already scheduled you multiple appointments or not."
18626.0,Patient,They have. In. It so today and then.
499.0,Provider,In a week and next few thursday's.

To lyrica so today, along with the klonopin I will. restart patients gabapentin that she was on here recently, which was at a dosage of 600 milligrams three times a day we're going to remain on the klonopin 0.5 milligrams two times a day for now I did explain to the patient, because she. felt like the in the past that a higher dosage of gab opinion would have been better for her so I did let her know that eventually. We will go up on the gabba pin and go down on the on the defensive she's taking the survey takes patient is still breastfeeding three children so for now will remain on sub mutates she takes w takes eight milligrams. Two and a half tablets she was originally prescribed to last week but reports that she ran out early and looking at her prescription monitoring, other than the last, Doctor that she saw who gave her a seven day supply she was stable on two and a half tablets. Patient was. discussed program rules, the expectations with patient patient was good reminder of the virtual clinic number, and also the suicide and talk why she was. informed that she needed to do a Bam survey, and also that she would need to get her drug screen in because that might delay will that might prompt her to have to go to the pharmacy more often to pick up her medications Thank you."
