148.0,Provider,"Good Thank you it's been a while, since we've met."
10887.0,Patient,"Right long time no see. Yes, sorry about that."
148.0,Provider,how's it going.
10887.0,Patient,"it's okay uh i'm doing pretty good i'm feeling a pretty strong spirits oh my mind feels good i've got like 14 days sober today 14 exactly 14 days kept relapsing thanks for that um but you know it's just I guess about how you recovered rebound. Right now let's see I got suspended from work for calling in sick i've been back at work for like a week now and it's going good it's but it to me i'm like at it. Straight fork in the road if I relapse again and it's causing me to call in sick i'm very well likely i'm going to get fired. going to lose me on this apartment and you know my vehicle will be next and be back to nothing and so right now I just man it really feels like I feel like the pressure is on but i'll wanting to you know, take the challenge and accept it and push through this i'm."
148.0,Provider,i'm sorry go ahead.
10887.0,Patient,"i'll just say i'm trying to do something different, because I can't just keep going through do the same thing expecting now this time i'm going to be sober. So I was looking at past times when I was in the military and thinking about my mindset mentality, then and I started looking at these navy seals that post like you know. motivational things about mentality and mindset on on YouTube and watch your videos and i've got like a lot of their words like a lot of these. phrases and things that they say i'm just not talking about recovery they're just talking about life in general it is so. Like related to recovery and i'm like dance i've just really just been indulging this and listening to them every day. And I wrote down like jotted down like a page of these like phrases that are really sticking with me and i've been holding on to it, you know, I was thinking, I could run them by you and you could give me your feedback or let me know like yeah This is something that."
148.0,Provider,"yeah yeah love to hear them i've actually yeah i've seen those videos that you're talking loads motivational enter those videos and they're really powerful they have a lot to do with your mindset yeah and the way you think and. yeah. yeah lots around law of attraction work right because it, you know I thought, create our reality."
10887.0,Patient,Actually don't know much about the law of attraction i've heard of it obviously but i've never read into it.
148.0,Provider,Okay okay you ever heard of the secret.
10887.0,Patient,um there was a book right.
148.0,Provider,"yeah it's a book it's also a documentary on netflix I think it's still on netflix been on netflix for a while. yeah but around the same same stuff you know what you think, is what you create. yeah."
10887.0,Patient,"yeah our mind definitely um you know, whatever I put in my head or whatever I think about is going to end up you know translating into actions, what I do so."
148.0,Provider,"What happens with addiction is we get these addictive thoughts and a lot of times we don't identify them as addictive and risky thoughts which. is exactly what there are like you know that is your addiction talking to you that's your disease trying to take over again, you know when you have those relapses and the things that you tell yourself in those moments. Those aren't things that you would say when you're. I guess in your sober mind right."
10887.0,Patient,"yeah I was also realizing a big thing for me, a big fundamental shift this time is um. I forgot, and like old the idea that it's okay to feel bad and it's okay to have crappy feelings and emotions. Like that's where i'm going to grow I just need to sit through that and and have a tough attitude about it and fight through it. Before I mean for like the past year, two years whenever I feel like my head doesn't feel right, I feel depressed anxious whatever i'm like this is wrong there's something wrong saw immediately go and try and change it, you know, whatever. yeah barbecuing going to the beach even good, positive ways, but still it's like pleasure seeking still trying to make me feel good. When really now i'm just trying to embrace sucking and embrace feeling crappy and like when I feel crappy i'll just like go for a run or just do push ups to make it. Even worse, and you know try see where that goes I don't know I don't know if that's going to be like a productive route to take, but for the past few weeks, I feel like it's been working."
148.0,Provider,Okay okay.
10887.0,Patient,"yeah, what do you feel like what do you, what are your thoughts on embracing negative feelings and bad feelings."
148.0,Provider,"Powerful much needed yeah I was just gonna say, and that is something that i've heard you struggle with for a long time now and you're just. As soon as you start to feel something that you don't want to feel something that's uncomfortable for you, you want to just take yourself out of it. You know Bernie brown always says, we cannot choose what feelings we know if you know some you know them all so without the lows you can't really have the highs."
10887.0,Patient,"Right there's no contrast that's Another thing I realized too if i'm always just trying to do things that make me feel good pleasure activities, then like there's no contrast if things."
148.0,Provider,Line right just flat line because you don't. you're not really being you know picking up from. The lows right and without the lows you can't again you can't feel those highs.
10887.0,Patient,yeah.
148.0,Provider,"it's very important to feel that to feel what you're feeling, not only to feel. Like i'm not going to tell you, you need to go feel bad right like does not what i'm getting at, but if that's what's coming across for you, if you're. feeling some pain if you're feeling some sadness if you're feeling resentment, you know, whatever those feelings are. it's important to acknowledge them and to feel them, because without feeling them and having a healthy outlet for them. They just stay stuck buried inside of us until we can't bury anymore right that's what we do we've suppressed so much where we can't suppress anymore, and all of a sudden we're just knocked into everything at once, everything that we're trying to avoid comes up."
10887.0,Patient,"I hear that, so it could that potentially backfire then of just having a hard line attitude towards recovery and says, you know dismissing any kind of bad feelings i'm having could that eventually catch up to me down the road, do you think."
148.0,Provider,"yeah I think so mm hmm it's hard it's hard to just avoid things that we don't want to because again if we're not if we're avoiding we're not really. If we're suppressing and just pushing down those emotions we're not really healing them there's nowhere for them to go. And that's why also sent having an out not just feeling them, but having an outlet like we've talked about journaling we've talked about. Getting support and talking letting it out of us because that's a huge part of our healing even if it's just sitting by yourself and feeling and letting emotion out, you know feeling emotional crying that's actually a really powerful way for us to heal. You know. And some of the messages. That we were programmed, with growing up is you know boys don't cry. You got to be tough, you know, sometimes anger is the only acceptable thing to feel right it's just some some messages. I don't know if. you've ever experienced them but. So it's really coming out of that and embracing the vulnerability and. i'm. Just walking through it instead of. going around it or pushing it aside or pushing it down walk through it. and see what happens."
10887.0,Patient,"Earlier, you said healing emotions, what do you mean by that."
148.0,Provider,"So. When you. So you talked about feeling bad feeling away you don't want to feel and immediately just running from it right, usually using to i'm sure to numb and just to not feel it. That is not how we heal so when we feel upset we want something that's healing for us not to numb to feel it and to work through it to walk through it. Again, it could be journaling it could just be sitting in it and just feeling it and just knowing that this too shall pass I trust my process, you know, things are always working out for me, and this is actually helping me to grow, the way i'm feeling right now is helping me grow. And just finding ourselves that sometimes it's okay to not feel good right we're human I can't wake up today and say i'm never gonna feel sad because I don't want to i'm going to feel sad again in my life, I will I will feel. feelings that I don't want to feel sometimes, and that is okay, because nothing ever last forever right no motion is ever going to be forever."
10887.0,Patient,"You know one thing about that that's also been sticking with me is the I was listening to they were talking about the pain of discipline and the pain of regret, you can either go through the pain of. Dealing with whatever you're going through now the pain of growth, you know or the pain of dealing with cravings and pushing through those negative feelings. or i'm going to be soon possibly dealing with the pain of regret of losing you know, a supervisor position losing my. accurate and losing my apartment you know, and I can't have that I have no time to waste, but so yeah that's one thing too I feel like what you're saying directly relates to that. go through pain."
148.0,Provider,"yeah I know I started talking or showing that talk Bernie browns talk, the call to courage and don't think we ended up finishing in that group but."
10887.0,Patient,I never did no.
148.0,Provider,"yeah she says, if you have netflix you know watch it again because it's really, really good."
10887.0,Patient,Show me the name again or write it down renee brown you said.
148.0,Provider,"yeah the call to courage. But she says in that talk every day I wake up, I my feet hit the floor and I choose courage over comfort. Right, so the next time you're going through something. And you choose comfort first which what would that mean for you comfort would be picking up and using right that's comfortable you know that's what you've done for so long that's what you know right it's what you're used to. If you're doing something that's comfortable for you. i'm concerned. Right that's that's a huge worry if you feel comfortable, what are you doing. Probably an old behavior. What can you to challenge yourself and choose courage today stay sober today to maybe feel a little bit uncomfortable for now and see where that gets you."
10887.0,Patient,yo do something outside my comfort zone. Say go try new activities every day. Go volunteer. I don't know.
148.0,Provider,"You said going to the beach, I mean that's a healthy activity right. you're not using."
10887.0,Patient,"What yeah one thing also that um I found out about this is amazing is there's like this 24 hour 24 seven in a meeting and a.org. And so i've been doing that because you know i've been to add like you know tool set programs even faith based programs and. I the one of the things they say in the 12 steps is do 90 meetings in 90 days, which is kind of difficult if you have a job you know, but because it's so easy just to log on there's always like 100 people on there having a meeting i've been doing it every day for the past two weeks. Thank you, even if it's only for like 1520 minutes I have before I go to sleep like a log on lay in bed and i'm just listening to them, you know and it's. I feel like it's going because it's keeping my mind in recovery thinking about recovery listening to these people's you know sad stories the stories that i've lived in the past and i'm going to live with again in the future if I don't get it right. um I think also what are your thoughts on just being immersed in recovery like in one way or another, every day, I feel like it's necessary like I have to do it, so I don't forget. Or, I need to get like tattoos all over myself about states over something I don't know i've right, I have writings all over my walls about."
148.0,Provider,reminders so.
10887.0,Patient,I might say that you were talking about then 90 meetings in 90 days.
148.0,Provider,"they're not telling you to three four years into recovering do 90 meetings in 90 days right they're telling you that as the beginning of your recovery for a reason and that's because. you're doing a lot of reprogramming you're doing your brain is doing a lot of healing and reprogramming and you're getting into a new routine in your life right. Everything changes everything changes in recovery from what your life look like when you were active in your addiction so. Having that reminder early on in recovery when you're really fragile and doing all this healing and reprogramming and you know kind of retraining your brain is this is my new routine. So it is it's okay to be fully immersed in in recovery it's okay to be selfish in your recovery, those are things that you need to do, the only thing I want to say about that is. don't overwhelm yourself with recovery still take it one day at a time, so it doesn't really matter right now to me it doesn't matter what you do tomorrow it doesn't matter what you do next week matters what you do today. What are you doing today, for your recovery and are you staying sober. And those are two questions you can ask yourself, every day, am I sober today, yes, great what am I doing for my recovery today."
10887.0,Patient,yo i'll be doing it every day for two weeks all.
148.0,Provider,"Simple keep it simple they say that until. stuff keep it simple. We want to keep it simple we don't want to think too much about you know what could happen or. If I need to be this one way in my recovery for the rest, no that's not what we want to do we don't want to think about the rest of our lives or you know just today."
10887.0,Patient,Because that's.
148.0,Provider,coming in that's stressful I don't even want to think about.
10887.0,Patient,"I didn't realize a bomb was telling me i'm my mom's a therapist to she's so knowledgeable but it's like there's so much between us, I feel like a lot of times, she can't connect and tell me things. But she was telling me that and I never heard this if you live in the past that's depression and if you live in in the future it's anxiety."
148.0,Provider,live in today and.
10887.0,Patient,"she's telling me like every day, when you come home she's like a call oh don't sit on the balcony there's like a view the water is just sit there don't do anything. yeah so I guess that's partly all part of what you're saying living today."
148.0,Provider,"So i've seen that quoted by different people, but I think the first place I ever saw that was don Miguel Ruiz, the four agreements such a great book but yeah he talks about you know staying true to yourself staying true to your word not taking things personally i'm. gonna forget the other two agreements, right now, but yeah if you're living in the past, they say that you're living in depression, because you can't change anything that's in your past right. You can't go back and change what's done that's done if you keep going back there you're going to be depressed right you can't do anything about it. Two things are one thing, that in comment about the past and the future is we don't have control over it. The only thing you have control over today is your lifestyle choices that you make today, so what the fear of the unknown all of that that comes up the anxiety around the future. Again, we were not there yet right we can't do anything about it, yet, but what sets us up for our future is our lifestyle choices that we're making today. And that's why they say, if you can just live in the present moment be mindful practice mindfulness every day. pay attention to your present moment that's what mindfulness means right being in the moment paying attention in the moment. You can be content, you can be at peace, because this is something we actually have control over this this moment what you're doing right now, you have control over."
10887.0,Patient,yo.
148.0,Provider,"And sometimes we get. stuck really stuck on things we don't have control over and that's where we need to bring ourselves back to the present moment, maybe practice the serenity prayer. remind ourselves yeah we need we need reminders months okay. So do you want to talk at all about your relapses I know that the last time."
10887.0,Patient,i'll tell you about this lot i'm so good.
148.0,Provider,"yeah the last time I saw you, you had just had one, and that was the only one, I had I known about So do you want to just kind of talk about. Where you've been since that how long ago was so that was when that must have been the beginning of August, because that was right when I was saying bye to the group."
10887.0,Patient,"um so Okay, I did I believe i've had like probably two relapses since that i'm the last one was just like the most frustrating because I had stayed sober. For two weeks before I went to go see my dad San Diego when I took my sister got a plane ticket for us to go hang out for his birthday for a couple days and surprise them like is. Really cool is just an awesome time and then I came back and then went to work and then add a great day working and relapse that night. And like was wrong with me why, like me, ever do is going super great everything's going good I feel really great and instead of coming home I just instantly went to go somewhere where I knew I could get open and started smoking."
148.0,Provider,"You think that oh my gosh things are so good, I feel great I want to feel better."
10887.0,Patient,I guess I don't know I.
148.0,Provider,"feel like there's something in common with your triggers it's they don't necessarily all have to be negative right, I know, big trigger negative emotions, but one thing that I always see you. grabbing I want to feel better I want more."
10887.0,Patient,"yeah. Absolutely and that's the mentality to definitely shake or at least acknowledge and try and work with it. yeah I want to feel better, I want to feel more and just need to shift that whole mentality, you know you don't you're fine right where you're at this is good, because this is where you to learn this is where going to grow just stick with it."
148.0,Provider,mm hmm Have you ever. Really sat down. and thought about or written all of your triggers.
10887.0,Patient,"No, and recently someone did say that you need to identify your trigger situate your your identify your triggers in your high risk situations."
148.0,Provider,Right so.
10887.0,Patient,"No, I have not."
148.0,Provider,"So um. it's a really good exercise i'm. And someone once told me, you should at least have. 25 I think it was 25 triggers."
10887.0,Patient,wow. Let me give you like three or four.
148.0,Provider,"Right right yeah so this could be a really good exercise for you, so what you want to do is sit down and write you know i'd say 20 to 25 triggers and these don't don't think too hard about it, it could be. You know, different emotions that you have it could be people places things think about internal and external triggers right, it could be driving a certain route could be a trigger it could be waking up in the sky is blue a trigger is you know."
10887.0,Patient,yeah.
148.0,Provider,"There there there there and it's important to have this awareness, be aware of what our triggers are and trust me there's a lot more than we think we are triggers."
10887.0,Patient,On me i've been using 20 over 20 years so i'm sure there's probably I probably have 100.
148.0,Provider,"Right right yeah that's why I know probably feels overwhelming when I say 25 but it's really not that many when you start to sit down and write them out um but a really good exercise, and I have, so this is actually a relapse prevention exercise, we have the red dog here. represents our addiction, we have our blue dog here represents our sobriety so what you can do. When you're writing out these triggers you say I know my recovery is when I. feel lonely."
10887.0,Patient,or other my recovery is in trouble when okay. But what is the tf you a.
148.0,Provider,"Okay, so we have a thought of feeling an urge and inaction, these are the. Things that have that unfold when we're feeling triggered right, I know my recovery is in trouble, when I stopped attending na meetings. I know my rechecked recoveries in trouble when i'm isolating. Right like we could do this over and over and over you're. always going to have a thought of feeling and urge and an action when that trigger comes up for you."
10887.0,Patient,gosh you first you think and these happens first that for the trigger first manifest itself as a thought.
148.0,Provider,"Right, so we always have a situation right, we always have something. When that comes up, we have a thought. or thought effects are feeling or urge or action. it's a chain and chain and behaviors here. When I flip over the card, we have empty and a so that's new thoughts new action."
10887.0,Patient,i'm writing this down.
148.0,Provider,"yeah and that's representing our sobriety that's representing the blue dog and so imagine you have a red dog sitting on your shoulder and and blue dog sitting on your shoulder. yeah right which one's going to win well the one that's gonna win most likely it's the one that you feed more guess what. we've been feeding our addiction for a lot longer than our sobriety right now. that's why it's important to really, really be able to identify our triggers what our thoughts are what our feelings are what our urges are and what our actions are. You can even go back and think about your past relapses and say you know what was my trigger what was I thinking what was I feeling what was my urge what did I do. And then flip your card over and say Okay, what is a new thought. what's my new thought when this trigger comes up for me what am I going to do now. New thought would be. I i'm worthy of a better life, I deserve my recovery my new action is going to be to jump on an na meeting. To call bright heart and set up a session to. You know, sit down and maybe Journal and meditate. really do some self care here, because when you're doing this new action that's not going to be going out and using anymore. So make sense."
10887.0,Patient,Absolutely.
148.0,Provider,Okay.
10887.0,Patient,I feel like i'm going to have a whole stack of those index cards.
148.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. This is such such a good relapse prevention exercise, though, and then you have these cards so you know so when a trigger does come up for you like ready for it right grab your card. Tapping it, what do I, what do I do because sometimes the thought so powerful right which dog have i've been feeding more this one. This one's gonna be more powerful right now, what do I do, what do I do flip over the card it's gonna be written out for you, you can just breathe okay not have to go I don't have to do that right."
10887.0,Patient,thanks for that yeah i've never heard of that never seen this that's pretty cool it's a neat tool.
148.0,Provider,"um. Oh, my gosh we're already at two o'clock really um. you're doing really good work, obviously have 14 days sober right now, which is that's huge you know, after a few slips and that's Okay, but that's huge that you've got yourself back on track, are you doing your group with bright heart."
10887.0,Patient,"yeah so I didn't attend those for about a month I did the Tuesday one with Dr O Allah and a lady I can't remember name that starts with an l. Believe i'm and i'm going to do the same one next Tuesday I can't attend it today because I guess you're not allowed to do to being too bright heart and today. For free just log on that's I mean I feel like that's another awesome tool. Right, so it will be using that but yeah i'm going to do, I think tuesday's is gonna be my group most likely, you might go to Monday, sometimes just because my work schedule changes."
148.0,Provider,"Oh OK OK um yeah that sounds good just make sure that just make sure that you're doing something for your country we're covering every day, right now, so today, you know we've talked you can go to meeting you can try and start you know brainstorming some of your triggers. You can always do you know, read the just for today reading something for your recovery um I do want to encourage you to keep doing the meetings right now the na meetings um. Well, and just your self care, you know sleeping eating exercising. journaling whatever self care that you can do for yourself right now."
10887.0,Patient,"One thing I did notice it I just don't want to buy you see if you have any partners to help mom was gave me that little example and that kind of helps you a little bit. But anyway, um I had six days off because they put my suspension and then some other days off together for me to give me a chunk of time off, so I spent that time just eating gaining weight and like. It was great and then, when I go back to work for the past week i've just been so I had such a huge appetite for six days and then now back at work I have zero appetite and i've lost like 10 pounds in the past week and. I just I don't know my appetite is completely gone and the only thing I can think that it possibly is maybe just because of anxiety i've worked in general, like I need to perform. My jobs on the line every day I go in there and it's just like game time, so how, what can I do to navigate around this anxiety to try and get my appetite back because smoking weed is not helping."
148.0,Provider,I would say that if you're having a really hard time eating just make sure that you're getting some nutrients like smoothies chicken broth you know Soups um.
10887.0,Patient,yeah.
148.0,Provider,yeah if you can do that i'm managing anxiety around that that's something you can also talk to your doctor about.
10887.0,Patient,I don't want to take any medication. i'd rather not.
148.0,Provider,"yeah okay okay um. You know, and you did just stop using against it just give your body, a little time to kind of level out and it is really, really normal to have a big appetite after that are you feeling depressed at all."
10887.0,Patient,nope no. yeah mentally i'm actually pretty solid right now.
148.0,Provider,"Okay, are you feeling, really, really excited about sobriety."
10887.0,Patient,me. know I wouldn't say excited but. But I mean I feel driven I feel driven determined i'm highly motivated.
148.0,Provider,"Have you heard of the term, the pink cloud."
10887.0,Patient,"I have, but could you read the definition by me again."
148.0,Provider,"it's like um. I guess i'm excited yeah just oh wow This is great, I really want to be sober and say so you just those feelings around sobriety coming up for you."
10887.0,Patient,yeah you were saying like just super optimistic and almost. Like a an infatuation in the early stages.
148.0,Provider,"Like they call it another term, for it is the honeymoon phase."
10887.0,Patient,yeah there you go.
148.0,Provider,you're kind of feeling that right now.
10887.0,Patient,"I guess maybe. Okay, well, no yeah I don't know. It just sounds society, I think i've you know from I guess it's from work on i'm not exactly sure. But yeah I guess it could just be my body leveling out to you and just readjusting."
148.0,Provider,"Because it's only been a week and your brain doing a lot of work right now. And these early stages of recovery, so I asked i've asked you these questions because it's really typical for for you to go through these different stages and recovery and and just mean it's a good sign it's a good sign, you know, like people always talk about. Having using dreams."
10887.0,Patient,mm hmm.
148.0,Provider,good time.
10887.0,Patient,These days.
148.0,Provider,yeah these things are happening as of your brain healing yeah.
10887.0,Patient,Oh okay.
148.0,Provider,yeah let's see what are any other questions concerns right now.
10887.0,Patient,"Oh that's about it i'll just see I wanted to run the anxiety thing by you and then here I got the you know those the card, I could work with, along with the a renee brown called urge for agreements this 2025 sugars."
148.0,Provider,"Great great. really good work when do you watch that talk i'll give you another one i'm gonna have to. The mask you live in i'm going to have to look it up see if it's still, it was an Amazon time I did have to pay like $4 to watch it, but it is touch a good talk for. For men and kind of what we were talking about earlier just the messages we get you know, in early childhood and growing up and how to break through those so. Let me take a look and see if that's still. On Amazon prime let's get you scheduled."
10887.0,Patient,Last green living.
148.0,Provider,"The math yeah, I guess, I could just give it to you now, and you could look it up, I think it's called the mask you live in. let's see. And how are you feeling about meeting two weeks out. So we won't do a Tuesday, because of your group. Are you still off on Wednesdays."
10887.0,Patient,"i'm not these it's literally been changing every week. I mean this week I have Tuesday Friday off next week, you know if you have a mini I could actually try and look it up. The classical website is down right now actually."
