323.0,Provider,"Okay. What are you hoping in terms of sort of short term, how will you know that you're doing better. with us."
15971.0,Patient,pretty much like. I guess life right now is a struggle so like once everything was in place and things like that and. I don't know stress both little stress targets. Things so I really don't know.
323.0,Provider,"How would, I know, if you like, came to group or an individual session stressed what what what does it actually look like when she stress."
15971.0,Patient,I will talk very often but I don't talk anyways but. You definitely could tell.
323.0,Provider,"So quieter than even usual. yeah Okay, so if you come on to group and you just stay muted, the whole time I probably should check in with you."
15971.0,Patient,"If i'm not like smiling and stuff like that. Because that guy so i'm seeing this my last good, since you like call me like oh."
323.0,Provider,yeah. yeah she even though she's in the background of the groups that I do with her she's watching she's paying attention what's going on. Listening to the topic coming in at the end and sharing you know her own insights and things like that so it's hard to pull anything from around her so that's good.
15971.0,Patient,Like the bad guys.
323.0,Provider,"Right right. When do you recall, when you did your last drug screen with us."
15971.0,Patient,"I did one when I first started in like November 1 back to South that that. didn't get it, so they sent a urine to the like lab here for me to do it. And I haven't. Do it today because there's now do walk ins."
323.0,Provider,"Are you doing it through like quest labs or. Okay, good. yeah I think with them the appointments better anyway, and they have a pretty good system online, to be able to make the appointment. it's just because you don't want to be sitting in a waiting room anyway. Right now, where people might be sick so."
15971.0,Patient,"A lot of people and a lot and i'm not i'm guilty of it because I had those stories to get a couple things, but a lot of people don't have people that can go to store so a lot of people would Kobe have to go to the store buy like. Now, everybody stays in that spreads."
323.0,Provider,"Right right. that's what. really put Amazon way up on the map with people not wanting to go out if, especially those that you'd like you said don't have somebody who's checking in on them, or can do the run for them. yeah then they are going to the grocery store and stuff so. Do you do all like like you guys aren't doing the whole like whole foods kind of perishable foods you do all like regular packaging. yeah product Dr erotics stuff. And is it one of those giant warehouses that it's like football fields long."
15971.0,Patient,"Yes, and four floors hi. Oh yeah it's dramatically bank. Like you. are, I think I those couple days I worked upstairs on the fourth floor it took me 10 minutes just get from the top of the building in the back, all the way to the front that's not even up to my car. So, if you like. In its total gets my car."
323.0,Provider,wow do you do a step counter when you're working.
15971.0,Patient,"um I have my watch. yeah i'm 3000 steps to finding out where i'm at because other places, we have like five people in a station, then we have like a wall behind us to have like little boxes and we get. pretty much liked it a color. yeah color comes up on the wall, then we just go grab all those items scan them then tells us if it's the right item, or if it's over it, and then we package and send them off."
323.0,Provider,it's pretty Incredible though the whole process. Like the whole process of.
15971.0,Patient,"phases me every day and going in there, like we don't even put the labels on it so, how do you know what label goes on what's box to go out. And it's a safety thing, because if people know that they have stuff coming, then they could just show up at their house, so they just package and stuff put like a little i'm scanning sticker on it, and then, once it scans it puts a machine puts the label on it sends it out. Oh."
323.0,Provider,"yeah and even think about that, like a whole nother level of security. yeah somebody see somebody ordering some really cool item and they know where it's going. yeah wow. crazy."
15971.0,Patient,"It is all by a machine. yeah and then we have like these little robots that go underneath our pods then take them all over and, like the pods areas like the link of all floors and it's like so huge at my causes so robots not like Christ and knew each other."
323.0,Provider,Right. I actually have a new client who is. an engineer for the development of those robots which I just think is like like just an incredible mind to even figure that out.
15971.0,Patient,yeah that's a lot.
323.0,Provider,So wow How long have you been with Amazon.
15971.0,Patient,i'm six months now.
323.0,Provider,"Good. Do you have a regular schedule with them, or does it change like per pay period or something like that."
15971.0,Patient,"It was from 630 to six, but now it's 730 to six. Through Thursday."
323.0,Provider,"So, are you at work when you're jumping on for our group, or are you ready at home."
15971.0,Patient,I groups at seven.
323.0,Provider,"So you're just getting home. And yeah Okay, but the wonder you're tired you've just done a whole long day. yeah that's good for us to know so that sometimes that quietness is just. yeah okay. Anything I didn't ask about that I need to know."
15971.0,Patient,No.
323.0,Provider,"Okay. So I just want to remind you obviously group every week see me for individual twice a month. And so, since that right now i'm only doing individuals on Wednesdays and Saturdays what we can't do group and individual on the same day so saturday's are going to be the easiest to for us to stay in touch in terms of individual sessions. What say that again."
15971.0,Patient,At one with you next week.
323.0,Provider,"Okay okay good so then you'll be done for the month, which will be good so because my schedule is pretty restricted right now, I would suggest that you also think about. Sometimes and dates that will work for February and just get it on the books it's easier to sometimes just cancel it or change, you know move it around versus it being booked and then we can always find a time. And then, Dr cell has you I think down for meeting with her at least once a month is that the last conversation that you had with her Okay, we want to get you back into compliance, so that you don't. need to turn and the drug screens once a month, so just because I know that there were some concern with the month going by with no drug screen but you'll have January taken care of so that'll be good. Any questions for me."
15971.0,Patient,No.
323.0,Provider,"Well, I look forward to seeing you in group i'm so glad you're feeling better, but I hear like the fatigue can last for a while, so definitely take it easy. I know you work hard so don't let yourself get too overly exhausted either. Yes, and then i'll look forward to our next individual session to."
15971.0,Patient,alrighty and that'd be next week.
323.0,Provider,"Yes, okay sounds good good to see you."
15971.0,Patient,let's see.
323.0,Provider,"Okay bye. Okay bps appointment with Ashley steals concluded. There is Doc you please document, the discussion about long term and short term treatment goals in terms of the medication management in terms of attendance. and Long term goal, obviously, to. get off of suboxone but not anything currently. short term goal learning some skills and tools for better stress management and remaining abstinent from all illegal substances, so I think we should be good. Thank you."
