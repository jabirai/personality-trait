7441.0,Patient,thursday's. They have it wrong in the computer I don't know why.
165.0,Provider,"Because they haven't. They haven't listed as the old group that you used to do. And so, but I mean, as long as you know, when you're supposed to be there, we can make a note in there, that you know. But you you attended the group last week on Thursday. At. I want to say 11am Eastern standard time Is that correct. Yes, Okay, it says 8am on our end, but I think that's Pacific standard time, let me double check that that's the. timeframe that looks like. And then, so when is the last time that you and then you're taking the buprenorphine suboxone tablets right the eight dash to. You tolerating those okay."
7441.0,Patient,"Oh, my stomach saw her do that yeah. Okay, good, I have to make them the he can't give me the. ones i've been taken because i'm not pregnant and i'm not allergic to milk, though."
165.0,Provider,"Right and then you're making sure that you don't you're not swallowing any of that medication correct. Like like when you take the medication, because we were you and I think you and I were actually supposed to meet and and do the observed dose together. Just so you know if you ingest any of it by swallowing it's not going it's a gun and not work, and then it will also cause upset stomach it usually causes vomiting and najah if any of the if any of the remnants are swallowed."
7441.0,Patient,"i've been doing it that way, for the past year."
165.0,Provider,"doing it or not, allowing it."
7441.0,Patient,"swallowing it every two years, I guess, every doctor that i've been to. has told me."
165.0,Provider,to swallow.
7441.0,Patient,"yeah leave it in your mouth for 15 minutes you know don't swallow or anything just. Right and then and then it's even swishing spit with water when you're done when it when it's like dissolved like you don't want to swallow any of it, it gets if it's not absorbed in the."
165.0,Provider,"In the mouth, like the mucosal cavity is not going to be effective at all, it doesn't work that way. And it also causes it causes that stomach ache so um so I always advise people swish and spit after they're done taking the dose after it's done dissolving so you can make sure to get it out of your out of your mouth and not swallow it. So that might help with your stomach ache and also my helping me, be a little bit more effective to if you're feeling like it's not effective when is the last time that you took a dose of the medication."
