105.0,Provider,Good to meet you.
15835.0,Patient,How we scratch you. pick pop up with you. Thank you. i'm sorry about that.
105.0,Provider,"You need a license to carry that kind of cute around with you in public, that is just."
15835.0,Patient,yeah yeah. yeah I thought my son was cute when he was little but she bought him out of the water she's a she's a cutie yeah. let's give her a fighting chance that's what all this is about.
105.0,Provider,"fighting chance. So they don't I talk a little bit about fighting chance. You. have a chance to provide an environment where her mind is not preoccupied with hyper vigilance worrying if mommy and Daddy will fight. worrying if mommy and Daddy will kill each other worrying if there's going to be food on the table worrying if you're having to move, you know every month, so. It matters what you're doing it matters in the development of our brain. You know we're learning or. That it can affect the development of the brain. And you're gonna you're gonna learn more about it next week to in group i'll talk more about that, but. you're making a difference. It does matter, so the."
15835.0,Patient,"Hard decision I looked up. I looked up online. I looked up online the effects that I have an addict parents have on a kid and it's it's all the things that are wrong with me all the things that are wrong with her mother. Yet all can be route, you know I mean it all routes back to that, I do believe all our problems, you know could have been not all of them, but most of them could have been nipped in the bud with a better upbringing."
105.0,Provider,"There is a strong influence of the Environment there's also an influence of genetics, but that's what how you can change. The outcome by having a supportive environment, so you can have some genetic predisposition for it and interrupt that expression of that genetic predisposition by having good attachment with your caregiver that would be her to you her to her mother. where she gets to just be a kid."
15835.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,So you can change that in the next generation.
15835.0,Patient,"That what yeah exactly I by the time she gets into school, I want to be. have my feet firmly planted on the ground and have all this behind me, so you know she don't have to bounce around from school to school, I want her to be able to go to school, from kindergarten. You know at least middle school high school before we ever move, you know, I would like to stay somewhere, for her whole schooling, but you never know what life's gonna throw at you, but. I would really like you to have them good strong friends that you know you've had your whole life and that's something I never had, and I think that would. it's just a comfort thing, I think."
105.0,Provider,"So, and perhaps today we."
15835.0,Patient,never thought it affected me. Go ahead.
105.0,Provider,"So I was thinking today what we might do is we were doing a lot of sort of. daily living discussions how decisions about where to live and brother and father, we were talking about communication and sort of everyday things. i'm trying to make a decision with this poor connection I don't think I want to take a chance and do anything too in depth, because we've got a poor connection, so I don't want to get into something really. sort of psychoanalytical and then I lose you want to be able to to be here as a guide, as we do that work. So i'd like to with you today because of the constraints of the connection stay up on a sort of a. superficial level around communication skills, we could focus on emotional regulation skills relationships i'm talking maybe with brother or father or with your wife and just give me her name again."
15835.0,Patient,Nicole.
105.0,Provider,Nicole okay so.
15835.0,Patient,Gary GA yeah.
105.0,Provider,yeah so Nicole is her name.
15835.0,Patient,Yes.
105.0,Provider,"All right. Why don't we look at this goal of yours, which is, I want to sort through and accept what is when people lie to me I don't know what that means, but it was something that you said when we first did the bio psychosocial tell me what you mean by that."
15835.0,Patient,"What What was it, what do you mean like. What exactly. Was that did have to do with her what was the question because I know how I know what I mean what's the frame the question was so I don't know how I. Just had to do with people lying to me."
105.0,Provider,"So when we first met I did a bio psychosocial and I said yeah tell me what your goals are and you gave me three or four one was I want a normal, healthy sober life. Another one was I need to stay in contact and have good, healthy communication with dad. And I need to stay in contact and have good, healthy communication with son and then you said, and this is the one I don't understand and you're going to help me. I want to sort through and accept what is when people lie to me, so I can change the goal, but I want to have a better understanding of what you mean, and we can change it."
15835.0,Patient,"Because i've really bad trust. Think that's probably what had to do with is is i've got trust issues my whole life. Like I said I never had that real strong bond with friends, because I mean move so much, and then the times I did have real close girlfriends or anything like that growing up. You know. A lot of them weren't really good people i'm not saying that you know judging them or anything but they want. They didn't have the highest moral, so you know they did lie to me and do stuff by my back and that really messed with me for a long time so i've had trust issues. My whole life and then with her, I finally had somebody and I gave her my complete and total trust, and the same thing happened, as usual, you know what I mean, so I have a real hard time. Trusting somebody like when it comes to. Every time somebody tells me something I go through it in my head and like tell myself okay. it's a lion what are they Why would they lie about that, and you know and that shouldn't be the first thing that goes to my head when somebody tells me something like, why are they lying. You know I mean that's, the first thing that comes to my head is why would they lie about that this way and I tried to figure it out like in the most the time like 80% of the time. A lot of times it's not a lie, you know what I mean so, then I I I stir up a bunch of stuff and it wasn't even alive, but my body's on this defensive thing to her i'm. I just don't want to be the fool that's getting lied to. And then, it comes out later and i'd like to in my head I figure it out before it, you know i'm saying. So, then, I don't look like a fool I guess."
105.0,Provider,it's important if you're talking about.
15835.0,Patient,it's hard to put into words but.
105.0,Provider,That.
15835.0,Patient,I really don't know don't. worry reason I could think that i'm like that is because of my things that's happened to me in my past but.
105.0,Provider,"We see. Through make sense, what is me. Why don't we change the goal, because the sentence itself makes no sense to me it's fine if it makes sense to you, but you didn't say back anything that has any of these words in it. So why don't we change the goal okay. If the if the topic is people."
15835.0,Patient,Like I have to work on my trust.
105.0,Provider,"I have to work on my trust okay work on it, meaning you want more of it. Do you want more."
15835.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah yeah, I would like to trust people but. But did it first more when. When you trust somebody and ends up being a lie, it hurts, a lot more. So I try to pad that bull I think. Just in case it is a lie."
105.0,Provider,So what if what really needs attention is not about the trusting what you're capable of doing maybe what needs the adjustment is your confidence that you will be okay if you're lied to.
15835.0,Patient,That makes sense.
105.0,Provider,"Because there are people that are out there on this planet, you share the planet with and you share this common. relationship as a human being with people that are lied to and they do not feel like a fool. But you do and that's the growth point. So if you had a sense of confidence that you lie to me you don't lie to me it doesn't change how I see myself doesn't change how I feel the inconvenience of I was making decisions based on this information turns out it's this is inconvenient. But i'm not diminished and I don't feel like an idiot there are people on this planet, that are humans that are able to be lied to and they're like well. Then why don't we go to this restaurant that was like well why don't we go, you know they don't get. sad and angry at themselves."
15835.0,Patient,You know.
105.0,Provider,So that might be more of an area for us to see some change is your resilience.
15835.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,Okay.
15835.0,Patient,"yeah my confidence has been ever since all this has happened, my confidence is kinda at a low point for sure."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so I will change it i'm just going to make a little note that we're. changed goal. And the goal is your wording, I want to work on trust issues it's important that it be in your language, because it's something that you relate to is how you kind of conceptualize it and the the small tasks or homework assignments that you do. will be about increasing your resilience and your tolerance. To being lied to. And you'll also be addressing the. thinking that you're doing, because you what you do is you analyze and try to predict. If they're lying to prevent to prevent you from getting hurt."
15835.0,Patient,But.
105.0,Provider,"It takes a lot of time and energy to do that. That time and energy. That time and energy could be going somewhere else, it could be going towards. don't keep apologizing don't keep apologize, so that time and energy. going to playing with your daughter, it could be going to a creative or a professional project it but you're taking those minutes to wonder to scan what are all the different ways that I could be made a fool is taking our energy from your life."
15835.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,And you can pretty easily.
15835.0,Patient,"causes more issues, too, because."
105.0,Provider,Okay hold on.
15835.0,Patient,"That causes more issues, too, because then, sometimes I can go ahead."
105.0,Provider,Okay i'm going to talk for for at least 60 seconds i'm going to be talking so my my question is.
15835.0,Patient,Like gotcha.
105.0,Provider,"So my question is going to be. About jealousy it's going to be about what you do when you are busy analyzing suspecting someone might be telling a. portion of a truth, not the whole truth. i'm going to be asking you as soon as your video comes back i'm gonna be asking you what you do that, you don't like that you're doing. When you're not trusting Nicole, for example. Go ahead."
15835.0,Patient,Like what do I do. Like what I do when i'm not trusting her. it's just hard for me to trust now like because there's been so many lies. Before I trusted her. wholly and completely and I that's what i'm like shame on me and I.
105.0,Provider,Shame on me okay so listen.
15835.0,Patient,don't know.
105.0,Provider,"What i'm asking is. You said today, it causes problems what problems does your mistrust cause."
15835.0,Patient,"I just because when they when they are lying I convinced myself that they are. So there's times when she's not lying and it causes more problems, because I think it's a lie and it's something simple but i've just conditioned myself now to assume that everything is a lie."
105.0,Provider,"So Nathan. Nathan. Tell me only this. What is the problem that I would see with my eyes are here with my ears, because you were missed. Trusting. If there was a witness in your home in your marriage, what would I see what would I hear. What is happening."
15835.0,Patient,Like I can front. Maybe when there's.
105.0,Provider,I can front there we go.
15835.0,Patient,"i'll confront yeah yeah. And I started grill in and or you know i'm wondering and it's it's just causes more stuff that you know, especially if it's not a lie, because then it'll start a whole fight and it'll start it. Just causes more issues than they're already there to be dealt dealt with."
105.0,Provider,"So the difference is what you could do well, let me just ask this question first yes or no is your way working do you end up getting the information that they're lying through grilling."
15835.0,Patient,No ma'am.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so we might agree."
15835.0,Patient,That you know it doesn't work at all.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, good so let's go with that we're going to go with your grilling doesn't work it's not the you know wonder woman had that last oh of truth it's not like you could put a last round and they're going to tell the truth, so we can see that the behavior itself doesn't work. yeah my guest is time works. You watch over time."
15835.0,Patient,It all comes out man can you deal.
105.0,Provider,"But what you can do this different Nathan, that you haven't been doing. is communicating to Nicole, that would be different saying Nicole my mind is racing. trying to find out if what you're saying is true. die feel. afraid. To make decisions. Now what that is is sharing with your partner, how you feel. it's not a behavior request. it's not a threat it's just sharing how you feel."
15835.0,Patient,To. be completely honest and to deal.
105.0,Provider,"It is completely honest kind of deal. it's not intended to manipulate Nicole it's not intended to be a demand on Nicole it's not a behavior request. It is just an opportunity for the nicole's of the world, meaning the rest of the world, your audience people that are listening to you it's a chance for people to care about you. You say it to me if you say to your therapist. i've had about 20 therapists and every single one I always end up talking about themselves and they've even asked me to do things that turned out were unhealthy if you said that to me, and you said and I don't even trust you so much. I might say whoo. wow what's that like to still come here and want help from the very person the profession that has hurt you what is that, like, I would say something like that. I would care. that's me not everybody does that. But it's a start it's a place for you to stop grilling Nicole instead sharing and saying. Each time that it comes up. I know this is inconvenient Nicole, but it's popping up again my mind is racing with different ways to try and protect myself from getting hurt and looking like a full. Do you believe that then Nicole is her. impaired self, which means she's not intoxicated with anything, do you believe she would care that you. were going through something like that."
15835.0,Patient,"Oh yeah we were we were really close when we were both sober and. we've shared some really special times and but, like you know a lot of times it's that stuff takes over and it's. A lot of times I don't know if Nicole i'm dealing with and. And only lies i've caught her in or. Her meeting somebody to get stuff it's never been about relation, you know for cheating on me or nothing like that it's always just been. People she's dealing with or something, because she knows I don't want to deal I don't want her to deal with them, or just stuff like that, but when you're a junkie and you get pressed into a corner you're going to deal with whoever. To get this stuff. You know what i'm saying. yeah so I just need to get her help. She she's got a machine you gotta want it so. So what we're doing I stopped focusing on fixing her yeah."
105.0,Provider,So right now we're talking about you so come back to you this has nothing to do a change in her.
15835.0,Patient,"Yes, ma'am."
105.0,Provider,"assistant with us use this to do with things that you may like about yourself more, and if the goal is for you to have this window of tolerance. grow it's like this it's only a half inch wide now. You really go into a shame activated state when someone plays you for a fool. The goal. is to be able. to realize over time that you can tolerate. Someone lying. And you will be okay. This is unlikely to happen just by talking about it so as much as you and I are talking about it it's not likely to change much until we do an experiential. Until you do experiential exercises. We can do it here together, but again i'm waiting for a better connection, but what you can be doing in your life with Nicole, and anyone is saying. The truth, which is man. You know. feeling like a sucker is coming up for me, you know i'm feeling it like as i'm listening and i'm you know part of me wants to grill you and challenge what you're saying, but I realized I can't control that, and this is really hard i'm having a hard time tonight. I really want to rely on what you're saying. But it's scary so we can start with just sharing it, and then we wait you wait and see what is she going to do. But what we do get to have for sure is you. You move through it without. having to spend hours ruminating having racing thoughts about it and grilling and causing an argument and confronting."
15835.0,Patient,That might be surprised how she reacts to it might you never know.
105.0,Provider,"that's right she worked her more than I thought you know. that's right she might say, oh i'm so sorry, sometimes I have self doubt, and I wonder if people are telling me the truth and it takes up my whole day oh baby i'm so sorry you're going through that no it's true. And then maybe she offers some reassurance, and it works and you might say, Nicole, I know it, but every once in a while, given my childhood, how many times, people have lived. And I have been left feeling so vulnerable I might need to bring it up every once in a while would that be okay, all I want to do is just share it with you and just going to get a sense that that you care."
15835.0,Patient,"Sorry, the winds blow. On about 90 miles an hour out there. yeah I could hear it as tearing through the trees out there."
105.0,Provider,"Would you be. Hello yep, would you be open to doing this change."
15835.0,Patient,Go ahead good.
105.0,Provider,"Would you be open to doing this different behavior versus grilling just to. See how you end up feeling sharing how you. feel instead of showing her. how you feel and the showing comes. In that sort of angry grilling behavior that you do, would you be willing to share feelings."
15835.0,Patient,For sure. yeah oh yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so let me go back in here we've got something to do around that part around trust because really what this is Nathan, you may think. it's something else but it's about your ability to trust yourself that, come what may, you're going to be okay."
15835.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,"As that grows your sense of. As some people live for different reasons I don't know why they do it, I may never learn why he did it why she did it. But I know all the okay. i'm not sure you caught me that."
15835.0,Patient,The very end there.
105.0,Provider,"Okay um. let's move let's move to. um let's move to let me just see something. Where it clear will communicate with others. How he feels. This trusting. guarded. and inhibit reeling and renting behavior. So let's talk a little bit about this goal, you have I need to stay in contact. and have good, healthy communication with dad. What makes communication healthy communication difficult with dad."
15835.0,Patient,"Well before, when I was all strung out I lost contact with everybody for so long. and I don't want that to happen, ever again and then my dad me my dad we can have we've butted heads before the past and he's getting older and I don't want to end up. him something happening to him and. me have to live with you know what I mean, so I, I want to have a good relationship with him, as I can. Even though we have. not bad blood, but a lot of stuff water under the bridge, you know what I mean."
105.0,Provider,"Alright, so see."
15835.0,Patient,he's only thing. Go ahead.
105.0,Provider,"Okay i'm going to talk for a second. um so what we're doing right now is first identifying what gets in the way of healthy communication one thing you said was I was an addict. Now that's history, how is being an addict in the past, how is that getting in the way of healthy communication with him now."
15835.0,Patient,"Back yeah I feel like a. Failure you know, after being so good for so long, you know digging myself out of that pit that I was in and and then here I am. going through the same crap with my other kid and. I don't think he would judge me at all. But. Then again, I don't know you know my little brother he's he does so good and him and dad are just like the spitting image of each other they're like i'm kind of the oddball i'm like the black sheep on the little blonde headed kid and they're both Italian black thick hair like. They look the exact same I don't even look like I fit in the fam and it's like i've always been different."
105.0,Provider,Does your father. Talk about your behavior when you were in active addiction.
15835.0,Patient,"I hate to like go in and because I don't even think he knows where me and Nicole are at you know i've talked to him a few times since all this has happened, but. it's more of a failure issue on my end, I think I just feel like i'm 40 years old and i'm. Just can't get out of this thing right it's like even when I get out of it something's pulling me back down into it it's like."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so you're."
15835.0,Patient,"Using wise, but just."
105.0,Provider,"yeah so you're aware that a big part of it has to do with your shame activation when you're around your dad. Yes, you. I cannot emphasize enough talking about it because it it won't be there, once you say it. you're not going to be making empty promises like you did when you're an addict what you are doing when you're an addict was making empty promises you would say things like this. I promise i'll never do it i'm on the right track now down i'm on the right track, can I borrow, can I just borrow $100. You were making promises is My guess I wasn't there, but, most people do you know what's the differences watch what i'm inviting you to do the same as this thing with the goal is to go in and say dad I got this thing weigh in on me weighs like 1000 pounds on my shoulders it's the shame. That i'm not where I thought I would be. And I don't want to be looked at in your eyes as a piece of shit. It weighs on me so heavily sometimes. I long to text you and call you and have my daughter come over but i'm afraid to look at you, because i'll see i'll see that history. In your eyes. I don't want it anymore. I want to hear from you dad I want to hear what did I do to let you down, I want to hear it, I want it out on the table. So that I don't have to wonder anymore. I want to forgive myself. And I want you to have a chance to say it, and I want to make amends not empty promises, not the bullshit I was doing before I say anything i'm not willing to commit to I just. I just want to hear from you what, how do you feel when you look at me wow do you see me well, how do I look to you, I want to know the truth, because I make up a story anyway. I don't know how much that you heard you've gone in and out on your video a few times here yeah questions about what i'm doing."
15835.0,Patient,"No, no, I got just yeah just be totally honest with them, and I know I know he'll be. excited no you don't because he's messed up and he's done things, and you know, he was a bad he drank a lot, and so I know he's not going to judge me or anything like that I just. You know, you want to make your parents proud and. I just don't feel like. i've done that, but who knows yeah I just need to be honest with him and talk to him, we talk when I when I do talk to him on the phone we talk for an hour or two but it's always. This or that just surface things you know what I mean it's never. I can't remember the last time I had a deep. conversation my dad like feelings and. life and family and. it's always about news, or you surface things you know what I mean. So it's hard for me to get a gist of where he's at but. that's one way, I could find out is by being. honest with him."
105.0,Provider,"Now, have you. Do you think that you're ready to hear it."
