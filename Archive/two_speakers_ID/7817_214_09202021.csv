214.0,Provider,Hello.
7817.0,Patient,Now I can hear you.
214.0,Provider,"hey how are you and i'm sorry for the mix up this morning I apologize, but thanks for coming on."
7817.0,Patient,"that's all right, I almost fell asleep on you there for a minute."
214.0,Provider,yeah I was like let me see if I can run and do something i'm like I bet you should come on as soon as I leave and that's probably what happened. um so um what's no.
7817.0,Patient,"No lot of the newest thing is. uh I found out my mom hasn't been paying the property taxes. And she had all the mail like she was getting everything emailed and she had quit doing that because you know I couldn't help pay the bills when I didn't know what was doing when. So I opened the bill thinking, I was gonna be paying you know part of like the 241 well she's $10,000 behind, and they want it by October 13. So she's not been paying the payment plan and now she's freaking out and saying it's all my fault. And she won't call the play the tax play I can't even know where the papers at now, but she wants me to call and try and talk them into. letting her pay the past four months, that she was supposed to be paying. And now I don't know i'm just glad i've been looking for a place and getting on the waiting list, because this is just becoming too much. And now she's like well i'm not gonna be able to sell the House and i'm not gonna be able to go to Florida and i'm not gonna be able to retire, and you know i'm not gonna get enough on so security and so she's been hiding in her room. And not talking to me. that's aggravating but."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, but. But in. It but it lets you know where you stand not that you know what she's doing is right or wrong i'm not judging it, but like now it's about like what do you need to do for you and your kids right."
7817.0,Patient,yeah. It just kind of puts it more into perspective because you know i've been looking and i'm glad I have and then maybe switching shifts to like it's I think it's gonna happen at the right time.
214.0,Provider,So you know. mysteries things happening. They want and happen.
7817.0,Patient,"You know, and the one job they. It was a grocery store and they were going to give me the position and did the background like always and my charges from back in 2012 they decided not to hire me, but then I got another offer. um. it's like a. it's like a. Train think it's they do all kinds of different stuff in the building, but i'd basically be doing paperwork at night and getting like the rosters ready and stuff so. let's see I don't know that'd be back on third shift again."
214.0,Provider,"I mean not the greatest but I mean we we got to work kind of what we got the other thing too is i'm not going to look to like throw you to the left a little bit, but i'm assuming you either got a misdemeanor or felony in your your background right."
7817.0,Patient,yeah Mr years.
214.0,Provider,How many misdemeanors.
7817.0,Patient,"A four I got them all, at the same time. There it's petty theft unlawful well there's three. Three it's been so long out three petty theft, one of them, so one stated petty theft and then the other two got dropped one to lawful use the property. And then one got dropped, all the way down to a disorderly because it was my husband, the kids his dad time it was my car still I came back to my name so they've dropped that one down because you know, it was my car and the judge said I was just as guilty and I should have known and."
214.0,Provider,"My cell phone. yeah oh. So here's the thing this is early in this discussion, but you can get two of those expunge So if you really only have two you can get rid of them."
7817.0,Patient,I didn't know I could do that.
214.0,Provider,"So 160 59 is the Statute, the Congress passed in. August, for people who need to expunge no more than two felonies and misdemeanors as long as they're not like really severe yours are really petty. I mean yo yo you have to put some money aside for an attorney but the reality is that's something between now whenever you should address as much as possible and it's unfair than. That is against the law right now hi you for but you know what it's probably best anyway because God knows, six months, they would have said hey you gotta go so. Now, how soon, do you to get housing."
7817.0,Patient,"And I was actually going to go stop by there here in a little bit and see because it's hard to catch people online. Because it says online, they have the two bedroom. Two bedroom coming soon in a three bedroom soon, but I don't know how far down if that's with the people on the waiting list or how you know how far diet goes. So I don't know if that coming soon is going to go to five people ahead of me or there's a couple other places, but kind of threw the idea around a little bit to the kids. About possibly going to a different school for a couple months, and so I could get into a place back in lexington they weren't happy, but when I said they get to come back you know, sooner or later than they were. Okay little more willing to listen to me."
214.0,Provider,"So the idea here is it's unfortunate, but you can wait on whether or not the tax collector is going to accept that offer. But the reality is if she falls behind again there's not going to be any negotiation, so you really need to figure out what you need to do now and. If you want to help you mom I you know I support that but I really would support more view she's doing what you guys are doing your own and not worry about who's paying bills and who's not paying bills and stuff like that."
7817.0,Patient,"I was the whole reason I came back was the helper and everything was caught up and I had most of the bills like credits on them, and when she started back to work and started helping and that's when everything started getting all messed up. But to live like cuz i'm. Three four minutes from the edge of the school district so like five minutes down the road rent drops like four or $500 cheaper. it's ridiculous how much it is like there's two bedroom apartments that are smaller they're going for 900 a month right now. And there's smaller than the one I could get a three bedroom for like 575."
214.0,Provider,"Oh, my goodness."
7817.0,Patient,"yeah lexington is not cheap cheap at all I don't get why like even there is a new half double somebody just built down the road, and I call just out of curiosity and it was a two bedroom and they wanted 16 and 25 a month. yeah."
214.0,Provider,wow.
7817.0,Patient,"So that's part like my older son he kind of understands, you know the money part because i'm like if I can't do it, I can't do it, and the one apartment that I used to live in them, you know, on the waiting trend on the waiting list, for they go by your income. So when I was there, the last time, because it can go up to, because I think you know, I think it was 36,000 for a family of four. And then the highest ago is 724 but the last time I was there I was only paying by like 572 or something weird."
214.0,Provider,"All right, I mean listen, you know, sometimes we got to get pushed into a corner and to do what we gotta do, and I think this is kind of the time you sobriety is strong. You know you got employment opportunities, you might as well, stop being on your own and worrying about your own bills, that you can pay and can't pay versus somebody. isn't paying them and then you're like holy crap because I don't know what foreclosures like out there, I don't know how fast, they are I don't even know if they can, if you can pay look I don't know."
7817.0,Patient,"I don't know there's written in the back of the letter and it said something about 60 days. I i'd have to read it again, but because I don't know anything about it either. And then I got to looking at my credit score and that's been starting to drop nothing i'm like I can't do this."
214.0,Provider,"yeah. Okay. Well, I mean it started with Florida, and they started you thinking so now you got to put that thinking into execution and make it happen."
7817.0,Patient,"No, no more thinking."
214.0,Provider,Oh you're you're unfortunately you're you're in the I gotta do States all right so how's the viewport come for you.
7817.0,Patient,that's good.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, no cravings gorgeous. No less than the whole time. i'm um. No, no real stresses, other than the pretty big one right now we just discuss."
7817.0,Patient,"yeah no same thing we're kids they went back today finally so it's a little weird again but i'm just curious how long it's gonna last because they weren't wearing masks other than on the bus when they first they made it eight days, then they shut down for two weeks. And then, now they went back today and a half to wear a mask all day. So they're going to try and stop that and then my in laws are both positive for code right now. So. I don't get along with them, the greatest anyways, but that was kind of a shocker for a minute, because the my mother in law has COPD and asthma."
214.0,Provider,wow.
7817.0,Patient,So she's been coughing you know calling all time and I didn't tell the kids that she was positive don't want them to you know.
214.0,Provider,"have to worry about anything sure I agree, I agree with that. I think a lot on your plate."
7817.0,Patient,yeah a little bit kind of just dumped on me but.
214.0,Provider,"But it looks like I mean listen I I don't want anything dumped on you, but the reality looks like you're strong enough to handle that you're going to do what you gotta do right now. And that's figure out how you can get housing and whether it's on the list or figure out another alternative it just has to get done now there's no there's no thinking about it for months from now it's now."
7817.0,Patient,"Now. yeah and I was kind of thinking about it, too, is because, like if this would have been last year, even before I probably would not be is saying, as I am right now."
214.0,Provider,"I agree it tells us it tells us how clear headed. When we're clear headed if you know when things come up how are we going to hand them what you're going to look like what's it going to feel like. It still feels uncomfortable nobody wants to go through it, it doesn't mean we have to run and do something we're not supposed to and that's just a real good sign for you really. Give yourself some accolades because I know you're doing this pretty much by yourself, but you're handling extremely well and your kids are very fortunate to have a strong mom so now is to show up the employment and then sure have some housing and you know get that moving."
7817.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,um. So we meet on the 27th i'm assuming that's the following Monday.
7817.0,Patient,"yeah. There, that I wanted 11am."
214.0,Provider,i'm going to check this out.
7817.0,Patient,"that's what I wrote down, but no one me I usually write it down earlier, just so I don't forget it."
214.0,Provider,"yeah it is. Let me just make sure that this isn't there right. The other night, you know um. I mean you're coming up you're coming up on a year with us so like he's done a great job just don't let these be a setback right now just push to them and see we can come on the other side. and get this you know to a better place for yourself and mom's gonna kind of have to worry about mom because if you put any money into this. And you still can't pay it and they still come and do what they gotta do all that money won't go for you in the kids right it's like it's rock and a hard place right now."
7817.0,Patient,"yeah that's what I was thinking do, because then she's said something about taking out equity on the House because she only owes like. 50,000 and it appraised for hundred and almost 240 so she and she doesn't have a car, and she was supposed to get a car like I just I can't keep doing everything or I can't. No, no, this making it hard for me, you know, like job wise, because I have to try and work around her schedule and I have to work around naked schedule on it it's like having another kid."
214.0,Provider,I was gonna say yeah and it's not your kid she's supposed to be the mom and doesn't mean you don't want to help it just means you can help both parties you've either got to help. Your existing children and yourself and she's gonna if she needs to refinance she should but that's still going to take a whole bunch of time no one knows it she's going to get approved for that and she's gonna have to come up with money for a refinance anyway.
7817.0,Patient,yeah I think about that yeah so.
214.0,Provider,refinance could be anywhere between two and four grand and that doesn't mean you get in the refinance.
7817.0,Patient,yeah wow yeah she's a bigger mess than I thought.
214.0,Provider,"And and she's she's only taken Peter to pay Paul she's still on the 10 grand and she's still got to keep up with the taxation, so you know I don't want to be a debbie downer on her, but she still has a long way to go, with a lot of responsibilities."
7817.0,Patient,yeah know and one thing I didn't get the other day is. So I did the math because I found whenever receipts so between her alcohol and cigarettes she spends roughly 17 $18 day so around it's like $450 a month she's spending. And she spent money on purpose so she didn't have enough money because the House payment comes out automatic that was part of like the loan that it had to be automatic payments and she purposely spent money to put it right below what she owed so they couldn't take it.
214.0,Provider,"As dangerous. We all know that's dangerous. Information sometimes isn't feeling good like you you've got something good sometimes information is feeling bad and no one. Like now you know where you stand and now you know how bad, it is now, you can make a good decision, so you know with that just to stay strong keep attending groups keep attending individuals. And you know i'll see you on Monday, and if you ever need to talk ahead of time, you could always call the virtual clinic they'll get Ahold of me, but just now be strong and see what you can do about housing. Alright, so i'll See you in group and then i'll see on Monday. Night take care. bye bye."
