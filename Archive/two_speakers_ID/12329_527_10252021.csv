527.0,Provider,You look all cozy with your hoodie on. yeah well how's things going.
12329.0,Patient,"Okay, I guess kind of lukewarm."
527.0,Provider,"Okay okay well so me, and I think you were going to meet up with with the girlfriend the last time we met."
12329.0,Patient,yeah I. was going to.
527.0,Provider,Okay.
12329.0,Patient,"talked about a little bit cold days before like a one I know it's like. yeah I want to see each other. But that or a couple days before we thought it might not have been a good idea. Okay okay that's Okay, I get it. And then. That Saturday comes or the Friday comes she's like oh i'm. All talk to you for anything changes and then the day before comes. On texting. me she doesn't want to hear from me and Saturday comes when we're supposed to meet and she's like Oh, I gave you yesterday to see like if you wanted to respond to see if. I was going so on. So that threw me off, and I was like okay. um no not what I thought. sure. So we don't end up seeing each other from that. And I think we're a little less friendly now i'm not sure if exactly because of that, where if just. You know, things developing sure."
527.0,Provider,"So, so what happened because it sounds like you guys had been talking and then we're going to kind of talk to kind of meet to you know, try to figure out where you guys stand with things so it was kind of my thought was that your thought to or."
12329.0,Patient,yeah that was more or less month up to.
527.0,Provider,Like okay.
12329.0,Patient,"it's figure it out for suits up and i'm. Sure, maybe friendly. um but. yeah construct."
527.0,Provider,So So where are you at with things now Daniel like it sounds like there wasn't maybe clear communication like you're trying to read minds or. She wanted you to read her mind or.
12329.0,Patient,A little bit so i'm not really too sure where i'm at.
527.0,Provider,hey.
12329.0,Patient,i've been taking it day by day pretty much.
527.0,Provider,"Okay, I mean what are your initial thoughts at this point."
12329.0,Patient,"I mean the first part was like serious way, this is probably one of the worst miscommunications."
527.0,Provider,yeah I mean that's what i'm thinking to like where where did that. Like process for you guys that's. yeah.
12329.0,Patient,Well it's something I expected.
527.0,Provider,I mean is that something that she has struggled with before with you as far as like just direct communication or.
12329.0,Patient,Know we've always been pretty good about communication. And stuff like going on talk to me and so.
527.0,Provider,yeah. yeah So do you think there's I mean now we're just kind of guessing like like what the you know which is not a good place to go with things I mean. What are what are you thinking at this point like what do you need for yourself.
12329.0,Patient,"i'm really not sure i've been i've been going day by day and I hear from our last weekend, which you know. try to get together every Saturday to talk. With shields pretty bad. But yeah just on day by day, you know, seeing where things go."
527.0,Provider,"Are you giving yourself kind of a timeframe, or as far as. Like for you to kind of process and figure out where you want to be before you talk with her again or whatever."
12329.0,Patient,"i'm sure about reaching out because I always feel kind of bad about it so kind of leave it to her. reach out a little bit like a son like a link to like an animal thing which I think that. doing a pretty good caper. But personal am not sure I know, like in a couple years if nothing happens, or like in a year, or something if nothing happens, then you know we'll probably like move somewhere or something. But I really don't know like plans, plans."
527.0,Provider,"it's a long time, a year."
12329.0,Patient,yeah I don't know where you like six months so.
527.0,Provider,"Okay. yeah I guess i'm wondering like. You know you putting your life on hold. Like what that's going to do for you like just. Like, how is that I guess my thought is you know how's that going to impact your depression or anxiety symptoms."
12329.0,Patient,"I know it's socially might be the hardest part. But for the pandemic i'm not sure how many excuses of him, he came for being social anyways. slept probably would have been the hardest part. Other than that, you know working and stuffs kept me going was fun than playing games, or like a game online. Okay coworkers school."
527.0,Provider,"Sure sure. Okay. So how how is your depression been with all of this, like because it sounds like it kind of like came sideways here can I hit."
12329.0,Patient,"yeah i'm definitely sucks a lot the fleet doesn't feel amazing. But like we take it in stride, I guess, I really wasn't expecting the world. And I know, like my worst case scenario is you know. Probably not my deal. So I know I got some pretty okay with whatever happens, like i'll be okay with anything it's just coming."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. I guess i'm wondering, for you like. Would it help for you to maybe set some boundaries around there for yourself like. You know, I would like to have a better understanding of you know what what happened, like where where did we miss communicate this last couple weeks or, like you, being able to use your voice and stand up like. And not just have her be in control of the situation."
12329.0,Patient,"yeah. I can see well it's helpful. i'm just not sure if I wanted to be in the position to take action. I can feel it goes on that fucked up once was, you know."
527.0,Provider,"Well yeah that's I mean that's where I don't want you to get stuck there, I guess, I want you to be able to. You know at least be able to have some sort of explanation or understanding for yourself, like you, guys have a significant amount of time together, so I mean it feel like it might be worth. You either getting some closure from her this is, you know she's just not sure how to say i'm i'm done it's over or you know, or if there's something else going on, like. not leaving you just kind of in limbo and beating yourself up."
12329.0,Patient,yeah come open for the same i'm not too sure how to you know phrases.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12329.0,Patient,"I think, after that weekend I was like hey what happened, are we. done now. she's like i'm still not sure how i'm feeling a boat, but you know i'm not giving up. Constantly Samson."
527.0,Provider,"So what would be the next step, do you think for that, though, like if you're not if you're both in the boat of i'm not giving up. Like are we doing, are we taking the steps to make things better."
12329.0,Patient,Most sure.
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah that's what i'm like How long do you want to stay in limbo, I mean because that just really I guess that I mean that just really kind of plays with both of your heads a little bit like not really knowing are we working on things are we not working on things. And i'm sure you've probably apologized over and over to Daniel as far as your actions and."
12329.0,Patient,Your songs.
527.0,Provider,"yeah like. Is she you know, at a point to forgive you for those things and be able to move forward or."
12329.0,Patient,yeah some questions I guess. I got something I wish we talked about yeah.
527.0,Provider,"yeah i'm wondering if it might be helpful for you just to kind of make a list of questions of things that you, you know, would like to. You know, have answered or clarified for yourself. And maybe what your responses are to those same questions, too, so that and then maybe saying you know, can we schedule a time to meet i've got some things I, I want to talk through with you. So that you. Know trying to try to figure out are we on the same page, are we not on the same page."
12329.0,Patient,"yeah I totally thought about it, or like thought about. Writing more stuff down, I always get pretty stuck with like all right what's next. yeah just get really stuck."
527.0,Provider,"Where do you wanna do you want to go through some things today, do you want to kind of jot some things down or. Where do you where do you think you get stuck at."
12329.0,Patient,All no no know i'm just thinking about it.
527.0,Provider,Like just the feelings get overwhelming thinking about it.
12329.0,Patient,"yeah i'm like. Okay, either the feelings are too much all get stuck in like self pity of like Oh, this really sucks everything sucks right now and then i'll just like can be stuck in the feeling."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
12329.0,Patient,Not like enjoy it will kind of enjoy the feeling like i'll never.
527.0,Provider,"Because I deserve this feeling, because I. messed up. How does that help you take the next step forward for yourself."
12329.0,Patient,"mature. It always makes me like it's always what i'm thinking and I always get to me it kind of deeper and thought. Okay, I get to explore it a little more. hello, is just kind of feels so i'm not sure if i'm doing better or worse, you know thinking about it, or you know kind of feeling hurt."
527.0,Provider,"yeah well what's what's when you like, let yourself go a little bit deeper what's the thoughts that start kind of swirling around."
12329.0,Patient,Sorry it's a lot.
527.0,Provider,"It is yeah but I yeah and and I know it is, but I also I want you to feel like you're making some progress, and not just staying. stuck that's yeah I want us to be able to like work through that feeling like be able to let it let it pass and not just keep hanging on to it in a self destructive kind of way. Because you obviously have lots of feelings towards her. yeah. Do you think she understands the amount of emotion, you have towards her for."
12329.0,Patient,A man probably not probably not as much. Especially with like a super text and such. expect to feel as much either.
527.0,Provider,"Well, I think you I mean it sounds like you were just trying to kind of stuff it away. yeah. If you would, if you would see her what would you want to say, first, to her."
12329.0,Patient,not sure. i'm sorry.
527.0,Provider,What do you feel like you're sorry for at this point.
12329.0,Patient,Not being trustworthy.
527.0,Provider,Okay.
12329.0,Patient,very least. for being able to hurt someone so much.
527.0,Provider,"Do you think it would help to just share like what your feelings are with with her at this point like I just need you know, maybe just saying I just need you to know these are my feelings toward you and."
12329.0,Patient,I mean like how many times Can someone here i'm sorry right.
527.0,Provider,"I mean what. yeah uh well and but The thing is, do you feel like she's received it like she's. accepted accepted that i'm sorry."
12329.0,Patient,Maybe sometimes probably not other times.
527.0,Provider,"Okay, so it doesn't. It doesn't feel resolved for you then really. yeah. Which which i'm guessing is what's making part of this hard is that she's not. been real clear on accepting that from you."
12329.0,Patient,And there's not you know too much I can do right now so it's kind of my arms on the back walking forward see what happens.
527.0,Provider,"So what would you show her differently, that she could trust you again."
12329.0,Patient,"i'm honestly not sure. I think, on the surface level is always pretty great pretty good with her for her. So I really don't know how I could you know how do you show that someone have you. know."
527.0,Provider,"Well, how would you be more vulnerable with her. Like as far as like emotionally emotionally with her."
12329.0,Patient,"i'm sure there could be a little bit more, I could open it open up about. You know if we were close enough that. You know that I might hurt a lot. might not be sure exactly where it's from. But that's a lot. it's it's been a lot."
527.0,Provider,"And I think that's you know that's very that's very good with what you just shared to Daniel like you just really let your heart kind of speak to her like. I want, I want to show you how much you know you mean to me and are important to me and and I know that you know i've broken that trust. And I want the opportunity and chance to to build that back with you again. And I want us to have more open conversations and and challenge those feelings, so that I don't just keep them inside. I can have a more honest. connection I guess you know not feel like you have to hide those. Difficult feelings inside with someone. But also her doing the same with you, like you, both being able to support one another in those in that sharing does that make sense. yeah. and obviously I mean you're in urine therapy to working on things, so I mean that's is you know, a way of showing her you know i'm i'm wanting to work through things and feel better to just me personally."
12329.0,Patient,it's a lot.
527.0,Provider,I wonder if it might help just kind of sitting down and writing a letter to her like if that would help just to kind of get the thoughts out and.
12329.0,Patient,Try. yeah like reading a couple things notebook.
527.0,Provider,uh huh.
12329.0,Patient,"No, no. I was gonna last trying to explain things. Other I can't explain how it was feeling or. I explained how i'm feeling now or. Something just. that's been bothering me but it's. Never feels like it's getting to the root it always feels like it's you know kind of just telling a story about me."
527.0,Provider,So what's your story say.
12329.0,Patient,"last one was about my trip to the hospital which sucked a lot too right. That was awesome I wanted to try to write a letter, it was tried writing it was. A lot of emotions."
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
12329.0,Patient,"When I got there, I was like I don't know if I can. I think I wrote a decent amount, but."
527.0,Provider,Where did where did you stop yourself like did you feel like I have to stop now like I can't go any further or.
12329.0,Patient,Just follow what goes along the same thing or what's going on for a while we're. On this to monetizing it.
527.0,Provider,yeah.
12329.0,Patient,It really was no. it's not really an answer for anything.
527.0,Provider,What answer do you think you're looking for.
12329.0,Patient,No idea. i'm not really sure what i'm looking for right now.
527.0,Provider,"What, what do you look for in the relationship is there any any direction that you want to move in your relationship with her."
12329.0,Patient,"i'm not too sure exactly. My head's pretty cluttered emotionally. i'm not. sure exactly what i've been wanting on a relationship. I just know that I really liked being close to them and, like chairing a life almost. Like being close to them physically like holding them and stuff was really nice. yeah just someone to be there."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12329.0,Patient,i'm not too sure what that means.
527.0,Provider,"I mean, is there any part of you questioning like. I maybe want to end this relationship and bryant."
12329.0,Patient,Probably it's been a few months.
527.0,Provider,"I mean, I think it's I mean I think it's certainly again I just you know what, what do you want to be able to say for yourself like even though it's. You know it's her and pain and that you're feeling it's also you know being honest with yourself like Is this a relationship I. I need to be in or Do I need to explore something that's you know i've learned a lot from this experience in relationship and and it's going to help me, you know better, myself and in maybe find a different relationship let's even better, for me, too."
12329.0,Patient,"i've thought about it. i'm. Just really hard. Because sure yeah. Her part wasn't the part but like brown everything it was me. So it's kind of like. I want to like leave that's like me, leaving the situation just kind of running it and leaving. It feels like it's really good before. Like it was on me the bad part. The good part is still there."
527.0,Provider,"I mean, can you forgive yourself at this point, Daniel. yeah cuz I cuz that could be a potential barrier for for you as well, like. Being able to. You know, be more open and honest with her if you're still struggling with being able to you know forgive yourself and move forward yeah."
12329.0,Patient,I think I probably could have. been sad more.
527.0,Provider,"Well, I think it's okay to feel sad but look at how it's gonna you know. How, how will that help me to move forward, like as I work through this sadness. yeah. Because part of it may be just really connecting with okay I I messed up like I you know what was what happened when you know what shifted in the relationship or what shifted that. You know. My needs, you know I saw different needs for myself."
12329.0,Patient,i'm not really sure.
527.0,Provider,yeah okay.
12329.0,Patient,it's really hard to look forward.
527.0,Provider,Has there been any suicidal thoughts or self harm homicidal thoughts through all of this.
12329.0,Patient,"No, just like."
527.0,Provider,Just okay.
12329.0,Patient,"i've been able to handle it better, which is pretty quick us okay."
527.0,Provider,What do you think's helps the most.
12329.0,Patient,mature. stages experiences just going through things. Like obviously whatever I went through at the. Mental hospital there's a lot worse compared to that or i'm sorry that was a lot worse compared to a lot of things so like I can live through a lot. Like that was probably one of the worst emotional experiences any emotional experience that comes after is relatively you know could be worse.
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah That was really traumatizing for you.
12329.0,Patient,So it's pretty yeah yeah. I know I know i'll be fine i'll make it through it's easier to think that now than before.
527.0,Provider,"yeah I mean do you feel like you need to file any sort of like grievance with the hospital for yourself like was it, you know."
12329.0,Patient,"That sounds like a lot of work. um. I don't know is really super annoying situation and total. Especially like signing things that probably wasn't the right state to sign. Okay, or agree to things. Like it's in the past, I just don't want to be done with it, it wasn't like. Anything the people there did it was just a bad time. Maybe my evaluation beforehand, was a little off. I wasn't feeling well."
527.0,Provider,"yeah what What was your hope going, excuse me, going into the hospital what what were what were you hoping for."
12329.0,Patient,"And no idea what it was at all period, or that it was even going. Okay, be honest, for the first couple days I thought it was an escape room."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
12329.0,Patient,Because it was so weirdly laid out and it was almost so tell and I had no context going into it and nobody told me anything yeah.
527.0,Provider,yeah. And that would have been like super helpful i'm guessing is to be like okay here's how things happen in the hospital here's kind of what you should expect and kind of the rules and regulations for the unit and here's how meals were in it sounds like you didn't get any of that yeah.
12329.0,Patient,I was brought in on a stretcher. And was. More or less half asleep because I didn't sleep for like two days. um yeah like the like I don't even remember them telling me about food or schedule or anything yeah.
527.0,Provider,yeah and nobody really even kind of checking in just to see how you are doing it sounds like either.
12329.0,Patient,"I mean I don't know I don't think any but it felt like nobody like talk to each other, along the way. So I just ended up at a hospital marked like mentally encoding or whatever like you know. It was something like disabled."
527.0,Provider,gravely disabled.
12329.0,Patient,"yeah and I. feel like that's, the only thing people read when I came in i'm like. pretty sure i'm not that i'm just."
527.0,Provider,Not.
12329.0,Patient,feeling too hot right now.
527.0,Provider,"yeah i'm so sorry that you experienced that that's very scary it's very scary. And I know every hospitals different and how they manage their Inpatient units i've i've worked on Inpatient units myself in the past and. yeah it's very scary when someone new comes in that's never been in the hospital before like it's very overwhelming and you're not not in the right mind that's obvious while you're there, so you know getting some reassurance that things are going to be okay, while you're there. is helpful. yeah sounds like it didn't have been."
12329.0,Patient,"also described my ADHD. I described as voices in my head, which is not the way to do it, or like do your voices around like I don't know i've like more than one train of thought and they kind of go fast, as I can."
527.0,Provider,yeah. well. yeah definitely.
12329.0,Patient,that's the hard part is. Like knowing it could have been better.
527.0,Provider,which makes it hard to Daniel because you know if if that you know should arise again that you feel like that you know you're going to be less likely to get.
12329.0,Patient,Help like that for slightly.
527.0,Provider,"yeah which is, which is sad, you know."
12329.0,Patient,"Like I can see it were like there were some benefit them like wow, I guess, by the end of it, you know. I did some real work on myself like wow there was a lot of bad, though I don't know if I could do that again."
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
12329.0,Patient,Especially willingly I don't.
527.0,Provider,"And I do I do want to reassure that reassure you, though, Daniel that there are good, there are good hospitals out there. There are."
12329.0,Patient,"I think, knowing it's a hospital first might hope."
527.0,Provider,How was your how was your girlfriend through that process did she.
12329.0,Patient,"told her about everything, like four days before um and then I broke my phone like the day after that's normally. mm hmm and then. I always thought of contact for like two weeks. yeah that was. I think I texted back and was like hey i'm not that, by the way. And she's like I thought you just left like oh no I was actually you know, last."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
12329.0,Patient,We talked a little bit like i'm not trying to kill my slow so it's fine.
527.0,Provider,"So did they allow you any access to phones at all, Daniel. didn't have your cell phone but."
12329.0,Patient,yeah there was like a payphone on the wall. Okay um. And I call my parents few times. But.
527.0,Provider,yeah. What did you need most while you were there that would have been helpful.
12329.0,Patient,really talk now. Someone to say no it's gonna be okay.
527.0,Provider,Sure yeah definitely.
12329.0,Patient,"I guess knowing what's going on. Like when people talk about things like. Like if I talked to like a psychic or sounds like talk to them about what i'm feeling not just like Oh, you have X or y but like. know here like. What you might be feeling and how to combat or like how that comes up or like what might be causing this. yeah even like physiologically pretty big on like my own shit."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12329.0,Patient,But I felt like I was treated like gravely disabled like I don't know what's going on.
527.0,Provider,yeah just yeah.
12329.0,Patient,To himself. doesn't know what's going on doesn't unable to understand a higher level of what's happening. I felt really bad.
527.0,Provider,yeah that did I mean did anybody talk to you like was there any like therapists or nurses or.
12329.0,Patient,yeah there is.
527.0,Provider,Any groups that you did or anything.
12329.0,Patient,"A case worker and a psych. psych was super cool because you super matter of fact, so. yeah going ask the questions good I was like cool yeah. it's like no tell him i'm feeling it's like you don't ever just you know, keep calm and you'll be okay you'll make like thanks."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12329.0,Patient,"Then the caseworker was a lot more, I want to say aggressive i'm like straight up told me like you know i've ADHD. Okay."
527.0,Provider,Okay. Based on.
12329.0,Patient,"I don't know. It was I wasn't there a few times and. they're super helpful. Like that's, the main thing that keeps coming up like wow I don't think I could go to them for like anything. The person I had to talk to, to get out."
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah exactly exactly.
12329.0,Patient,"It actually was a game to me like from day one, because I thought was a game on day one, but then to the end, it was still again once I realized still like I still need to just get at this point."
527.0,Provider,yeah no kidding.
12329.0,Patient,Fellow fellow exhilarating you get out.
527.0,Provider,"yeah well in that you know, but that happens at hospitals to Daniel like it's you know, sometimes it is like what do I have to say, to get out of here like what am what's not being heard, which is horrible like because it's just you know it's not necessarily. You getting what you need from the place either like the support or you know, am I am I getting treated for what is really going on, like Are they really addressing this the depression symptoms with me. Like yes, I have ADHD and I have depression like yeah."
12329.0,Patient,Like depression depression etc it's like after like the nine days or whatever it's like have these things going with like. Well kinda I don't have to do anything so ADHD is out of the picture.
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah not having to focus on any.
12329.0,Patient,Earlier yeah I don't think. refresh i'm not really contacting anybody that's a little bit.
527.0,Provider,yeah. yeah i'm sorry that that experience was.
12329.0,Patient,"really bad timing to. Just because i've never been that low, as always, really big on like wow never been suicidal i've always."
527.0,Provider,been.
12329.0,Patient,pretty good about i've always got something else to do.
527.0,Provider,sure.
12329.0,Patient,"But then I was at my lowest point and cool never been here before what the Fuck am I supposed to do, and then I reach out it's like. I have this didn't really work that much today. yeah yeah and it was really scary wow."
527.0,Provider,Sure yeah so.
12329.0,Patient,"I don't know what the answers are there is the hospital the suicide hotline and i've gone through both. wow that was it right answers. it's really bad. thing like scared for the first time yeah. And realizing that it was like Oh, maybe. Maybe you should have either been working on this before I don't know it almost feels like with mental health, like the too late it's a little too late. Like it doesn't feel like we'll have like the safety nets or whatever yeah."
527.0,Provider,what's your safety nets now.
12329.0,Patient,"that's another scary part i'm not too sure i'm. really like coming to therapy it's pretty cool. it's got my parents, but. My own issues with them. work which. I don't think really could ever be a safe."
527.0,Provider,yeah that's a tough one. Is there anything that you've been doing just kind of personally like do you do you feel like the journaling is helping or any like music or the games like using some of those strategies to cope with things.
12329.0,Patient,yeah and that's what kind of sucks is like I feel like i've done a lot better wow good. yeah. really wish I was doing it like a year ago.
527.0,Provider,"Well Okay, but you know a lot more things right now to like you're you're definitely looking at things in a different perspective. So. Again I you know what can we do to kind of stop that that negative cycle like Okay, I noticed those negative thoughts popping in what you know, are they rational or irrational thoughts like how do I. How do I stop that before they start kind of snowballing into a bigger like i'm here I go down that rabbit hole again so. yeah So do you think it would help to maybe just kind of. Start like identifying what leads to your depression or what's you know what's been."
12329.0,Patient,i'm good a few things. But generally get me in the mindset. yeah I know i've been thinking about them a lot.
527.0,Provider,"So maybe do maybe do some journaling around that and we can talk about the next time and. You know, really kind of delve into you know where those belief systems and thoughts started for you. yeah and I know you I know there's a lot of things with your parents like that. You kind of pushed pushed way down, and I know they're not you know. necessarily the ones that you're going to open up a lot, too, but."
12329.0,Patient,it's nothing crazy they're like good parents and stuff like.
527.0,Provider,yeah.
12329.0,Patient,food on the table and such. So it's hard to be like you know fully emotional like I know my dad's reached out a lot.
527.0,Provider,yeah.
12329.0,Patient,"But then like even like today or last couple days will be like wow it's a really fucking hard day. yeah and like to kind of be at a loss for words. Which like i'm Okay, with it, I get it. I guess I kind of want to something like something to say to like wow it really sucks."
527.0,Provider,Just to even just validate that for you like i'm sorry your days really sucky.
12329.0,Patient,sounds pretty cool.

12329.0,Patient,"yeah definitely feels like talking someone that come in as they're doing a little bit more. Like certainly trying to figure out what's going on. I know there's like a decent amount that you touch on the have worked on a little bit like journaling or writing letters or. You know, thinking about like the root of depression and stuff it's like. yeah i've you know thought about these things, it still hurts a lot i'm not sure how to. get past that point."
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm. helpful okay. What is it that hurts the mouse, do you think when you when we start doing some of these exercises and kind of delving into it."
12329.0,Patient,"I was gonna say I don't know if I have an answer, but every time you ask I just think i'm not good enough, so I think that's the answer."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
12329.0,Patient,yeah I think that might be the root for like a few problems. Probably work and relationships minimum yeah.
527.0,Provider,Okay.
12329.0,Patient,Look wow I really don't feel satisfactory.
527.0,Provider,"So maybe really digging into where that comes from like how that's obviously been there, a long time for you. yeah."
12329.0,Patient,It could be from games i've been playing since I was like what like. kindergarten five years old got that number grind to see bigger numbers on the screen.
527.0,Provider,yeah. what's it what's it like to think that it's that it's been there that long like since you're a little.

527.0,Provider,Well i'm just thinking like it's. Definitely like. You know very introspective like really being able to kind of pinpoint like where I started feeling not good enough like how that played out into where i'm at right now.

527.0,Provider,Why.
12329.0,Patient,"I don't want to because I still play games, I want to feel worthless because or feel like i'm not enough just because I like big number."
527.0,Provider,"OK OK so maybe looking at how why that big number. You know impacts you so much, because I think it is like really looking at like okay that's you know that's something I enjoy how am I going to allow myself to enjoy something, but not just brace myself in the process of it. yeah like that's like. A really mixed message for yourself. Which is kind of where you're at right now with your girlfriend like you know they there. there's a lot of mixed messages going on right now."

Well, good well good work today Dean yeah I know it's hard like really letting yourself be vulnerable with your emotions, but I also know that. You know if we you know kind of push past that superficial place that's that you just you know a lot of us just want to ride right there but. If we don't get down below it really makes it hard to kind of move and heal from what what we've experienced so I appreciate you allowing yourself to be more vulnerable and and work on things and we'll get there, like, I definitely know you're making some progress too so yeah.
