740.0,Provider,"yeah follow them anxiety and depression and things like that barley, called the same tree."

11782.0,Patient,"No, no i'm not. Even show myself why are you thinking like."
740.0,Provider,"Why am I, why are. You thinking like that i'm like you put you i'm saying something your your thought. Your negative think he. puts you more in depression. makes you more and. You got it. Because I gotta fight you gotta fight itself my thing is like if anything can happen. But at the end of the day. Anything can happen, I don't know if you believe in God or not, but at the end of the day, you know i'm saying, everything is in his playing. In his control. So let him, where we back. In here you gotta wear masks let me worry about. You know i'm like you know if they take note off with America tomorrow take care of yourself, but you are ready to miss. Miss. miss you. know. All you can do. Is focus on where you are now. You say well i'm make it through the day and I don't know how is OK, you are a better fit you a better know just be grateful that I made it through today. As are you gotta know how you may sometimes we don't do things in life we don't know how we made it it won't even know how we kept our mind, but at the end of the day. You don't say give thanks to your half hour. by His grace and his mercy and just be thankful that I made it through the day. This is. You know, and in this survey yams and a lot of times. We worry so trying to figure out which I don't know how did they. get our motto. Is the fact that you was able to make it through into overcoat. And everybody has been. dying, and all this kind of so let's listen. i'm sure he's."
11782.0,Patient,yeah. he's healthier than I am.
740.0,Provider,But at the end of the day. we've all sort of say. All you can do. Is appreciate the fact that he's alive today to have a very key. We can think about tomorrow. We just tell.
11782.0,Patient,You I mean.
740.0,Provider,"You just. You got to figure out how MP MP that. The coldness gear were saved. Take it one day at a time. that's necessary. It really, really. Because what happens in there when we get so far into the market, and this week and next month and make beer. That you basically mid mid level. To be able to take in today for what it is because we're too busy thinking about tomorrow, but we have today. So. You have to be able to capture lessons for. today. Like you look at your shoes okay my children do. They help, they just like I told us like they happy, are they happy, you know i'm saying I got a roof over today he. You know they got close on a fake smile, and they jumped around a energetic. Out of kind of best best good thing. And the fact that you constantly. Even though you feel the way you feel the fact that you're constantly. Being a mother to. The children. All you can do is be the best you could possibly be. fancy. And that's what you're doing. With the eyeballs. I love. You i'm saying, because of the end of the day, all you can do we say yesterday. We say you value the crap mumble and I was like what they have today. It wouldn't be much. You know, and the thing about design if we just go based off our feeling you're feeling is not fat. is only temporary. it's not a fad. is only think room, the only time you make it a fact is when. Excuse me, is when your negative thinking attaches to your negative feelings and produces a negative outcome."
11782.0,Patient,Okay.
740.0,Provider,"This one is. This one becomes it. But. Even when a negative feeling, you know that you can change, you can. You can rephrase there and I think I told you before. If you find things to be grateful for. It will lift up. Your spirit I know a lot of times, it can be hard because day today. We find more of. Basically. There today, I think, is, I think I think the way that you. feel and your current. and your current physical, emotional and mental state. Basically overtake. Everything it affects everything. So the things that you could do you won't you don't do because of the fact that you're so. overwhelmed by how you currently feel you know i'm saying is less push you makes you stuff. I don't want to be stuck I want you to come at."
11782.0,Patient,me too.
740.0,Provider,"And sometimes you know, sometimes that takes a little extra fight it takes a little. extra boost. It takes a little. Extra and I know that you don't have extra I know that you feel like you have a question. I know that you feel like I don't have none so again nice i'm just i'm depleted. You know, all I do is wake up in the morning. But the thing about it is. Is there which you wake up in the morning. That you know, sometimes that's enough. To be grateful for. The fact that I woke up. Do you."
11782.0,Patient,don't want to wake up every day and.
740.0,Provider,You don't want to wake up every day.
11782.0,Patient,I just rather be dead. Oh no.
740.0,Provider,I look at it like this.
11782.0,Patient,"If. I am a Christian, so I believe in all that so either there's a heaven but i'll go to that as well, better than this place, or maybe there's an octagon so I just hate him and that's better than this."
740.0,Provider,well.
11782.0,Patient,So either way it's been.
740.0,Provider,"But yeah I mean the thing about it is. The same design is a. A lot of times we. You know, we have to be able to fight."
11782.0,Patient,Past it.
740.0,Provider,"I think you're not and I will say this. You are not the only person in this. world who feel this way right now. you're not the only. Do you know. That it's been way formalization we all have. Our moments. To where we feel like Is it better. To be here, or to be some of those to be from working. With the way that the world is my right now. Live i'm like. Is it better to be here. i'd be somewhere else and. So what I say all that to. say this is that. you're here for a purpose. Even when you don't want to be here it's Okay, because you are here for a purpose. And you're here for a reason. And the thing about it is is they."
11782.0,Patient,You know.
740.0,Provider,"You have to fulfill their purpose. You know i'm saying Ali like I say only you. Only you your half hour no well, I know, one of those."
11782.0,Patient,"purposes, if."
740.0,Provider,"You to be at raising children. Who who gonna be there to get them, just when it's time to go to prom. hold on about it says CFO. You got to meet you gotta. You gotta be you gotta be there. A."
11782.0,Patient,hard time thinking that my kids are going to be a problem and stuff like that. But. If I had to I had to think positively. yeah.
740.0,Provider,"How about you want to read after graduation when I graduate. hold on by the school supplies. You got to take it you got to pay them on. Thursday to Connie. won't be there.

They won't miss me that's a lie. That is a lie. All right, because there is nothing like mobile there's nothing like. there's nothing there."
11782.0,Patient,This is Sam from. Good. Thank you for visiting. Today that's okay. So I was Sam from your. little world and. she's a big part of my anxiety because she's very she's aggressive and she has aggressive behaviors she bites me scratches kicks pulls the air.
740.0,Provider,You know all that fun stuff. Not the fun that's that's part of my. So. How do you because I know you I know you went to school and you study psychology. And you know about. autism do they have occupational therapists. Do they see it occupational therapy.
11782.0,Patient,"They don't have it right now, because we move from Oregon to California so. start the process all over again. Okay yeah they just saw. The doctor the doctor on Friday. So hopefully I said so several weeks, when we get things going again yeah probably several weeks God so i'm hoping by thanksgiving the House aba therapy instance, but I don't I don't know."
740.0,Provider,So how many she goes to school right.
11782.0,Patient,"yeah but she's not there today, she has a really bad costs and with coven they don't let any kind of symptoms come come to school."
740.0,Provider,"Right So how do they how do they recommend her at school, when. She does biting and kicking and pulling about that, what do they do."
11782.0,Patient,"Thankfully they don't did I have not seen those behaviors from her. This is all whole thing. yeah it's usually jealousy when I haven't via whatever siblings or frustration and sometimes I don't know what it is bored and tired I don't know, but she just starts winding herself up and. gets to the point where she's Yankee my error, and you know pulling she's attacked gave twice yesterday a. You know so it's not just me it's also other to issue."
740.0,Provider,So.
11782.0,Patient,um.
740.0,Provider,"What about decide, are you a. Are you well. When is it when is your insurance. When is it kicking. To where you can actually be able to get. Other resources."
11782.0,Patient,"It might be several weeks we just saw the doctor on Friday so he's waiting on reports from the teachers and when she gets reports to the teachers and he can write his report and then his report gets presented to a committee to be approved it's it's ridiculous. And then, once they do that and that will get assigned to a person, though, hopefully by thanksgiving."
740.0,Provider,Okay. Did you tell him.
11782.0,Patient,about her it's ridiculous. need to tell them by attention. You know I don't think I don't think I did stupidly I think I completely forgot we've got so involved in other stuff so I was thinking of calling his Secretary today leave us a message yeah.
740.0,Provider,"yeah maybe you should do that because what that does is you never know have them. A expedite the process. Especially because of the fact that she poses a threat to her siblings. imposes. forth posed to you as well, because I mean it's a violent behavior. And if you're not in Charlotte and they have not able to control it, and she finds herself out of control and abusing her siblings biting and punching and fighting and taking input by those type of thing you know i'm saying. Yet needs to be discussed so they can. Then, whoever the documentary is can basically tell you how to how to do it properly. And then seeing if there's possibly a way to expedite the process. To be able to give some kind of hit."
11782.0,Patient,again.
740.0,Provider,So maybe.
11782.0,Patient,You want to get off.
740.0,Provider,"get off the session, then you can actually call them and let her know. or. The key points see if she can patch you through. To to the doctor and say hey. that everything was was a lot of commotion last week. We want to let you know of the behaviors that she's meeting deepening. Lately, you know the harmful behavior sure assuming it was worth."
11782.0,Patient,Okay.
740.0,Provider,"cuz. I mean. yeah those type of things that it has to be. It has to be addressed you know i'm saying, because a lot of times. With this type of behavior. You know i'm saying like we, I have a nice in law, who hears you. For I think she's. Four, and she has autism. And so, she has those she has those same. type of thing, and so you have to be able to address it, and then because of the stakes, you know of course you never want to add to the episode. Because, of course, you know i'm saying it will. Basically, increase their rage. But at the same time, you do have to address it. You see, have to address it when I used to work with autism and children once upon a time and they used to do behaviors like that, then we will have to you have to figure out basically how they respond that she responds a physical test. This season does she respond to the growth of. The through strong aggressive. recommend vocal reprimand like How does she. respond and so basically has ever she responds to disappoint you i'm saying, then that's how you have to do it like we would have to. Like I had one key once upon a time, and he would do different things, but I will have to say, bad hands bad hands band, and he knew what they mean. And like when he would do that he would take you're saying that. i'm saying that he put his hand suicide, because you have to be able to and inside, you know this, because you went to school for this, but it is more so, you know i'm saying. And maybe you can turn more of your attention on this. That are there to help you ease your mind with the other stuff you got going on, but basically implement an instructor and a discipline. When I say this, my my my physical discipline i'm talking about structure in regards to so that she can understand something that's. A routine something that's you know something that's of interest, so that she can understand me. You know, things like that, even with some children some children, my response a physicist, so the point to where they saw it, as you know, like you assess their risk like this."
11782.0,Patient,and be like no.
740.0,Provider,You know stuff like that.
11782.0,Patient,You know you just.
740.0,Provider,"I mean you know it is, however, she. respond, I have a she responds. To to discipline to make her. stop doing that behavior because she needs to understand as a behavior is bad behavior. If she doesn't understand that is bad behavior this you gotta keep doing it."
11782.0,Patient,yeah for sure.
740.0,Provider,"So yeah see that's something they can occupy your time. That way, you can get your mind off. day you will be trying to figure out. How to get something out of it, because the thing about it is. You never wanted to do it in the wrong place to the wrong person."
11782.0,Patient,Right.
740.0,Provider,"i'm saying so that's. that's always you know cuz. Man talk about a team and. If it because you already said, you know why she does it, you said she doesn't because of the fact that if she ever gets jealous that should give them more attention to her siblings over her. or she's bored or you know i'm saying or she's frustrated about something that she responded so that means you already know. What the triggering events are they will call us to respond it so now basically you have to learn her. What she needs to do what you have to do to make her stop."
11782.0,Patient,and
740.0,Provider,"The undecided their behavior their behavior. Because. I mean they feel I mean they're still able to function and. Then you know they are low function like that, but they're still."
11782.0,Patient,able to function.
740.0,Provider,"If they can function to school, they can function."
11782.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,yeah so you can you can turn your attention towards that of how to get her to. Have if we have to respond to. To. To basically basically if we were ways that you can get her to stop so she can understand know that bad behavior bad behavior you have says she can understand the different. So yeah. Now you got something to work on.
11782.0,Patient,Great waste my daughter to attack me now.
740.0,Provider,"No. No, you don't wait for her to attack you. Know know what you you ain't tryin her if you try and her now. yeah you try her name. Was teasing base yeah i'm like no don't wait another few. years. Now you sure how NASA that."
11782.0,Patient,She wanted.
740.0,Provider,"me they have them all God. know. That way. yeah we want to. We want to prevent the tape trust me I understand I used to work in a minute, they have feel in those type of I used to work in. And those type of group home type setting. And I remember one time, when I. never knew that I may have something. And I see you have to keep this around is open, I think I do something one time and I ended up getting hit. Like she hit me so hard, I have to remember that I was an employee. And so. The index, but we end the moment I have to correct their behavior. You i'm saying, and you can only correct the how they receive correction. If you're saying it's how it's how they receive it. Because. If you realize now. That, if she doesn't receive vocal reprimand like that and she's not going to stop I like I said with vision lady I had you know. I have to always keep her with me, I had to really I had a deeper with me. If she wants to leave she wants, and I was like no and so then she keep my hand and then I had, and then I had looked at her, and I said no. You don't see me. So. yeah but i'm going to shoot at me. again. Sure, David so."
11782.0,Patient,"that's good. I were to group homes for many years, also and adults with you know mental illness and stuff it is it that I did it was easier and what my life is now. That was easy this."
740.0,Provider,yeah it's easier to make because you get to go home you ain't gotta live with the people.
11782.0,Patient,yeah yeah. True true true.
740.0,Provider,"yeah it's always easy when. You do it because you get it, you get a start time and stop time. y'all have to see him on wiki is or how does that. With the is this yeah you know i'm saying. yeah as far as when is your key. And know, maybe. Maybe there's something that you. can focus more on to the candidates are you a kind of distract. You from the other things you're failing. This may be something that you can focus on. Just basically how that just a different. Different. or proper. The proper way to help."
11782.0,Patient,manage.
740.0,Provider,manage to do with with autism. It doing it doing the tantrums. And then all the episodes. so that you can know what to do. And they're doing gotta sit there and take it.
11782.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,that's a good that's a good distraction distraction.
11782.0,Patient,yeah it's true yeah.
740.0,Provider,"Because. Even when she came in the room, your face. I feel. Even when she turned around your face do."

11782.0,Patient,Nothing is not enough.
740.0,Provider,"That may have not worked at all, then I helped me is not."
11782.0,Patient,"Helping at all. doesn't seem to be. Sure, to raise my lithium, which is supposed to help with suicide ideation. So we'll see if that works, but when I talked to her a couple weeks ago she mentioned. Possibly passing it on to somebody who marks bit more experience because. She doesn't know what to do next with me. So. She hasn't met yet, though. Can you understand me okay."
740.0,Provider,yeah okay.
11782.0,Patient,He says you haven't done that yet though okay. yeah yeah just up to the Sam. So we'll see.

Getting the adequate service that you need. And measures period so sometimes if people feel like you know what i'm not. My expertise don't even extend the bar, you know i'm saying it's a good thing when someone, and I know you can take it as a bad thing, like all should give it up like no it's a good thing when someone says hey. i'm not qualified enough and I meet this person I mean you have to be transferred to someone who's more qualified because. A lot of times. A lot of times, firstly, you i'm saying in certain situations, if someone feels like they're. Not qualified enough, and they do you more harm than good. or they tried everything they possibly could try it is still not working, they yeah Why would I continue. To try to do something, it is not here. And you when someone else. may be can provide you the actual proper treatment that you need. And can make you a better, it is about your bedroom is. It has nothing to do with. Always she told me, I was somebody oh. No it's about your bedroom it because the end of the day. We want you to keep living does anything."
11782.0,Patient,We want you to do issue. yeah and if she were to pass it on to somebody else does that mean I go to a different group and everything.
740.0,Provider,"Oh no. Oh no because. I have i'm scared i'm feeling like me. You know i'm only i'm only about a bottom. A little wavy and but after that a whole lot to learn. with how the ins and outs of how it goes but i'm not really sure. Because I have people in our group, all the time that's not on my caseload so I don't know. But. Yes, so I think I don't know, I guess, because if the providers different maybe maybe not. I don't know. But we'll cross that bridge when we get there. We there yet so we'll cross when we get a. lot of them. Other than that. I want you like, I said to make. I want you to make sure that you are very. sensitive to how you feel aware of what you're feeling and that if you feel like you need to go to the hospital make sure that you open your mouth."
