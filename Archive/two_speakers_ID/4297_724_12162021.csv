4297.0,Patient,Not much just taking a walk. yeah. what's up.
724.0,Provider,what's new and exciting.
4297.0,Patient,"i'm. Not much really. they're not shit on just kind of tripping balls about. My dad's birthday tomorrow. and obviously goodness my girls birthday on the 19th. But I was just been tripping sorry has been driven fucking balls. about my dad's birthday and if we're supposed to like do anything for or whatever. So I called my brother pile and I are texting and was like hey do you know we're doing start walking home, you should. Say hey do you know if we're doing anything for dad's birthday and then anyway, he called me like yeah. I don't know I don't know what we're doing. If anything at all. Would you be down for me to pick you up tomorrow. To go to dad's House like if I if he if kyle said if he's feeling up to it, I said yeah. But then, towards the end of the phone call I told him I was like man, it would be dope if. If we just ask that, if we could like pick a day to celebrate his birthday when Tracy is not there, so we can all three hang out. and not have to deal with Tracy is like yeah that's a good idea. So, like Okay, do I. Call dad and. Do I call him tonight and ask about it or do I call him tomorrow and he's like don't trip about a dude i'll get back to you in a couple hours. And that kind of use my anxiety and he was like honestly bro Fuck that he was like half the time he doesn't even remember to give us a phone call on our birthdays. let alone a gift, so I don't know why you're tripping so fucking hard over the first day. Like yeah so good point. yeah. Oh, but I still feel like I still am, I still feel bad."
724.0,Provider,What do you feel bad about.
4297.0,Patient,"I feel I think i'm feeling bad because he's getting older he's getting older and yeah just getting older and i'm afraid that. i'm gonna look back on this year and be like Fuck I wish I had. not been since you've been sacked up and went. went to his house, no matter what was going down."
724.0,Provider,"you're having those. Those epiphanies now you don't have to wait. wait till your old. Now. You could start increasing your you know your interactions there you know what i've been trying to get out of your comfort zone, but I also feel that is. problematic for you so. You know, without beating yourself up you know I mean who's to say that you're going to be. A better relationship with him in the future, you know things could. Things could always get worse, you know what I mean so yeah. I mean your main complaint is it's the girlfriend right. And I doubt very much that you're going to be able to pull him away on his birthday from his girlfriend so I mean if you guys want to do, like a bro hangout day it's gonna be. Another day, maybe, maybe on the weekend, or something like that I should be like kidnapped him on his birthday, for her you know it's probably. she's probably yeah that's for and stuff like that, so you know, without having to put him in a position that where he has to tell you what you already know just be like we're thinking, maybe on Sunday, or something like that or sometime next week. yeah we all have free time that we all just go do a quick, you know. Father son hang you know if that'd be cool see if he's up to and then you know, like if he's not you know, then you know shame on him, for you know they're making you guys feel secondary to everything else so as long as you try and. Put the effort. You know if the outcome is positive cool if the outcome is negative cool you know you still tried you don't have it so."
4297.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,don't try too much about it.
4297.0,Patient,"True, it I don't know I also use kind of feel weird about it as well, because he my dad hasn't really like even sent me a text and probably about a week and a half, almost two weeks now and then he just texted me today a couple YouTube links. Like nothing happened. And yeah I I just replied no like damn. cool little sent me a video on. This like little this little metal engine for like $36 super tiny, and you can like build it and whatnot. And then he sent me a YouTube video on how F1 cars engines work and whatnot. Oh cool yeah he's big into Easter what's it called. Fuck you work on a lot of shit he used to work on helicopters and airplanes. yeah he knows a lot of shit about when it comes to engines."
724.0,Provider,"Okay, so there's a gearhead."
4297.0,Patient,"yeah he his last job was building the submarines that go down hell, if I can do. To help clean up oil spills and just other kinds of underwater life bullshit. yeah it was a place called schilling robotics. And you know it's like little. Like little middle clamp arms that they have on the summary. yeah anyways there's a little station where the guy was. Testing it out and he was fucking with cans and shit like picking them up and crushing them, you know, and he let me have a go on it, and obviously there's just a little fucking joystick you can move around. So I. picked up the can brought it to me brought it back squished it. Is cold who's like holy shit your kids natural anyway to think that same day, they had a client coming in to look. Why his a $6 million signs in their in their pool out back it's like to give like 120 feet deep and like 90 feet wide. Well anyways my dad and I are up in the little control room watching it and the owner was flying it and he looks at me says hey you want to fly it and without skipping a heartbeat I was like yeah. yeah my dad just looked at me like better not fucking crash or I lose my job, and I have to pay $6 million my friend. yeah he's smells like we. To this day, he still he still tell that story like I don't know why the Fuck or how the day let you fly and I didn't get to but hundreds grateful you didn't smash."
724.0,Provider,awesome here's our work there anymore.
4297.0,Patient,"Workers COMP like last 20 years. are running into my Harry Potter. Thank you. yeah. And one of the craziest shit. On par. YouTube link and send it to you, but um. yeah it was crazy awesome your YouTube link you worked on a flying car he helped are you actually created like the smallest engine with the most horsepower output, or some bullshit like that, at the time I was like a eight pound engine in something like 169. Horses or some bullshit like that. But. I remember, they had the. The prototype at all, they had it all set up on this like basically crane thing, so if it did go up flying and fucking drop it would just hang by the crane in case you drop and. That was, I think they'll either close to my birthday, or as close to Christmas, because he was like. yeah this thing goes up in the air and flies we're gonna go to the skateboard shop, you can all pick out like a skateboard and. If it was."
724.0,Provider,Nice.
4297.0,Patient,"yeah so it's just a weird. Like thinking about all the different shift that my dad's worked on and then just thinking of him, like as my dad like he does not seem that fucking smart."
724.0,Provider,"Well, sometimes people have like that, like an aptitude for. You know. mechanical engineering and."
4297.0,Patient,science.
724.0,Provider,"math and all that kind of stuff with their social skills are terrible you know what I mean like it's almost kind of like like a balancing act it's like they can't have too much a soft and like. i'm sure you know who ilan musk is right. Yes, yeah you know the Dudes like super genius with socially awkward. yeah if he wasn't awkward and he he was a genius and so you were like it's a was good looking like it would it would it be fair to the rest of the world, so it's like a checks and balances and like that it just has to be that way. Smart as he is he's got like earplugs you know so it's like this. yeah so can be the same thing with your dad you know I mean anytime you meet somebody who's got like a. it's not like it, I call it like a weird intelligence, because I don't have it so it's weird today. Seen musical artistic math based sites where they just understand things that like a much deeper level than like people could really ever get to so it's probably a little bit of that you know I mean. there's probably a lot of that actually. Being smart can only get you so far, and then, like the rest of it like you to learn that, through like social cues and if you can't pick that stuff up that is this weird so."
4297.0,Patient,yeah for real.
724.0,Provider,So what else has been cracking with yeah.
4297.0,Patient,"um I fell back into my depressive sleep schedule for the last I want to say three or four days, maybe yeah three or four days. Yesterday I slept two. For the day before I slept till 7:30pm."
724.0,Provider,"Though and contacts, though, so you slept that late what time you go to bed."
4297.0,Patient,"Probably about. Five or 6am. see what the beds about 12 hours sleep, I think."
724.0,Provider,So why are you going to bed that night.
4297.0,Patient,"Because i've been waking waking up super late and then i've asked so i've been waking up late and that's been throwing me off of my i'm taking my daughter Pam on schedule, so when I wake up. Again with john hardest shit from the. opiate. Right and then i'm slightly entering benzo withdrawal."
724.0,Provider,not good.
4297.0,Patient,"yeah not good, and then I yeah in the last few days i've. been sleeping and then, when I wake up i've been waiting like two to three hours to take my medicine to I guess trying to punish myself for what i'm not sure."
724.0,Provider,how's that working out for you.
4297.0,Patient,"not good. As well as not eating. Until I feel like i'm dying. And then, all start eating. As it's not working out good."
724.0,Provider,So what like what set you off because because you're you're pulling back on. yeah on a lot of things you're you're behind on your surveys here which isn't like you know you miss that appointment that which isn't likely so Is this still stemming from the desktop that you had with the girlfriend. or your dad's girlfriend or.
4297.0,Patient,"What others think it. I think it's. My dad's girlfriend. You know kind of tripping about my dad's birthday. But then again since i've talked to kyle the whole he never fucking calls you on your birthday, so why, why are you tripping about hanging out like give them a call that i'm sure you won't even answer."
724.0,Provider,"you're trying to be the be the better person you're trying to go tit for tat you know what I mean this is your dad doesn't. contact you on your birthday doesn't mean that you shouldn't do that, out of like out of spite you're still. Trying to be a better person, so you should punish yourself for that you know what I mean like you could be like out of the out of the why bother but. i'm going to do it anyways because i'm still a good person, you know what I mean like but you don't have to punish yourself for doing a good thing and that's kind of."
4297.0,Patient,"And then i'm like like we talked about before of trippin about not being able to buy Bailey a guest, and I, you know I talked to her about that, I think, last night, and the night before, and she told me I just write me a letter. write me a letter and just hang out with me. that's All I want all our bond was, like all right, I understand, but it still still feel like a piece of shit. blah blah blah."
724.0,Provider,what's your what's your financial situation I don't know.
4297.0,Patient,fucking broke I haven't worked in three years. yeah I don't work in three years.
724.0,Provider,"What did we. What did you do. starbucks okay. what's stopping you from employment, right now, is it the paid."
4297.0,Patient,I would say. My anxiety and pain as well.
724.0,Provider,"And they're probably pretty closely connected right, so what like when you deal with product pay and, like the like the metal the rest that it puts you on. it's like it's chronic you know what I mean like so I understand that."
4297.0,Patient,yeah i'm still finding all that chronic pain bullshit out my myself and. yeah.
724.0,Provider,"It can be very debilitating. Okay, so you've been out of the work day for for three years what's do you get any. Disability ratings, you have a heavy stream of income, nothing."
4297.0,Patient,"Not moment. Use me was all i'm supposed to be trying to i'm supposed to be filing for disability or whatever. So I can start getting like seven or $800 a month or some bullshit like that. But i'm having a hard time accepting that I need to be on it. Because I know that it will cut my work hours down to only 20 hours a week, if."
724.0,Provider,you're not working at all anyway so.
4297.0,Patient,yeah. yeah.
724.0,Provider,"yeah i'm like so. So what is better than nobody and you could always come off with a disability right, you know what I mean like if you get to a point in life, where you're like i'm solid and I can work 40 hours a week now. You can come off of that so it's not it's not a perverted things that have to be. Right yeah so so it's resistance that stopping you for filling out this paperwork."
4297.0,Patient,resistance and. procrastinate procrastination.
724.0,Provider,yeah that there are mutually exclusive yeah okay. Do you need help filling out the form or.
4297.0,Patient,"Not. um yeah I guess my my mother in law would be able to fill it out, for me, I guess she has a lot of experience, filling out these kind of applications and. getting them getting them through on the first try and. That kind of shit. and"
724.0,Provider,What have you asked her to help you.
4297.0,Patient,"that's a good question. I don't know, I have a really hard time talking to we we just have a really hard time communicating with each other. it's almost like we don't want to step on each other's toes. it's a it's a weird dynamic over with over here with with mother in law as well. yeah. yeah. I get that plan. Going in motion."
724.0,Provider,"And maybe you know, maybe asking her for help, would. would alleviate some of that weirdness that you guys might have between each other. Like where where is the accountability come from. Between you two."
4297.0,Patient,"So for me it started when I moved to Florida, and I moved in. Her her son is my age and he is. he's on the spectrum he's hardcore autistic. And within the first like two or three weeks. I said I said us he makes noises fucking constantly and is constantly stemming. I didn't understand any of that bullshit when I first moved in and I made a stupid remark, or something along lines of damn he sounds like he's getting horny over that food and she kind of like. got pissed off at me. She got pissed off at me and Brett probably rightfully so. And then she like bought her first car by herself and. And I was, I remember during the day I was in a really bad like depressive slump and Bailey was like hey you could you just come out to the garage and and and say like nice that's awesome car. And paint I forget what I said, but I was just like. Nice. And then she got super pissed off that I wasn't like over the moon happy for her. And ever since then I just felt afraid of saying the wrong thing in front of her. But like I have her take me to the pharmacy to grab my excuse me to grab my refills or go to the smoke shop to grab whatever and. Like it's a little awkward like. Asking but then like once we get in the car and like start getting going somewhere. Like we usually start talking and whatnot and it goes pretty smooth and then. it's I think it's I think it's we both have a lot of anxiety problems. So yeah I think it's just the initial starting of the conversation that it's hard for both of us. man."
724.0,Provider,yeah I could see where he probably got off on a bad foot. where's where's her song now.
4297.0,Patient,In the room next door. yeah unfortunately they would. they're trying to find a place to send them to. But I don't know shit about that it's a yeah.
724.0,Provider,it's difficult.
4297.0,Patient,I can't even imagine yeah.
724.0,Provider,"well. If I if I presented opportunity for you guys to move past that stuff if you, you know if you reach out to her and ask and i'm sure she's aware of what the situation is with you. Maybe she's is waiting for you to ask her nose."
4297.0,Patient,True.
724.0,Provider,"spoken to her unless you feel like you can do it yourself, you know, the end of that."
4297.0,Patient,I can fucking call and find a GP at the moment. yeah.
724.0,Provider,What what's the.
4297.0,Patient,General practitioner.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, so like our primary care."
4297.0,Patient,"Yes, Sir yeah."
724.0,Provider,Do you. want me to help you find primary care.
4297.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,Or is it a matter of like you calling is the problem.
4297.0,Patient,I think it's a matter of me calling is yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, so you feel anxious on the phone with or."
4297.0,Patient,um. yeah.
724.0,Provider,Oh yeah well I can't call for you.
4297.0,Patient,yeah I know I know. yeah. i'll hit up Bailey and be like hey can we set aside a day or we can you know make some phone calls and just sit on my pipeline me you tell me what to say or write something down.
724.0,Provider,"So So how do you do this, how do you do these video sessions. I felt I felt like these must be more like a about it, these are more stressful the beginning calling somebody on the phone was it difficult for you to get to like the video conferencing."
4297.0,Patient,Oh God yeah it was. It was horrendous. But I was yeah.
724.0,Provider,Because you're like a pro now so like like I would have never thought that.
4297.0,Patient,"Literally my first like group meeting with bright heart health. So it was my first meeting it was probably two years and some months ago. It was Dr Dr Allah Dag so it was like three or four doctors ago Dr Alan Dagens arena, as the therapist serena beers last name was beers be E R s money. anyways elevating. In the Group chat and I think she made like a breakout room and pulled me to to the side and was like hey Eric, I just wanted to let you know that the rules of the group are innovating and no smoking. No consuming weed or anything like that she didn't really know me or anything at the time, so she was like just reading the basic rules, just like no raping no smoking cigarettes, you know consuming drugs know showing up on drugs. And I was like oh I just broke down like i'm so fucking sorry I had no idea that I wasn't allowed to fail and I just had like a fat panic attack. There to like it's all good it's all good trip me before that you know the rules. Arielle smoking back in my old. I didn't but I was thinking."
724.0,Provider,"Yes, sometimes like sometimes things have to be. You know marginally I don't know. Sometimes you gotta get lacks with some things to get like a better to achieve a better outcome. that's always been like my approach to things things like offend other people like by now like, we would know about it, you know I mean."
4297.0,Patient,Excuse me. geez he. So yeah like I feel like if our our cussing was out of hand and I feel like Dr grows or somebody else in the group would have spoken up by now.
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah I mean I bet in just across like you know across the board and groups where things were they seem like super unprofessional and it for like lay people on the outside of like, why is it. Like let them talk like that and it's like because that's how they express themselves. i'm not going to come there and micromanage their their thought process because that's the opposite of what we're trying to do here. You know you don't want to restrict people and. You know, and then put them in a box and then expect them to do all these great things, but they have like really like like thought police them like. Like you can't you just can't do that you're going to communicate with people like at their level. And if that's what makes them comfortable then cool, but it cannot be, of course, can't be the expense of somebody else so like obviously like. You know people were getting crazy that you could tell it was affecting other people like are you going to settle down right but little things like that it's. yeah."
4297.0,Patient,"yeah bright heart, I was going to tell. You chuck at the beginning of the meeting I was gonna say, can you so you kept your ball cap on it makes you feel more comfortable."
724.0,Provider,yeah yeah little things.
4297.0,Patient,Like i'm talking to my point my cousin.
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah I always felt like like like the hat thing was like for me that they came out of like a weird place on it was like on like a. Like on Fridays, my first counseling gig like I worked in like the like a work release an all female work release was upstairs but, on the first floor it was. A therapeutic community, so it was nine months. Like a nine month Inpatient program and I would have to go to the jail, to pick people up that we're going to be new to the program so I physically get the Van and like. going to the jails and escort them out do that kind of stuff and I started picking people up on Fridays Fridays was like a dress down day so be like jeans the company sure, and I would wear ball CAP like he's out in Florida baseball is like a big thing in Tampa. Like the socks in the Tampa Bay rays so there's like that little competition so. There are a lot of like transplant style there for like New England and New York and all that kind of stuff so it was always like a point of like prize, so I was really a red SOx hat. And it's literally just the letter b on it so it's not like offensive at any will do what it was so I remember picking up patience and then one day. Like I picked up patient so we're essentially going to be like my clients and. You know what they saw me like that, like the following Monday, they were like I didn't know who you were you know that, like they were super comfortable with me, like, for whatever reason, and if I felt like like that the handling was like you know. Coming out of jail, they didn't really know what to expect."
4297.0,Patient,Like.
724.0,Provider,"yeah and then somebody like me who looks like that that talks like them a little bit they instantly were more comfortable they were just like Okay, and I felt like like, if I could decrease people's anxiety just by."
4297.0,Patient,My appearances aggressiveness yeah.
724.0,Provider,"yeah you know what was huge so it just became like this thing and then people would just got really comfortable and obviously I love where it had so that weren't all the time. It just became the thing of every job that I had ever since that like I always wore a hat, because it was it was like that ice break i'd be like guys that were like sports fans that. you're going to be like calls you like the red SOx are the pages and it automatically we already like establish like like a dynamic where we're like."
4297.0,Patient,All right now we can.
724.0,Provider,"Get you know some places, will like it. And it is what it is it one of my last gigs like after a year of being like that being that guy and. somebody who i'd even work with like it was offended by the fact that I was wearing a hat like a semi professional setting like I know the residential program where it's like. You know, like i'm there on Sundays on my off time all kinds of sudden it was like really that's that's the thing that's going to bother you, but I don't think it's that happen that ball is like."
4297.0,Patient,yeah I think it's something else.
724.0,Provider,"It started out so it probably was you know it probably was so I was like Okay, as soon as you do, like I don't complain about your orange fingernails or. Your earrings or your spray painted hear anything like like yeah you're. right about that."
4297.0,Patient,Much fucking perfume or yeah. Like I bet remember yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Be be who you are, and if that makes people comfortable or uncomfortable and deal with it, but you know not at my expense, so what is."
4297.0,Patient,Real. Well i'm a request by heart health. Lets you wear a hat when you meet with me because it eases my anxiety more.
724.0,Provider,"Perfect yeah that was like the solutions like lots of people's problems were like alright cool. So I like. It worked out pretty well because I actually shaved my head like over the summer, like nobody do so what like like I actually got away with it, so it was like. it's good that the hat work bag, is there, like a. Like I look awful to shave though that's for sure so."
4297.0,Patient,same yeah I shaved my head shaved my head and think through 2016 excuse me her hair is like down here.

4297.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Like, I guess, like, I guess, if you have here it's okay to not shave it all now it's weird."

724.0,Provider,and maintain.
4297.0,Patient,hundred percent.

4297.0,Patient,cool.

That was dominance and do like those little tricks on but so far he's been he's been pretty good when we're still housebreaking you. The freedom is like yeah you know by eight weeks like will have housebroken don't don't know German commands or French commands whatever you want we're like oh sure cool yeah no not at all."
4297.0,Patient,Unless you're putting in the work to do it.

724.0,Provider,"or anything so it's been pretty good we set up like our Christmas lights. For really like the first week that he was here or our first week we took my side put on the Teller and literally the tv's off the ground and we just put up Christmas lights of. Cars right by the street people coming by and he just come right up next to us and, like hanging out, you know it is very protective and it's like it's what I wanted like and I wanted to visit my girlfriend hope so."
4297.0,Patient,"yeah so damn cool I was watching a video yesterday and. dude had, I think I don't know the exact fried but anyways like anytime he would cross the street like dude would cross the street, the dog would like lay down. And even if he caught, even if the owner, called the dog, he would he would not move, and he would only like get up once his owner came back and cross the street. So, like he basically trained into never cross the street, unless you just like right by a side."
724.0,Provider,"So Nice. that's cool smart yeah yeah you guys spent a lot of time. Like if you find dogs that have like high intelligence, you can you can train them to do a lot of things should have to put in like a lot, a lot of time like he."
4297.0,Patient,cannot hours.
724.0,Provider,"You can't be. Like never Hall, you know, like this type of dog would not do well, like if I if I physically had to go to work someplace if she and I oh God no you'd be fun there's no way that dog would. go crazy, you know what I mean like we're."
4297.0,Patient,yeah. I mean just.
724.0,Provider,A good just your.
4297.0,Patient,"Training just potty training and even. Teaching my lab how to how to sit on command was pretty fucking hard, I can imagine. With your breed."
724.0,Provider,yeah so. yeah so it's it's it's been interesting it's been interesting but i'll grab it before we close out so you.
4297.0,Patient,know.
724.0,Provider,"Normally, like like this time of night, you know up to me like upstairs doing these sessions and stuff like that, but she's upstairs with it now, because if he was down here heard maybe start barking and stuff so. Try to keep them quiet, it is midnight so it's like can't be going bananas at this time, a time in the night so. yeah. But i'm grabbing a few minutes, so do you want to work on. Getting primary care like I can help you do you know kind of navigate that a little bit. We could talk about doing the you know we'll ask the doctor if he's good at do disability that I would ask her if she if she knows how to do it right, then I would definitely ask her. And I want to like focus on like like improving like your self worth because I know, like a lot of your anxiety comes from that so maybe work on that a little bit sounds like a good idea."
4297.0,Patient,yeah definitely.
724.0,Provider,"Well then, i'll come up with some some like like interventions. To address like the self worth and then we'll go from there with that and that the the the PCP that week we can get that resolved in like a session."
4297.0,Patient,"house, I thought you're talking about PCP as like you got some Bowling."
724.0,Provider,"No, no, primary care physician."
4297.0,Patient,That we're talking about Fen cycling I got excited.
724.0,Provider,"No, no, that stuff is good for your chemistry. Oh Okay, so we can work on that. you've got to do your surveys man, Dr roses she's a stickler for these things. You are behind so."
4297.0,Patient,"Do should I do to have the like to have each of them, or just."
724.0,Provider,i'm not sure how it works like like if you're behind like. Are they dated or is it just a survey that is there when you log in.
4297.0,Patient,I would assume that he did be.
724.0,Provider,"Because i've had patients be like yeah i'm all caught up I did all that and it's like. I don't know if that means that that when they logged in into the email there was like a bunch of things that were there and then they just. You know, clear about or if it's, just like the same things that are always there no matter like if you do and what you don't do they're just constantly there so i'm not really sure no."
4297.0,Patient,i'm pretty sure it's just the band setting the pH Q nine and there might be another.
724.0,Provider,"survey yeah it's like the band seven the gad seven, which is the anxiety, one of the php that this is saying that your patients satisfactory surveys overdue to so let's let's do quarterly so let's do every three months. It says need to complete pain measure survey either complete weekly chronic pain survey, so you might have like a bunch of surveys outside of like the basic theories."
4297.0,Patient,"You can just log in if you see things like that, if you see him."
724.0,Provider,There and they're just dual right. yeah and then your your uds.
4297.0,Patient,What was the last time what's up with that because Dr groves said that I was on quarterly. But then I asked her if I could still beat monthly so I. Would.
724.0,Provider,You want to help me.
4297.0,Patient,have seen be more accountable and still have that oh Fuck like if I want to if I feel like relaxing like I still have to be like Fuck I still have to make a clean piss test at the end of the month.
724.0,Provider,"I can do that. And lastly, any health mental health any any thoughts of self harm self injury. Days."
4297.0,Patient,"No, no, no, suicidal thoughts. No okay."
724.0,Provider,they'll play as though attaches.
4297.0,Patient,"No, no, no, I very much want to live. yeah."
724.0,Provider,Let me see here.
4297.0,Patient,This looks a little less pain.
724.0,Provider,"course you know you're on both of you talk screens so let's see. Was shipped out on October 28 So do you have a urinalysis cup like in a box. Around someplace new house okay you're going to want to do that, like tomorrow, because if you go past."
4297.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
724.0,Provider,"it's over 28 that you're gonna have to go in person, so. You know if you could do all that stuff get your surveys caught up do all that stuff by tomorrow that will look really good on paper for for us for you, for all of everybody involved."
4297.0,Patient,Dr i'll definitely do that i've just been slacking the Fuck off in.
724.0,Provider,"yeah it was certainly yeah you last survey was practically 30 days ago, so you have it's like. But. You know, for the for the people on the inside, like a general idea what's going on with you right so. you've had some interesting family dynamics and I still think you should probably like lean into like the advice that we all gave you last week about. Maintaining your distance for both parties, for the time being, just so you gotta focus on yourself, because they seem to be like the root cause of a lot of your concerns so. You know, helping try to avoid it. Alright, so. Let me make an appointment for you. Our second point for the ball real quick. And then. What is it about yourself worth that you want to regain like what's the angle."
4297.0,Patient,"To not. Always view myself so negatively. As well as I guess. Men minimizing negative self talk. That, I think, would help."
724.0,Provider,"Have you have you tried to that general thing to you about putting all your negative thoughts on paper, before you go to bed to kind of clear your mind."
4297.0,Patient,"To be honest, I haven't. backer. For real, but I think I might try that."
724.0,Provider,"I think it would be. I think it would be an easy. routine to like kind of factor, and if you did you know every every other day, maybe you know the start. So that way you're not just like you know conditioning yourself every night be like Okay, I need to write down, like all the shitty things I think about all day I mean like it. yeah it's a double edged sword, you know what I mean so it's like when you're writing up dobie like here's the things that i've thought, these are things that i've resolved in order to be have have the pros and cons to they'll just be like it's all bad. He didn't want to wake up to a piece of paper that says all bad right, so you know hadn't had the slot today and then what you did about it, you know how did you dress it out of your check it out of the corrected. Things like that, because you want to see like an outcome right you don't want to just be like you know I you know I hate the way why my hair. falls over out to one side of the boat people are curly and it's just like. You do anything about it, if you get a straight hurry, that you should you know what I mean so it's like. yeah kind of like that it's a dumb example but it's just like."
4297.0,Patient,Not work.
724.0,Provider,"You know, whatever it is like, how can you how can you correct it like. What would like. put in place to avoid having to write the same issue down every night or every other night."
4297.0,Patient,"yeah all right, not that definitely makes sense."
724.0,Provider,do this.
4297.0,Patient,super random but I don't know why every day and every night I always just feel like i'm fucking doing something wrong like.
724.0,Provider,He was feeling guilty.
4297.0,Patient,yeah we feel guilty.
724.0,Provider,Because you've set a task that you complete for the night.
4297.0,Patient,"You have something I think that every day like. i'll tell myself like. I say when I go to bed, and tomorrow i'm gonna wake up take my medicine eat some food and i'm going to pick up my guitar and play for at least five minutes. And then i'll get up and do some other shit and then think about not playing yeah."
724.0,Provider,"So already you've identified. You know, certain hang ups that you are a certain goals that you set for yourself for the day and you don't fall through and then at the end of the night you're reminded of those things that you feel like not accomplish now that's your self worth, so I think I think for you man. I think journaling is it's really going to help you because it's going to make those things real and make those tasks real on paper and then, when you get the check those boxes off at the end of the night. you're going to feel better about yourself you're going to be like okay I didn't completely waste my entire day did I. do everything that I had set out to do, no but I got half done, you know 50% is pretty good it's good start or 25% better than like no percent right, so you have to have like reasonable metrics for measurement so on top of. You know, a top of journaling some negative thoughts that you had before bed just to kind of like clear the air. Why don't you make like on one call of like your negative thoughts on the other, column what you want to do the following day. You know tasks that you had to have to get accomplished like I need to get on and start working on his disability shit I need to get on. It start looking for primary care, I need to pick up the guitar and play for 30 minutes I need to do eruption on by Van halen because, if I don't have would it feel like total dirt bag, you know."
4297.0,Patient,Like these little.
724.0,Provider,"At the other night as you're writing down your negative consequences, maybe start off by checking off the things that you did do that see if your negative. thoughts are correlated to the things that you didn't do so maybe that's what it is maybe you're bored task orientated and you're just not getting stuff done and you're feeling like crap about it. You know, we can start connecting dots you know what I mean you got to put stuff on paper because it'll make more sense when you do it that way, as opposed to just hear one sided conversation suck man, especially with yourself. Because they don't have been solved right, you know, like trust me like like you need to you're not ready to talk about it with somebody or. or any anybody, other than yourself that you got to put it on paper because that's that's what's going to make it real that's what makes thoughts reels we have thoughts millions of thoughts every day all day long but they only become real with you either say it out loud here like oops. Or you put it on paper either way you have to make it real first and then you can start addressing it because, if not that it's it's going to get cycled through with all the other stuff that's going on all the other noise."
4297.0,Patient,for real.
724.0,Provider,So.
4297.0,Patient,I definitely you start fucking during.
724.0,Provider,quit slack.
