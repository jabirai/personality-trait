324.0,Provider,What about now.
8684.0,Patient,yep yep.
324.0,Provider,Actually.
8684.0,Patient,"I got something I got something going on with my computer to where half of. My meetings are going through my monitor speakers and half of my meetings are going through the actual computer speakers and I have given up trying to figure out what is going on, because if I try and mess, with it, then it cuts out all the sound. Right."
324.0,Provider,Eventually i'll move on to our booth. For I know I didn't have a passion. And I really want to work.
8684.0,Patient,yeah I just got my office moved out of my dining room into a spare bedroom so. Because i'm working from home too so i'm glad I finally actually have a diner back.
324.0,Provider,Or how are things going.
8684.0,Patient,"they're going pretty good i'm i'm trying to think I remember the last time we talked most of my drama with my former friend who's kind of i'm doing pretty good handle and all that it was a little interesting, I had a birthday Party last weekend. And it was with my friend who remains close friends with that person. um so luckily he called me first and he had like a big birthday party dinner type deal and then he chartered a fishing boat the next day, and he asked me what I wanted to do, and first and I told him i'm not going on a boat to go fishing so. I went out to dinner and then he took the other person with a group of people out fishing. So it was nice of him to do that, but I was had a bunch of anxiety all week because I was thinking I didn't know when they're going fishing and I was worried, it was that day and that they get drunk and he just told me to come along to dinner anyway. But um luckily that didn't happen. So that worked out well. i'm quite a bit anxiety from it, but. It worked out. And so that's good that's done and over with and that whole situation is a lot better. pretty much everybody is just to the point where. They know I don't want to hear about him I don't want to see him, and no one really brings them up anymore."
324.0,Provider,"cuz I should respect that because he was a boundary. yeah absolutely hit every right to it, the way that you felt been in the field."
8684.0,Patient,"Well, and then I mean also I still think how they treated me afterwards was."
324.0,Provider,Worse than what they did.
8684.0,Patient,"Though I mean that's kind of the huge problem and I don't I still think they don't understand that it's like. You know, but um yeah so kind of just plugging along."
324.0,Provider,yeah I mean.
8684.0,Patient,"Unfortunately, one of my good friends, who has been battling brain cancer took a turn he took a turn for the worst at the beginning of the month, I don't know. I think it's been that happened after we last talked so. that's kind of not too fun so kind of take yeah taking that one as it comes and. I don't know exactly how bad, it is, but he just started um they're now doing, like the daily chemo infusions so I know it's not good when it gets to that point. So."
324.0,Provider,we're going to have surgery.
8684.0,Patient,"So he's been battling it for about six or seven years um, so I think it was i'm 30 now I think he got it, it might be eight years because I want to say. No nine, because he got it before he started working at PG or right as he started working at pg&e so when he was 21 he started having a limp they couldn't figure it out and ended up doing an MRI and he had a big brain tumor. And they got removed, he did chemo and he was cancer free, for I want to say about well, this was the start of all my problems is about three months before all the shit went down with my former friend. His his brain cancer came back he got. His MRI came back with two new tumors um and so he's been back on chemo for about the last year and a half now and then, three weeks ago he woke up and because he's always had problems with the left side of his body from that tumor. He woke up and like his left arm was completely numb like he had like no use of it and so went to the doctor all that sort of thing and they got him on some steroids, so he can move his arm again this wall, the swelling down but. The cancer is still a big problem and it's not getting better so. yeah. yeah yeah, and I mean so young, because he, like I said he was 21 when he first got it. So. that's been my new fun, one that i've been dealing with."
324.0,Provider,My prayers for. Your family and.
8684.0,Patient,"yeah that's what we've we've just been trying to hang out, you know, trying to get dinner, because I mean you can't do a whole lot and especially with coven and being on chemo has to be pretty cautious so. we're just trying to kind of do what we can do."
324.0,Provider,You being a great. You know. People they are within. You know. support them either.
8684.0,Patient,yeah that's what i'm trying to make sure to check in on and but it's also like. not be too intrusive because I know he has so many doctors appointments going on right now it's pretty crazy.
324.0,Provider,"When. We get when I looked at the scheduling i'm like today, good day so, then I remember i'm like let me double check your Unluckily."
8684.0,Patient,"yeah. I do the. First, Tuesday of every month."
324.0,Provider,Well we're happy we're changing able to. revert back. So. It looks like. i'm looking. At sleeping.
8684.0,Patient,"So i'm actually doing fairly good on sleeping and last time I talked to Julie must been probably about two weeks ago. I mentioned that I was taking benadryl like three or four times a week to try and get to sleep at night, and she said, I should really try not and i've been not using it it's been i've been doing all right. um so that's doing pretty good eating it's pretty good anxiety it just it's weird obviously the whole situation with my friend's birthday that had me quite a bit anxiety throughout the week because every time I think about it be. Oh shit my former friends, going to be there that's not going to be good. But, and then it seems like most of the time though my anxiety comes if i'm getting if i'm going out like if i'm going out for dinner with a group of people. Or if i'm going to go out to a concert with a group of people that during the day before that happens. I just get like really nervous about like oh we're not going to go out Oh, the show is going to get canceled like somehow the evening isn't going to go as planned um and that's typically when I get anxiety, the rest, the rest of the time i'm normally fine."
324.0,Provider,"and I think there's term but i'm calling it in toward and. anticipating the future, you know."
8684.0,Patient,"Exactly, I think, whenever i'm going to do something that I see is fun with a group of people, I start thinking about it, not working out the way it should and that's where it seems like most of my anxiety comes from."
324.0,Provider,Another last one what network August 11.
8684.0,Patient,That sounds. that's still what i'm on correctly.
324.0,Provider,and have that.
8684.0,Patient,"I mean it's. it's not I mean I can definitely tell it's not what the vibrant is because I mean I can feel vibrant. Like just kind of keeping me calm and then I think it helped more with anxiety as well. But at the same point, all the other benefits of not taking vibrant are really nice. um so it I guess it's kind of a trade off."
324.0,Provider,Great but it's not it's not an emphasis on.
8684.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah the hope because I was originally on lexapro. And then we switched to vibrant because it was supposed to have less sexual side effects, and it was better, but not really. to the point where I could do anything. What was that."
324.0,Provider,To see what. Her thoughts are on that one. is turned on. to it.
8684.0,Patient,Okay.
324.0,Provider,How can we help. With anxiety. and depression like it is are. there. But also less chance of the sexual side.
8684.0,Patient,Okay.
324.0,Provider,"As you know. As an option, but it would like to play on Friday. Is is is less likely to have the south central sun is on."
8684.0,Patient,Okay.
324.0,Provider,You know. What.
8684.0,Patient,"I mean. yeah I need to do that. I need to give that office a call and see when my next appointment is I don't think we set one up, but it should be coming up pretty soon we're doing those every three months. It seems like I met him. In July yeah so it's. But that things, it would be nice, I mean what I have actually got really good is like the whole breathing stuff like what I feel when I start getting anxiety I just really try and do like the deep slow breaths deal. And that seems to help, but in public that's not exactly what I want to be doing."
324.0,Provider,Right.
8684.0,Patient,"that's my primary care physician. My psychiatrist is Dr Guild. And he's in the same like St Joseph group, but he is out of Santa Rosa rather than your Riga."
324.0,Provider,Okay. anytime you have an outside.
8684.0,Patient,Okay.
324.0,Provider,"As far as seeing me, and I think is pretty much the same. Outside therapists. Checking in with me quarterly. file so. Okay that'll work perfect. You know. Maybe. your thoughts are. On the Teller on. Those. machines."
8684.0,Patient,"Well, that was that was the same thing with the vibrated it was pretty pricey and what I actually found is when I when i'm sure that turn into Alex has the same thing I went to the vibrant site. And if you fill out a bunch of forms and send them in they'll end up giving you like a discount card through the company. And they ended up, I mean it's still pricey, but it was a lot more reasonable day because I think my insurance paid 10% of the vibrant cost, but then that card thing would pay 50% of the remaining cost. So I was only left with about 45% of the cost, which was a whole lot more reasonable. yeah yeah. Luckily that's one part of my life that's going alright is a financial so."
324.0,Provider,army bareness bonds.
8684.0,Patient,"um I would say, more than I would like, but still extremely minimal um I would say a couple times the past couple months. So. not really an issue my whole thing is that. I would, I know that the girl that I want as a long term relationship is not going to like that. So in general i'm I mean granted my party is way roped in compared last summer, but. it's still I mean i'm trying to cut down for my personal self I don't think there's any sort of addiction issues going on."
324.0,Provider,What are we talking about when I wanna.
8684.0,Patient,"No, no, all I all I do is alcohol and cocaine."
324.0,Provider,"And as long as. I want to be aware. that's why I always ask you know, are going to be aware of. You know how much. How much are you frequently for but it's not."
8684.0,Patient,"Oh. Totally and then what i've actually done, I guess that's relevant is um I use significant Lee less than like what I was using last summer, when I do use so. I would say. A quarter of what. I used to go through so."
324.0,Provider,You ever go through legal I will draw.
8684.0,Patient,"Now, no. I mean, because I think it's so infrequent because it's always when I do do it it's for one night like if we all go out to a big concert or something so it's literally, for you know four hours or so, and then I don't do it again for a month six weeks. So not that not the smartest life decision but not. In my opinion, not really an addiction issue."
324.0,Provider,how's your. mood at any point. Any loans or self harm.
8684.0,Patient,"No. I mean the hangover suck but. In general, my moods been pretty pretty good even even when most of my depression right now is due to my friend, with his cancer um and even when I get in a pretty crappy mood I can actually look from like outside and be like well you know stop not morning to kill myself like I was. Eight months ago, so it's like I can tell i'm in a shitty mood but. it's not like shitty shitty."
324.0,Provider,So I don't. want to change. Quarterly. What i'll do is have been in are you in our our. Projects on file change.
8684.0,Patient,Okay.
324.0,Provider,Good i'm glad to see. Doing so much better than me. yeah you work for retirement.
8684.0,Patient,"Well, that that's what i've gained all the weight back because I typically stay in really good shape and i'd lost I think like 25 or 30 pounds during the whole like probably over a two month period. So I and also, I do party less than I did use than I used to and it's easier to work out when you're not hanging over."
324.0,Provider,yeah you. know. This. Is brighter so. Much. Better.
8684.0,Patient,"yeah Thank you me, too."
324.0,Provider,So what we'll do is. Around December ish.
