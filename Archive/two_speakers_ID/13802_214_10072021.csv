13802.0,Patient,"Well i've been feeling kind of down lately. And I feel like they weren't really helping the dose that she had given me, so I started taking 200. And it seems like that's been getting me a little bit more a little better, you know. And then, since right now i'm going to school to go to school for two weeks, and so that's been distracting me right now. And it's it's like helping me focus a little bit more because i'm not having those you know negative thoughts about just random things."
214.0,Provider,um. Do you think it's the pressure of the stress.
13802.0,Patient,"I think it is yeah I would say yes cuz Sunday before I started I just started on Monday. I was feeling anxious like you know I I didn't I really didn't want to go. But I usually get like this one, I have to go to school, but now that i'm there right now it's not the same as it's been the past times i've been there. Yes, i'm still stressing out but it's not like taking over the whole day you know. When, in the past, I would get home i'll just be in a bad mood because you know all this, but like right now it's just like whatever you know."

214.0,Provider,"Not one, so let me. start, let me start with this. I know this is a ginger topic. And I know and i'm trying to be really respectful. And I don't want to push you the reason we ask is because then we can figure out if the thoughts are happening not that you're going to do anything but if the thoughts are happening. That means something's not happening with the medication and that's why we kind of keep going back to these questions to be like okay. If he's saying no. we're for the medication must be working you see what i'm saying so. The information is a little off it doesn't okay."
13802.0,Patient,Okay well yeah no I haven't had I haven't been having those thoughts.

Were stressed me about school was that every day we test we take a test every day and our stress out to the point where they would have me to test and i'll start shaking hands are sweaty, but these past days that we've been testing like i've been good like. I just read the question like I think about it and I don't panic as much. And I don't know like I said I don't know that's the medication that's like not. Our equipment, like my mind, is not running. Good like before. Like i'm not having. These dump thoughts of. Past i'm not having these. Like random thoughts for for them to distract me."
214.0,Provider,"Okay. So. Alright, so, then we are seeing an improvement, but overall it sounds like there are these small struggles. D, are you accepting of this of this small struggles, or are you getting frustrated over the small struggle."

214.0,Provider,Was everybody was going to you for the go to.
13802.0,Patient,"Information, yes, yes, yes. And so I started thinking like or like. Like I. yeah I started, bringing the problems home to the point where we would argue, where you know, like. Just I would have all these bad thought random thoughts and my wife told me one like you know that's not normal. Like you know how you think of all these things in your head and like you know why, why would someone do that. So, and so now it's just like more. Like I don't I try not to think about anything and if I do a goes away right away. And it's weird because I that's never happened to me."
214.0,Provider,Do you also think that the separation of your mom and dad has an impact to who you were and that's how you will coming home.

13802.0,Patient,"yeah she said it was all right well what I told her was that, like like the same thing I told you that I was at 150 but I felt like it wasn't working because I started like. Having negative thoughts, but not negative thoughts like suicidal thoughts just negative thoughts over."
