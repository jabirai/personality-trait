And I quit for 25 years. Until about three years ago. And then I was when I was overly medicated is when I stopped taking all the medications that they gave me, I felt like a zombie I was really tired all the time and somebody offered me methamphetamine. told me that this drug was different than it was. Today, to change since 25 years ago I told me that I might like it, and all this other stuff and I decided to try it and I did, and I continued to do it for two and a half years.

I have ruptured discs and bulging discs and I have like a slew of physical problems from multiple car accidents so they've. been prescribing pain pills, for most of my life and i've been on it on and off of them for most of my life and. I didn't know that I was bipolar and in the midst of been on medication, I was seeing. A doctor recommended that I go see somebody for my mental illness, because I just thought that I had ptsd and depression. And all the antidepressants were working for me and a doctor suggested that I might have bipolar and ran some tests and tried some medications and they were seeming to work, but then like I said they just kept talking on more and more pills until I was on 11 medications. And yeah and my body was not doing well, I had gained so much weight, I was almost 200 pounds. At my frame that i'm at now because I way like 120 now, so you can imagine how, and it was very painful to be way that much it was really hard to even move.

16912.0,Patient,"sort of I was trying to kill myself with they were just you know, on drugs. that's why that's why I didn't care that somebody tried to kill me with them, it only made me mad that it didn't work. I put myself into situations that should have by all rights killed anybody, but it never happened every time that I. Every time I picked up a needle and filled a completely full of drugs, I would hope that that would be the last time tag never wake up, you know, I was found unconscious several times, I was found seen several times, I they nobody ever used, nor can on me I just I don't know how I. came back around but I good."
383.0,Provider,So you described these overdoses suicide attempts.

383.0,Provider,Would you say that was a suicide attempt by overdose or.
16912.0,Patient,"More like I was hopeful that it wasn't necessarily an attempt. I knew I was going into rehab. is more like it was my last do or die kind of thing like if it didn't kill me then I was that I would just live, you know, and then I would stop doing what I was doing and find a better way. Get hopes that I needed. yeah, I have three marriages."
383.0,Provider,How are you feeling about your life now in terms of. reasons to live and.
16912.0,Patient,"And much better. much, much better, especially. I found out yesterday that my son has been hurting himself, but I took him to the doctor and he my son i'm pretty sure has bipolar as well, you have to talk for a minute coming up to. To try some medication with him he's struggles a lot like I do, and he has suicidal ideology, but he doesn't attempted. And I just found out that he was cutting himself pretty bad and he always wears a hoodie and. The doctor talk to him alone, and he confided in the doctors and showed him what he'd been doing. And he has scars that are pretty horrendous on his arms and I used to do the same thing and he's got constant depression. And so, one thing that has kept me from not killing my cell phone, together with my children I didn't want them to have to go through that to do what I will happen with me, you know I by finding somebody I love dead. and Now that I can't leave my children. That, if I did they will probably end up stimulus I did. I know that my son needs me too much, and so does my daughter. to know, like, I have no intention done not have every reason there is to live. doing everything in my power to. make my recovery work and it's going really well, I found a syringe in my house yesterday, when I was packing up some of my stuff and It made me sick to my stomach just finding that there was no drugs in it. But I immediately, you know checked myself. And I went to a meeting. You know, and I told my fiance He threw it away he dispose of it, so that you know, nobody else would find it in my son was home, you know, and I just you know I. I lost my kids a year ago, because my stupid bullshit. me being selfish. And I know I can't be that person anymore, I know I have to get better. i've been doing a lot better. If I don't feel like that anymore I don't feel like I want to die, I feel like I want to live yeah now i'm like worried that something bad is going to happen to me because I want to live, you know, but I know that I know that my son needs me. You know I can't leave him and I can't have thoughts like that anymore. You know I know where it leads to it on the weeds about minutes you know and i'm tired of living my life in pain. And i've been for so long and now. Everything hurts so much more than it did before you know it's like. Feelings are foreign to me i'm used to being numb and the only thing I ever really felt before was anger and now you know it seems like I cry over everything. You know, but it makes me. It makes me really angry really mad at myself, because I know I call chest pain. yeah he started getting depressed when because he fell in my drugs and he gave them somebody else and they call the COPs. that's how."
383.0,Provider,When when was that.
16912.0,Patient,A year ago.

And I. I recently conceded, and I, I gave up my rights to her. So that she could move to Alaska and I get supervised visits in the hour and threats up to him. and I got my son back that was never court ordered or anything I didn't lose lose him I willingly gave him up to keep him safe to keep them out of the system, I knew I wasn't willing to take care of him. yeah."

So even feeling happy is like foreign to me it feels uncomfortable. Sometimes I have to force myself to smile because it feels weird to smile and it's comfortable to be miserable I guess. Because i've been miserable for most of my life. yeah i'd like to know, some coping mechanisms and just. How to be okay this feelings like I guess. yeah how to process things like a normal person. You know i've been really good lately about not getting mad over stuff and trying to be less judgmental on people, so I always kind of like. Look at people like well, if I can do that thing, so can you, you know, like, if I can clean the House and I can feed the dogs and feed the kids and do laundry then so, can you, you know kind of mentality like i'm i'm really good at multitasking I know other people aren't. But I have a hard time not judging people for not being up to par for. You my standards. So i've been working on that one doing pretty well to not getting so upset about things, I take a lot of things really personally and I don't know why. But I am trying to, not because I know it occupies a lot of space in my head that I don't. it's not good for me."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16912.0,Patient,"So you know i'm just other things like that you know, like i'm having problems with my intimacy and I feel like my body is foreign now because. Mostly, I used to sex as a way of controlling people. When I was younger and on drugs and not on drugs, because I was molested and raped so many times that I didn't ever want to film anything so I just disconnected and i'm having a really hard time reconnecting with my fiance. physically. Like I. I love cuddling with them and everything is just just got hurt I don't really know how to be.

But that's my hump that's like my as soon as I get to three months, I always seem to relapse you know there's just something really awful happens that breaks me, and so you know I just I got 30 days, not very long ago I got like 34 days, I think, right now, and so i'm really nervous. about when I come up to that three month mark of. How to prepare myself to. not rely yeah that's how long, I made it last time, and you know, like I didn't you know I made it past my brother's death and having a miscarriage at the same time, and I still stayed strong but I didn't. I think I was still numb I wasn't really dealing with it, I was just ignoring it and then by the third miscarriage I broke me I couldn't handle it anymore. And I didn't have an outlet a way to deal with stress Okay, I like writing I tried all sorts of stuff but nothing works."

383.0,Provider,"Okay, thanks. bye bye. Okay brief suicide risk assessment, I would say she's low to moderate risk. let's just put actually right now moderate i'm turning off the video and whiskey keep talking moderate risk level due to self described. Drug past drug use as suicide attempt by overdose. Her protective factors are engagement and treatment motivated to live for her son. And just self statements that she does not want to enter life. Risk factors are. What I mentioned before, as well as. Just a unstable mood pending any circumstantial. tragedies that could exist could happen in her life. And that's where we're at with the suicide risk assessment, I think that let's say that she's moderate risk and that we will continue to assess for suicide risk in all future individual appointments Thank you."
