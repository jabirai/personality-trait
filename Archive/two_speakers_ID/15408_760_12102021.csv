760.0,Provider,"Hello Felix. How are you. Okay, can you repeat your audio is kind of fuzzy."
15408.0,Patient,"So i'm Okay, how are you."
760.0,Provider,"Doing Okay, do you have earphones because it's kind of hard to hear you have any maybe change the microphone a little bit."
15408.0,Patient,i'm sure.
760.0,Provider,There that sounds better just can't see you now. There we go. Okay okay that's much better alright so have you been this past couple weeks.
15408.0,Patient,"i've been okay um I don't know um I noticed i've been a little more irritable I don't know i'm not i'm not sure what I usually I kind of get this way towards the end of the year and I noticed, I think I think it's because. I think, because in December is when my dad passed away, so I think subconsciously or something I don't know what it is, but I just even my wife says, I get kind of like grouchy and. An irritable towards the end of the year, but I first I thought it might have been the antidepressants or something, but I don't think that's a side effect so it might just be because it's the end of the year."
760.0,Provider,"Okay yeah it could be in the in the anniversary is passing how many years ago, was that again."
15408.0,Patient,It was in 2013 so.
760.0,Provider,Some years. Okay. But it's still it's still a struggle.
15408.0,Patient,yeah yeah Thank you kind of.
760.0,Provider,"Think it's kind of a double whammy it's like the anniversary or around the anniversary, but at the same time it's like that big event at the end of the year. yeah that family time it's like kind of loved the salt in the wound of the grieving."
15408.0,Patient,yeah a little bit yeah.
760.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay well um We talked last time, and what we had talked about last time that you wanted to focus on we're learning to work through anger Depression and anxiety. So what we need to do from here Felix is develop a plan. What are some of it like a focus plan, what are some of the things that that are we're going to work on, to help you address these most critical issues in your life. Is there any other, seeing that you think we should include. If we take in consideration, you know you know mental health treatment is about you know recovery for the total person for every part of who you are including physical up. And things like that, so that could include any kind of. health situation or. Self care type habits, to make you healthier or. anything like that, so, in addition to what we discussed last time anger learning coping skills learning how to better express and manage anger depression deal with depression better and handling it better, is there is there anything else you want to add to that list."
15408.0,Patient,"um I guess just. I think I mentioned that last time, it is my physical health as well. Okay um and i'm waiting right now to see when I can get scheduled to see my primary because. i've been having issues sleeping and. yeah and i'm pretty sure it's sleep apnea and related. suggested to me by one of the. I think she was a nurse or something. The lady who does my medication she should just did to do a sleep test, so I want to get that done as soon as I can, to know for sure if it's sleep apnea which i'm pretty sure it is because i'm a little bit on the bigger side so. And I, and I snore like my wife says, I snore so loud. So i'm pretty sure it's sleep apnea. Okay, I want to, I want to get that I just that and my physical health and, obviously, you know mental health, I just want to get all that you know eventually. You know manageable."
760.0,Provider,"Thursday Well, I think it's great what you're going to do the sleep study, because it seems like that that's something you need to at least check and figure out whether it's true or not. But, would you like to learn about some other natural ways of. Dealing with insomnia, in addition to the sleep study."
15408.0,Patient,Oh yeah i'm open to that as well.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, how about any health change any other changes, other than sleeping you want to make improvements to. Exercise or diet, or anything like that you want to do."
15408.0,Patient,"yeah i'm. doing my best to change my diet my exercise. What i'm not the problem is it's not trying to feel exhausted from from work and. Just pushing myself to do it, like last last time I last session. I had had a workout plan immediately after. My friend didn't get back to me, but I just went in my backyard and I just did my own thing I. lifted loads and. A long time ago I used to do like kickboxing so I did some like exercises that I had from that."
760.0,Provider,and
15408.0,Patient,"I felt, you know I felt good after I think the endorphins and other stuff released and I felt I felt better, so I definitely want to work on my exercise."
760.0,Provider,is also good for anxiety.
15408.0,Patient,"mm hmm. And okay and i'm just i'm working i've been working on my diet, I haven't had. Any like gross fast food and on on a day that I do you know, I have to get fast food because I didn't have time to pack my lunch or whatever um I I abstain from fast food so much that when I do get it, it just tastes disgusting so."
760.0,Provider,So that's good.
15408.0,Patient,"yeah so it kind of just it's that acts as a deterrent and itself or like I remember last time I got I got that you know cheeseburger from McDonalds or whatever, and it was just disgusting so. yeah like i've been packing my or my wife really it's been helping me out with you know overnight outside eat in the morning and then she makes me sound church or something healthy for lunch so or salad. So i'm gonna i'm gonna do my best to keep. track with that."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so so that one, you need to keep on track. keep on track. Alright, and the exercise. I know you probably stressed, because of a heavy work schedule so. What do you think you know when we balanced we you know being balanced is important, I mean you don't want to work 10 hours or be away from home 12 hours and then come home and work out for another two three hours because that's off. balance so. yeah you know, even if it's like two or three or four days a week. doesn't even have to be that intensive, even if it's like 20 minutes depending on depending on how it fits in your schedule with the rest of your chores so, how would you want to. How would you want to address that based on that your your daily life."
15408.0,Patient,"um I think I just need to like make some time, even for 30 minutes. Okay, maybe a day or maybe every day or every other day. got something I want to do because. A friend of a friend, that I work out with she showed me this it's a really intense interval exercise it's about 20 minutes, but with everything you're doing it's like going from jumping Jacks and dropping dropping down."
760.0,Provider,Okay i'm losing your audio again Felix i'm sorry. Sorry i'm sorry it's it's very. staticky and weird the audio.
15408.0,Patient,hear me now.
760.0,Provider,"Yes, you said something about jumping Jacks and then a."
15408.0,Patient,"friend of mine showed me this interval type training to where you do a bunch of exercises in quick succession and doing that for. I think it was like 20 minutes, or so it, it was an intense exercise were equal to equal up to like about an hour worth of exercise or something like that it's just really intense. Quick workouts so I was thinking of just doing that That way, you know I don't have to take two to three hours of my day you know. yeah i'm to exercise so. I was thinking shooting. Shooting for that at least every other day, or something."
760.0,Provider,"Okay yeah I think sometimes you need a day of breath. In order to. kind of regroup and and the other thing it's really important when you start an exercise program is to go to always speak to your medical doctor, to make sure there's nothing that's going to cause harm, should you start. Okay, so I would recommend that to. All right, okay good so we got those things out of the way as far as the anger, we could do some. me see. list. I have some notes here. You know, learning about your anger style, because we can be aggressive, or we can be. Sometimes we can be passive or passive aggressive. So maybe we can talk about that a little bit and and maybe. find out about that style and then learning how to be assertive."
15408.0,Patient,Okay.
760.0,Provider,"That sounds like a good plan, so we do see beauty for anger. and Also for anger Depression and anxiety meditation and mindfulness is good. Have you ever meditated."
15408.0,Patient,"Yes, i'm. The. In the therapy Group and Okay yeah therapy group the weekly group they went over that, like the cycles of depression and. I think last week and the week before and they talked about meditation and mindfulness and that's been helping with my depression and i've been trying to also figure as well. And for the most part it's working I just haven't I just noticed lately i've just been more irritable and i'm trying to keep it in check. But um but, for the most part, that that. The PDF that she showed the group it's been really working i've been applying that included mindfulness included meditation. And also suggested journaling. All that stuff. yeah I think that's. I think another thing I need to work on as. A better time management for myself when it comes to my mental health and physical."
760.0,Provider,"Well, one way to do it Felix would be to kind of start small you don't want to like. overwhelm yourself with 100 different things, all at once, and then people have a tendency to get frustrated. And maybe they might get hard on themselves, and then they just kind of throw in the towel. So I think you know we're coming with a plan, but sometimes these can be either a short term plan, some of these items and then some of them can be more of a longer term plan and we can kind of build and as we're working together if that makes sense. You know, you can do you can do a meditation in. Five minutes or less and you've already talked about condensing down your exercise to 30 minutes a day, every other day, which is more manageable. But I don't want you to get to the point where you're feeling overwhelmed. Okay um The other thing. Do you think that did there's a. I know it's been many years since your father passed, but do you think you're still cycling through the the stages of grief."
15408.0,Patient,"With his pattern yeah I don't think. Sorry, I keep stuttering."
760.0,Provider,worry about it.
15408.0,Patient,it's not as bad as it was the first few years the first few years it was bad. But yeah I think I still am. going through those cycles of grief. So yeah yeah I guess.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, do you think that there's any part of you, that is trying to push those feelings out of your mind or deny them or shove them down or judge them in any way or."
15408.0,Patient,"I think the. big part of it um my issue before is when anything negative like that I just bottle it up or push it away and try not to. You know, no one wants to fill fill all that kind of negative emotion, or whatever, so I think that's a big part of it is me trying to suppress it."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay. And that's probably going to cause irritation, because you know, one of the stages of grief is anger. And so you know, maybe, maybe it just maybe it's kind of mild and maybe it's moderate I don't know you would know better, but. But you know you're getting a little irritable and so that's you know kind of tied with one of the stages. And a lot of times men have an easier time, especially when they don't like to be overly emotional in front of others are just within themselves Angers sometimes is one of the easier ones to express. That makes sense."
15408.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"makes perfect so. i'd like to work do some cognitive behavioral work with you and and see if we can start learning healthier ways to. manage and number one identify the emotions you're going through that doesn't mean you have to like you know cry every second or where your emotions on your sleeve, but it is important to find the right time, the right safe place to. express that to get that out, because if you're going to hold on to it, it is going to come out. it's gonna it's not going to go anywhere and it's going to come out. at the wrong time and the wrong way."
15408.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"If you had that experience, where it came out at the wrong time at the wrong way."
15408.0,Patient,Oh yeah yeah definitely.
760.0,Provider,"Okay Either that, or it can kind of implode and cause sickness or mental health issues that's The other thing that can happen so okay so dealing with grief all right um. Let me see. So talk to me about. The sleep issues you so many hours and ideas, especially thing."
15408.0,Patient,i'm see. Between five to six hours a night.
760.0,Provider,"Okay five to six hours a night all right. Do you try to do so mindfulness is good for that meditation is good for that relaxation techniques, do you turn off all your devices there's no TV on the phone is not there by your pillow that kind of thing."
15408.0,Patient,"yeah um so I have a unique sleeping arrangement, right now, so my my wife and son they sleep in the living room it's not because, like we have issues or anything like that it's just it started because. I used to have to get up really well, I still do but get up either really early or have to get up really late because depending on my schedule and work. So I didn't want to have to set an alarm and then wake up the. baby, and you know because of my alarms so and we ended up in the bed that we sleep on just it would just demolish my back I would wake up with back issues, so my mother in law bought me a special mattress and. We had for a time, had it all in the same room, but again because of my alarm my just my schedule separate at night and. sleep in another in another room so there's not room for me to sleep by. phone."
760.0,Provider,there's no TV on.
15408.0,Patient,"No, no, TV on, if anything, every now and then I really can't sleep on this music and it kind of helps. me fall asleep. But um. yeah but that's where i'm at so no, no, electronics, no lights nothing like that one i'm."
760.0,Provider,Good and how about the body temperature.
15408.0,Patient,"um I tried it I run hot, so I try to be cool, I have a ceiling fan on and since it's all dark and the room i'm in has tile for the floor it gets stays pretty chilly. Sometimes I get a little cold, you know I have like a blanket but, for the most part, I can't really speak with a blanket for long because I just oh."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right. Okay, so all right, so I guess. So you're doing a lot of the right things with that said already that's good all right. So talk to me about how you do in identifying your emotions right now. identify what you're feeling today."
15408.0,Patient,"Today i'm irritable today. I feel. Like right now I just feel I feel hot in my face, I mean I know it's not really an emotion, but I don't know if it's because. i'm feeling irritable or if i'm or like small things are going to be worked up i'm trying to like let it just be water, you know down my back, but and I guess I get in this cycle of being frustrated with myself for feeling the way i'm feeling because I don't want to feel this way. Sometimes I don't feel like i'm in control like like today, I have no reason being feeling irritable um. I just I get frustrated because you know I don't want to feel this way, I want to feel happy, I feel chipper you know I just the littlest thing can make me feel irritable and I get into this like it's just snowballs and I just wanted to start."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so maybe there's some unconscious things going on, because you say there's nothing really bothering you. yeah okay so you're feeling a little bit irritated right now."
15408.0,Patient,"Just just overall this day like right now, I feel I feel calm because i'm able to just you know talk and. Let it out. So, for the most part, right now, I feel, calm I parked somewhere because i'm at work. And i'm on my lunch break but. i'm you know I parked somewhere i'm in downtown I parked up high on this building, you know it's nice to feel calm, but I can feel the air units, you know it was good it's Nice and cold so right now i'm like i'm in an OK space, I guess."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right all right um. Well, which of these areas, do you think you want to work on, first, I mean i'd like you, you know use me you mentioned journaling and you said you want to do journaling but there's a part of you that thinks that it's going to be too many things. so, which ones, would you want to work on first Felix."
15408.0,Patient,"um. I kind of want to start to journaling because I feel like if I if I write down what's bugging me or if I write down how I feel I feel like that Oh, I feel like that'll help for aid. me and I don't know figuring out what what's triggering me or or or why I feel the way I feel i'm."
760.0,Provider,"journaling doesn't have to be like you don't have to write 10 pages, a day, you can, if you want to, if you have the time to and you want to, but even if you just journal like like a page, or even a couple of paragraphs. Starting with learning to identify your emotions and then maybe some of the things you're thinking about and how that affects what behavior choices that you make, either on the positive or maybe the negative either way. That would be one way to start journaling I do have Felix I can email this to you. I like this for people who have a tendency to repress emotion, because this, this is what we call an emotion we'll Have you ever go be."
15408.0,Patient,kind of see it oh yeah. I can kind of see it yeah.
760.0,Provider,"So I like this, because it breaks down the emotions, in the very Center and smallest circle and the different colors you'll have the basic emotions. Happy sad disgusted angry fearful bad. And surprised and then you know if we take. You know, take sad in the blue here in a kind of fans out and it'll give you different versions, you know the basic emotion is sad but but it gives you different versions of sad, including like hurt despair guilt lonely vulnerable abandoned. Empty and it kind of gives you a little way to kind of thoughtfully think about what you're feeling, so that you can get in touch because there is a huge correlation between. What we're thinking how that affects our emotions and and behavior. And, and one of the first steps in in healing and and also grieving and dealing with anger and depression and all that is identifying what's going on. Because if you're repressing it is still affecting you but you know you don't have any way to really focus your attention to make it better like that so would you like me to send you this in the email Okay, so I will. preferably as soon as we get done here, but if I have time i'll get it done before I quit for the day, so that you have it, and you can start journaling and you know, make it small little things don't don't overwhelm yourself don't feel like you have to write 100 pages. But let me just confirm that we have the right, email before I have. F E Li si Ay Ay in Ob a ll E at gmail."
15408.0,Patient,that's correct.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, so I will get that sent to you, and then I also have. In that same attachment I have like a mindfulness sheet, I may just go ahead and send you that, as well as there's. A little mindfulness practices we'll go over that again a little bit later, but maybe since you've already kind of started that with group. You can kind of take a look at that as well. So, so I like that so you're going to do the journaling you're going to do the sleep study. And the exercise is that what you what you said you wanted to start with. Right whoo okay okay."
15408.0,Patient,"I guess i'm pretty sure that journaling will help but um, I think, right now, the one thing i'm worried like i'm worried about just because it affects you know it can affect just everything is just my my anger. um. So I don't know if there's exercises or whatever anything that can help with that as well. Okay, I don't want to feel like i'm trying to like buy more than what I can chew but."
760.0,Provider,"I think i'm questioning that some of your anger might be repressed emotions and you know. I think a lot of men that we just discussed a little while ago, a lot of men are uncomfortable with feeling vulnerable and crying and doing those kinds of emotions and so. The only outlet they sometimes some men might have would be to get angry, and so I think this whole point of the journaling and learning to be more in touch with your emotions. Also, when you're doing the journaling keep in mind, you can have multiple emotions, at the same time, and sometimes your emotions can even be conflicting they don't even have to make sense, because you're you're kind of you know. Some people don't understand that they don't have to say, well, how can I be happy and mad, at the same time, but as possible. You know, because there's different parts to us, we have different sides on different things, and this part may be happy about some situation and this other part over here is mad about it but it's really important to express the emotion on on both sides. That makes sense. So so it's not logical, so if you're a logical guy. fix your emotions to be logical like your brain. So that would be one thing I would say, and and don't be afraid to journal about the happy emotions. or some of some of the surprised ones are positive emotions too so whatever it is just turn a lot of. Okay, you know you know it doesn't always have to be about the bad stuff it's about learning learning the process of. Who, you are, as a person, what you're feeling what you're thinking being more aware of that, so that you can. kind of we can talk about that and and kind of question some of those thoughts or feelings and maybe like look at it in a different way, but I think if you start to work on the emotions. The anger part will come along."
15408.0,Patient,OK.
760.0,Provider,"So in and be just be mindful as well about. The holidays and the anniversary when is the anniversary of my father's passing, if I can us."
15408.0,Patient,yeah it's on the 13th December.
760.0,Provider,December oh that's an that's three days away. yeah so that could be the irritation right there. That makes sense.
15408.0,Patient,yeah that makes sense.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right all right so maybe maybe on the 13th 13th is what day of the week, this week, do you work on the 13th. On Monday."
15408.0,Patient,yo yeah yeah I work Monday.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, well, maybe try to do some journaling maybe take some a little bit more time, maybe on Sunday, the day before. To process your feelings about the anniversary coming up, and maybe maybe take one day to journal, a little bit more. Saturday or Sunday whichever one works best in your schedule again and just be prepared to kind of talk about things that you discover about yourself. and And we'll start with that and then i'll i'll bring we can talk more about anger, how do you express when you get angry what What do you do you do, how would you characterize yourself, are you aggressive, are you passive aggressive or you assertive Do you know what all those terms mean."
15408.0,Patient,"Some of them I think i'm just aggressive when I get you know when I start feeling angry or mad. Okay, I probably lash out when I shouldn't. verbally yeah. that's that's something I want you know, obviously not to do stop."
760.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Okay. All right. Okay well assertive behavior assertive expression of anger. Is. a place of kind of acknowledging what i'm feeling. And and and when we can also apply some mindfulness with that too, and just you know my anger and is a very unpleasant emotion and we don't that's one of the ones we don't like to to feel but, at the end of the day, emotion or anger is just a feeling it's just an emotion. it's going to come. it's going to go and. The emotion of anger does not make you is not a mistake it's not something you did wrong. it's only our behavior choices, if we can learn to channel our anger and be assertive and not aggressive or passive or passive aggressive. that's the positive thing, because it acknowledges the anger, but, but it also acknowledges the other person. And one thing you can do if you're feeling angry is take some deep breaths maybe practice, some of those mindfulness exercises or meditation or just take get some fresh air. Take a short walk get yourself out of that situation and give yourself time to come down. That would be the one thing that we could kind of talk about right now. Okay Okay, but i'm going to bring some more information on on the three because there's there's also passive aggressive. Basically, generally aggressive is kind of like an attitude like I right and you're wrong. person who's passive has this attitude of i'm wrong and you're right. Passive aggressive usually starts as passive, but then it flips because the anger builds and then they become aggressive. Whereas assertive. acknowledges both sides, as you know, is willing to acknowledge the emotion of anger, but is also willing to take the time and the space to talk it out and try to reach an understanding with that other individual that you may be angry with. that's, generally speaking, what is service. You know. And and and keep in mind you're human So if you catch yourself being aggressive than I don't know, are you could to make an apology to the people you care about perhaps your wife."
15408.0,Patient,"yeah i'd say the last two years I have been better on that before it would take me such a long time to just work up to college guys. It was a real, it was a real problem with friendships and. Relationships my life."
760.0,Provider,With friendship will.
15408.0,Patient,"yeah i'd say so, I have a small friend group so um I don't know, I was just always I was always just download about saying you know sorry or apologizing and. It would take. I don't know it would take far too long, and what I would feel was needed for me to say something. yeah."
760.0,Provider,"And, and what do you think changed now how long how long ago was that and what's changed now for you. only get better."
15408.0,Patient,"I just think. It was putting a strain on my marriage with me and my wife and we just we sat down talked about it and. You know I don't I don't remember I don't remember the exact details of it, but I know you know, basically, if I couldn't. start changing you know in certain ways than that you know, ultimately, she might you know, want to leave or something so. I want to say it was just I think it was a bit you know big disagreement or argument we got into and I realized, you know what I need to I need to apologize or. And a lot sooner than than what you know, usually do or it's just going to make things worse and I noticed, since that moment it stuck with me and now much, much more quicker to be like you know what you know that was stupid i'm sorry. And you know, although you may not, you may be still mad at me now and brush off my apology, but you know, in the past and it's shown you know you'll come around in an hour or two or whatever, how long it takes me, you know acknowledge my apology and accept it and stuff so."
760.0,Provider,Okay. So how often do you say you react and verbally aggressive way.
15408.0,Patient,"not sure, more often than i'd like I, I know I know lately i've been i've been catching myself. And, but you know, sometimes it still kind of slips and."
760.0,Provider,yeah.
15408.0,Patient,Just something i'm working on.
760.0,Provider,But if these kinds of things happen that would be something that you could journal about.
15408.0,Patient,"yeah something that sticks out to me in particular within this last week sometime or actually no yeah within this week, so our dryer messed up or a dryer broke. So we had to order a new one. So my wife ordered a new one, and it was supposed to be delivered Wednesday, but. turns out. Either the either there was a mistake either made on her per the people, she ordered it from but a washer was he said. Oh, and she would and she texts me she's like hey like I. tell you something I didn't want to tell you, because I was afraid, how you react, but I put an apple washer was being sensitive with writer i'm."
760.0,Provider,Losing i'm losing your audio again I apologize be like. Okay yeah okay there we go try. try again okay better now okay sorry about that.
15408.0,Patient,"So um so basically she was like Oh, I was afraid of how you react, you know I should have told you sooner, but a washer is coming instead of a dryer."
760.0,Provider,And i'm doing everything I can get it fixed.
15408.0,Patient,"And I was at work when that happened and I looked at that message and I immediately felt horrible because I was like. I was trying to think like well how did I react in the past, so badly for her to be afraid of how. If I was going to blow up or how I was going to react to a dry borrow a washer getting delivered instead of a dryer so I immediately texted back saying you know, and I felt good after because I. know I caught my slate I didn't catch myself, but I. I guess, I had a riff what's the word i'm looking for a moment of like reflection."
760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15408.0,Patient,"And and and noticed, you know, in the past, I acknowledge like yeah I probably would have blown up like you know 567 years ago I probably would have. would have blown up, I would have I would have you know got really mad and just being like how could you have ordered a washer instead of a dryer that's so you know how how did you not double check, but you know I texted back, and I was like hey it's okay. You know just. will deal with a basically you know we'll see if we can get a refund and we'll just exchange, you know it for a dryer and. We we had washed we had done laundry at a friend's house this past weekend I said, you know we can just do that again it's okay what's another two weeks when we can just you know go to a friend's house and do laundry it's okay and. I felt good because I didn't I I felt good and bad because you know, like I said what my past self should was so bad that my wife was afraid to tell me that she accidentally you know. accidentally order the wrong appliance and you know she thought I was going to blow up so that you know I felt terrible but. It made me also reflect like hey you know you need to get a better handle on when mistakes happen or when things don't go your way and not not to react, like the horrible you know."
760.0,Provider,"Personally, you put you did get a handle that's a step you you you, you could have blown up in that moment, you know you could have blown up and then apologize later talked about but you didn't you caught that from the very beginning, before. Before and I don't know if you felt and you probably felt angry, I think I think any one of us would feel frustration or anger, to be getting the wrong. order."
15408.0,Patient,When we need a dryer and.
760.0,Provider,"We get a washer and. Regardless of whose fault, I think there would be angry, I mean, I think I will be angry about that. But you handled it sounds like assertiveness to me."
15408.0,Patient,"yeah it was it was a fleeting moment of anger like it It came at me really quick like oh my God like what and then, once I was like I was you know once I read the rest of the message I kind of just it kind of just left, and I was like you know what it's okay. You know we're basically we'll just we'll figure it out and. yeah basically. figure it out we'll do that."
760.0,Provider,"That was a third unassertive reaction to anger that incident that you just described that's what assertiveness is you, so the anger wasn't wrong. You know you weren't you didn't make a mistake and feeling angry about that, but did you handle that really bad. So that's that's real progress, you should feel proud of yourself over that. anger is a kind of a hard one it's like it happens, like snap and."
15408.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"You know it, you know we don't really think very well in the moment. We get angry, because we just it's. it's like kind of. like an instantaneous. emotion, it just takes over and thoughts kind of shut off. period of time, and a lot of. People so you handled that really well Felix we do yeah so good, good for you okay so. All right, um. So what else has anything else happening or. Any stress at work."
15408.0,Patient,"or he's always a little works always like a little stressful but. i'm just kind of like letting it go in one ear out the other and we're kind of like just letting it roll down my back it's just. there's it's just that i'm always cleaning messes or i'm always cleaning, you know clean these properties so. I think just I get frustrated because I just feel like. The client or my bosses don't understand that hey someone can come in and make a mess long gone clean, you know after I already clean this place, you know someone because I mainly do with like homeless people coming in and trashing place or something like that. Oh that's all. that's a stressful feeling. yeah a little bit I definitely prefer this over my last job or my old job which i've been doing for like 10 years which was security. That one that one was a real stressor and how I think about it in hindsight it didn't really help with how I handled my anger or or anything like that either, because I was always you know dealing with with security stuff in, and I was always alone and isolated at work so. My work now like the work stresses much more manageable. job."
760.0,Provider,"Okay okay well it's still sounds a little stressful I know when you're dealing with that population they they can be so careless. yeah and there's a lot of them, many of them under the influence. So yeah oh yeah so okay okay Felix well um. So that's that's what i'm I will. I will get this emotion we'll set to you, and if you could start, even if it's just a little bit of time if if you're feeling stressed just journal, maybe at the end of the day, maybe as you're falling asleep or about to fall asleep would be a good time because. that's a place that you said that you. You know you use your your wife and and child sleep in the other room so that's a place that you have you can even if it's just like 1520 minutes kind of reflect back pick a couple maybe three or at least three two to three emotions that were kind of. recurrent through the day or how you felt through the day it, but if there's more feel free to write more I just don't want you to feel so overwhelmed that you're going to stop doing it. Okay okay all right, so I will go ahead and send that to you now go ahead and email it. As soon as we get off. um do we have our appointments set up from here."

Right now, and you can I would encourage you to keep the same appointment time unless your schedule doesn't allow for that. But if your schedule changes, then that's fine we'll go week by week but might be best to try to pick a time and stick to it as long as your schedule allows."
