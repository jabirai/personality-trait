15322.0,Patient,"Okay, no problem."
383.0,Provider,"So um how have you been since our last appointment, did you have a chance to do what we discussed and have you had any incidents of feeling uncomfortable."
15322.0,Patient,"Actually, not too much different from down in this two weeks. Industry two week yeah i'm actually very, very busy oh ty I because I purchase a house, but the House is a really poor condition, but it's a really good location, so I my family, we live in, so so we I. take a long time to to offer it to to to to manage the worker to do the right things, and so it's a busy busy time."
383.0,Provider,I see.
15322.0,Patient,"So no too not too much. Not too much time to think. Back things. yeah so just just went crazy and past two weeks and and my wife told told me oh you, you need to meet amanda in five groups I i'd be late, so I yes that's the whole story."
383.0,Provider,I see okay well we're good and. i'm really glad that you have been feeling because you're so busy that you're not thinking about you're not having these into incidents of having these impulsive thoughts.
15322.0,Patient,yeah so incidents yes.
383.0,Provider,"So that's really a good thing that you know, sometimes when we're very busy and we've got a lot to do it helps focus us and we don't have the intrusive. Negative thinking so that's good. Did you have a chance to great we talked about writing about safety and danger, did you have any chance to write anything I think anything about your feelings about danger and your feelings about safety."
15322.0,Patient,"No, no, yes yeah but I, I have this in my my I remember I mentor told me to write down all the detail, compared to good are no good when the incident happened what what back consequence to my family on to me, so I remember that, but you don't have a chance to turn it down."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, do you have anything that you'd like to maybe we can just discuss it a little bit with that okay. Yes, okay. So, what are your thoughts about just about safety in general. If you know. Like maybe the ways that you try to keep yourself and your family safe. You know. Any thoughts that you have about safety. that you would like to just share."
15322.0,Patient,"Your i'm sorry, what was the Christian anything about safety."
383.0,Provider,"Right so let's say like, if I were to start you know. I know, for me, like I. Some people choose certain cars over other cars, because they think it will be more safe, you know they choose a big cars, you know because they think it's more safe than little cars. I don't necessarily do that i'm somewhere in between, you know I don't need a big car to feel safe i'm kind of somewhere in between. Other things that helped me to feel safe, are you know safety from financial disaster, you know, so I like to have a certain amount of my checking account, you know that makes me feel more safe, you know, then, if I had. You know hundred dollars in my safe to sit So these are just i'm just sharing with you, things that helped me to feel safe, you know I locked my door at night that helps me to feel more safe and if I left with leave it on unlocked. And that kind of thing."
15322.0,Patient,"Okay, yes, I agree in before you say yeah and the bank account have. enough money. Not not too much or too small, because if you have a loan money, maybe you you You ran out where the fast you, you have a lot of things to do so, you. You calculate what in the liar in the press in the future, half year what your expand you have, but you have in love to cover or a half year stand, you will have saved the periods."
383.0,Provider,Right right.
15322.0,Patient,"Yes, and. that's for money and and live for food yeah so. If the refrigerator don't have enough food you go to costco code somewhere to buy. And you're hungry. or even though you're not too many hungry, but you you. You want to eat something that's safe and. lie you go to restaurants, even though you are not wally. Not not wally. rick rick needed but yeah maybe you later, you, you need to go. Some. Some location, that you are not convenient to. Have the. restaurant the restaurant restaurant tam tam you you go to a restaurant first that's."
383.0,Provider,"Or you might choose a restroom that were in a neighborhood where you. would feel safe like you wouldn't. Maybe go to a place where you felt like there would be dangerous people, maybe drugs being sold or something like that."
15322.0,Patient,"i'm sorry, can you say."
383.0,Provider,"That that you might choose let's say you had to use the restroom and you needed to go to a garage need to go to a gas station, you might choose a gas station, that is, in a decent neighborhood. Rather than go to a gas station where the restroom where you know that you know, there might be drug sales and things like that."
15322.0,Patient,yeah correct.
383.0,Provider,Like staying out of like neighborhoods that were you know it could be dangerous.
15322.0,Patient,"lie lie i'm putting in a in a parking lot and this parking lot is from a small zoom small small part have about people pay ground, and when I pack this car. Just only my car, so I feel safe and when I communicate with you another car is is going to parking so I feel a little bit and saved it, but after that I see a street girls they take a basketball to go to the prequel so at that at this time I feel more safe. Yes."
383.0,Provider,"Yes, yes, so we're kind of evaluating you know. A range of safe and unsafe situations. Just as you're saying like when the car drove up you felt a little bit less safe but then, when you saw the three girls who felt that it was better you know more safe. And you chose a place, you know where you felt more safe now when we're talking about these these behaviors that you have had in the past. Have a good going very close to places that were unsafe like you know those high buildings that you mentioned and. Do you think that do you do you want to say anything about maybe an any kind of what do you think motivated you to maybe go to that place of more safety than safety."
15322.0,Patient,"To location that's only be. My alone, and this location. it's wally if if I have a certain feeling that will kill myself. So in that location, I feel more unsafe like let's say if I on the mountain if if, in the edge of there. On the top, so I feel unsafe, but if the mountain the slope is aware of the fact, even though I jam. I won't kill myself. And in that location, I will feel safe so it's dependent on how how slow, it is."
383.0,Provider,"Right. yeah um. So when you go toward places that for you feel unsafe. and Can you reinforce to yourself, I want to protect myself, I want to stay close to the area that is safe for me. rim, saying that to yourself, reminding yourself that safety is important to you that your safety is important. I don't know if you're understanding me very well."
15322.0,Patient,Can you say a repeat again.
383.0,Provider,"Sure i'm in this effort that we're making to to. help you. One of the things that i'm trying to encourage you to do is to. to remind yourself, of the importance and value of your safety. And that and the safety of your family and that when let's say you're going, you know you mentioned that there's some high roads that you won't drive on because you know it's could you could go off the side you know. You know what i'm saying. Yes, yeah right So if you trusted yourself that you're going to protect yourself. You see, if you trusted that you will do everything, and you. You want to protect yourself. And reminding yourself of that with frequency. D is that does that make sense."
15322.0,Patient,"yeah let's say if I will award myself to go to the danger location. them, even though i'm in the thing geolocation. IE I should protect myself as well, it is that. yeah."
383.0,Provider,"Even though you're in a dangerous location you're thinking to yourself. Okay i'm i'm I am going to drive slowly i'm going to drive carefully, because this is a dangerous road, and I could I could you know, so I will be driving extra safe and I will be driving extra carefully. Because I am protecting myself and anyone that is in this car by doing that. You know, and so, in your mind you're thinking more about protection and safety. Just as a habit, to try to get you to because what's happening, I think, is you're afraid of your own self. you're afraid that you will do something. yeah yeah. And so what we want to do is build your confidence and build your own. Your own commitment internally to your safety, so that you don't fear yourself. Does that make sense."
15322.0,Patient,"How to build my bill this commitment, just keep on reminding myself."
383.0,Provider,"it's it's not just reminding yourself like. Okay, like it's just a sentence and you're just saying the sentence over and over you are considering. How, you are protecting yourself in all of your actions and thoughts, like, for instance, you did so by choosing to park your car in a park you're not parked on a street corner in downtown Los Angeles right now for a reason. Now it may be, because your House is nowhere near downtown Los Angeles, but. it's also part in part because you don't want to be in an area where you could get you know that's more dangerous. You make that choice. So you're making wise choices for yourself, and you are trusting yourself to do that. And you're doing it, you see."
15322.0,Patient,"Yes, in around 99% or 90% of my. Oh, when I wear the normal and the really good controller, just in case, sometimes I am free myself to do something crazy things."
383.0,Provider,"Okay okay. So if you have impulses to do. Some crazy things you may want to explore other ways of doing those okay I let me just explain to you. So let's say you want to do some dangerous things you just kind of do you know. There are safe ways of doing dangerous things like, for instance. there's ways, you can you can pay money to go on an airplane and jump off of it. and have a parachute. and have someone teach you how to release the parachute. And you can do that as people do that as recreation. You know jumping out of planes with a parachute. that's that's pretty scary to my and my mind I would never do it, I can do it. Okay, but some people pay money."
15322.0,Patient,"To do it, yes."
383.0,Provider,"And they do it safely but it's still very scary because the jumping out of an airplane right. So there may be, you may want to do some scary things. In a safe way."
15322.0,Patient,hmm.
383.0,Provider,"and You know I I wouldn't recommend jumping out of airplanes but maybe something like you know when you go swimming and in like those big swimming pools that have the high dive they have a really high dive at the top. hmm and they have a low dive. And maybe you get a swimming lesson, if you know how to swim well first you need to know how to swim I don't know if you do or not."
15322.0,Patient,I did.
383.0,Provider,"And just diving off of a top of the swimming pool just just to experience the in a way kind of like the fun of it. But having it in a safe way, do you see what i'm saying."
15322.0,Patient,let's let's say a I used to well i'm afraid of water. But in this summer I by a by a pool in just a portable swimming pool. And I. I have a lot chance to to swim me for my kids in in this holiday summer summer break. And I know how to light a. dry dry driving driving so. uh. So I feel I I somehow reduce the FIBA to to water.
383.0,Provider,Oh.
15322.0,Patient,"yeah so so many so I used to be when I jump and the water is not to do just in in my in sheer. All over put my. head inside. Even though insights not I when I I don't have great I will i'm easier to come out. But i'm afraid as well light light, I went to the water cover me and I will feel some something that was thinking and even though my I don't put my head in the water, just water in here. This thinking will always bother me oh inside or not inside inside or not you're saying so that. Will will will broaden the along well I in the water or close to the poor. But in this summer I, I feel I relax because I. I. prayed with my kids to in and and I used. Like that you do, do you know that, like the breathing me for. A goggle. Yes, so I I try and and I learned by myself how to pray with this free driving and the water. And I did around five minutes inside the water and. i'm out. Yes, so. It seems like I am. i'm I can pass over for that. So um yes so seems I I I. Somehow a little bit recover."
383.0,Provider,Good.
15322.0,Patient,"On this point. So. I think, because I. I can see that. When I mortar that's no longer be can be kill me."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15322.0,Patient,"I learned something that. I can beat that. So, so I have the ability to to in the water, but I can control it."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15322.0,Patient,So that's that's my sharing.
383.0,Provider,"Well that's really that's really good, I think that. The part of what you are doing is facing your fear. When we when we. We want to do it cautiously, but we want to face our fear. We want to face our feet and you what you do this with what you're describing Is this the water is instead of. going out of the water saying i'm not going to go in the water i'm too nervous in the water i'm not going to swim with my kids i'm not putting the mask on i'm not putting the you know snorkel on i'm too nervous about it. You you didn't do that you stayed in the water, you you even like you put the snorkel on. You you faced it a little bit, and you, you saw that you could you could be there, you could be there, and you weren't going to drown you know so that's really good you know and that's what we want to do, bit by bit, you know is. you're going to feel a little bit of fear and you're going to say, and then we enforce your safety i'm fine or you know, things are okay i'm good i'm i'm committed to my safety. And i'm committed to you know. Staying safe and then it's not like you're running away from what what you're afraid of. But you're also you're also checking in with yourself, because if you start having the crazy like what you say crazy thought meaning like go jump out the window you're checking in with yourself, because if you have a thought like that that's a dangerous thought. which you don't want to follow right. yeah. So, but the thing is is, if you. If and I don't know i'm still getting to know you if you some people they have some. Maybe they're hidden or some you know repressed desires to do some crazy stuff and there's ways of doing that safely like I just described, like you can go and you can sign up to jump out of an airplane. You know, with all the protection and and you can have that experience, if that was a repressed desire that you had i'm not sure that it is. i'm not suggesting that it is I don't know you know."
15322.0,Patient,hmm.
383.0,Provider,"So. I think that when you think about your safety. It and you, you do in you notice oh i'm locking the door, you know so that so that i'm safe i'm i'm going to this restaurant i'm going to this restroom that's. In a safe place I am you know choosing to drive and park in a safe neighborhood, these are all efforts that you are making to be safe, and so you can make you can continue those efforts when you're driving up a steep you know, a dangerous road you can stay in that spirit of protection. Any thoughts, sir."
15322.0,Patient,"i'm just think maybe I tried to. To thought that. The feeling of. i'm. When I. I used to be afraid. i'm deep in the water, but right now it's. it's far more recovered. it's a not too much fever, right now, so I. I think, maybe I can try to explain. More about the similar feeling. On. What when I when I trying a car in the world in. Not not not. not comfortable locations and. I may. pull out my. My memories on how. I can. How how how I can how the feeling well right now, when I close to a pool. Because I where it goes to a pool i'm no longer a fever right now. So maybe I can bring more similar feeling. Oh yeah on that."
383.0,Provider,"Right right and that's a good idea that's a good idea yeah that you are capable of having you know the pool thing showed you that you're capable of reducing your fear. So you're you're less fearful now narrow pool from what you're saying, then you used to be. Yes, so that shows you that you're capable of of reducing your fear So even if you're not ready yet to drive in an area where you feel is dangerous, you can tell yourself, you know, but I am capable of reducing my fear, so I can reduce my fear also and driving situation."
15322.0,Patient,Yes.
383.0,Provider,yeah is there any other situation where you feel like you do risky activities or or you do things that are a little bit my cause some. Do you do anything like any gambling or anything like that.
15322.0,Patient,What was gambling.
383.0,Provider,"Oh, like spending gambling spending money you know recklessly. Gambling I don't know gosh i'm sure there's a. translation for China and Chinese. let's see translate translate to English okay let's see etsy. Do Bo do Bo. d you be oh wait, let me see if I can do."
15322.0,Patient,"Oh Okay, let the casino. yeah no I don't I fall control the money I. i'm good for that. So i'm matt and my wife is a. it's want to spend money, so we can hold the money for a long time, so we find a way that what things can help you to to spend money a lot. So some weight you if you pay the money to your craft. Your your car. Then it's a waste, if you keep on buying a new car damage ways, but in in my culture, if you keep your money to buy a house. Then he the House oops will will will be like he's a valuation so. When you, you want to buy something you buy a house and then you will. You don't have extra money. So you so that's that's when you buy a house, you need to pay a law like Texas view and you use for remodel and you spend a lot of money and you. need to buy in your costco you want to buy something oh you by lighting you buy toilet paper shower door, so you spend a lot. yeah yeah for me i'm happy as well, you spend a lot of money and you're buying you you, you have this process but but you're not wasting money."
383.0,Provider,Right right. yeah maybe unless you spend a lot of money on a golden door or something like that.
15322.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, so as so it's a valuation in it can be put in the House, and when you eat for ran, you will have something to come back so that's that's what me and my wife's agreement on that for for how to spend money."
383.0,Provider,"I see good so you don't have any risky behavior with money. Correct that's good that's good um, are there any other areas where you feel like you have risky behavior besides what you described."
15322.0,Patient,"No, not not right now. height. Where the high location. Steel."
383.0,Provider,"Oh yeah yeah. well. Oh, do you feel like just having a conversation about it is helpful for you."
15322.0,Patient,"uh. So right now only have two times for that um. yeah let's move on and see was can, I think, somehow I it's it can approve at least I. Besides, you is not too many people can talk about this situation to others. yeah so yeah I think somehow he held me."
383.0,Provider,"Okay okay good yeah sometimes just having an opportunity to talk about it, because you don't keep talk because we don't talk about these things you know to everybody and. Just having the opportunity to talk about it, to look at it, to discuss the fine details, you know, like what you said about the swimming pool and. kind of getting more comfortable in the water, and everything all these little details are often we don't really open up and talk about so I think it's it's good to talk about it, I think that it is helpful, I mean I hope it's helpful for you, which is most important. And I think that maybe between now and our next appointment, if you can continue to think about and maybe write about. Your relationship to safety when you are going up like let's say you're imagining you're not doing it, but you're imagining like going up an elevator to like the 10th floor. And you're imagining getting out. And you imagine in your mind's eye. going to the edge of a building. And all the while you are not worried about throwing yourself off the side. is just in your imagination you're imagining it. You know you're imagining calmly going up you're imagining calmly stepping out you're imagining calmly just looking at the view it's so pretty so about high you know. And just enjoying the view and feeling comfortable and then getting back in the elevator going down and and leaving and all of it, without any worry. Just in your imagination just just having that those imagine you know, imagining that also in the car, you can imagine i'm driving in the car i'm maybe i'm going to lake tahoe. And i'm right on a cliff side and it's a it's a it's a dangerous road but i'm in control i'm feeling like I have you know i'm i'm calm i'm not. You know i'm i'm feeling protective of my family and myself and i'm just driving easy and Nice and slow, maybe I get out. To look at the view it's beautiful I get back in the car. So just in your imagination, maybe do a little, if you could do that maybe maybe once or twice before next appointment."
15322.0,Patient,Okay.
383.0,Provider,Just visualize yourself in your imagination.
15322.0,Patient,Okay.
383.0,Provider,"And, and maybe report back to me how that was for you."
15322.0,Patient,Okay.
383.0,Provider,"All right, Sam well let's make our next appointment then let's see here."

15322.0,Patient,"How about if I can, can we make a one more week because on that we can I, I will have a vacation with the family."
383.0,Provider,Sure sure yeah.
15322.0,Patient,You have a light shine your we have. So.
383.0,Provider,"yeah OK January 3 at five o'clock. Yes, Okay, do you want to make two appointments in January, the third and. I think the 24th is Martin Luther King Day. So maybe the third and the 24th."
15322.0,Patient,Sir enter the full okay.
383.0,Provider,"At five o'clock. Okay. Okay. Okay. And I just want to make sure you don't have any other appointments on those days. Okay, and. Okay, so I will see you, then, are you do you have a year okay with your medicine."
15322.0,Patient,"yeah Actually, I want to meet. chantelle as well, to see if I some some medicine can can have like like this malice right now the medicine can have achievement on the. On. On when I get in the street, that I feel no worse, but. When."
383.0,Provider,"When you when you get in the street. Can you describe, can you describe that a little bit more."
15322.0,Patient,"Yes, so. Like I say i'm. i'm. When my car try at the way the height, I used to be the contract or really high location. I would guess, I will have fear, but right now. When I eat the medicine if seems I try in the height location and good for that the most fierce location it's when i'm going to at that location. So the car train here so Oh, when I realize, I will be. fate going to a really high locations. And in that location is what the most fifth point. But when I cross this point i'm in the high location, I will say oh. OK, I train off so fear. Okay seems like it's a way for us to go over so. So I I say it's a. it's a some medicine can help me to. To not not at the point where is the in the high location, but it's it's coming up some something is going to affect me something coming up."
383.0,Provider,yeah.
15322.0,Patient,yeah you know why why why saying.
383.0,Provider,yeah I got the anticipatory anxiety your head if that anticipation and that makes that's very anxiety provoking. Do you do any deep breathing to calm your nervous system down.
15322.0,Patient,Oh no.
383.0,Provider,"So that's one there's something called box breathing so it's a deep inhalation and exhalation. it's a you can you can. Look that up online. it's. Taking slow deep breaths. You slowly exhale. And then you can. And then it's basically a slow inhale and exhale you can look it up online and maybe and. And they'll talk you through it, or we can I can actually. Show you here let's see. Okay hold on one second. Okay, so. Okay, you see my my screen here."
15322.0,Patient,slow.
383.0,Provider,Your breathing for four hold for four and then you breathe out for 41234 and then hold the breath for four. So breathe in for four counts see if this has volume. Can you hear anything not hearing anything.
15322.0,Patient,"not hear everything, but I know it's a free for second hold for a second. and break for a second and whole 474444 full."
383.0,Provider,"yeah. it's a very, very effective. When you are very anxious and you're starting to feel anxiety to, and then you can feel the cool sensation as you breathe them. feel the warm sensation as you bring up. All you're doing is breathing is feeling with breath and breathing very deeply. Does that make sense. Yes, yeah. So um. When when you starting to approach that anxiety you just start to do the breathing this breathing and you don't have to hold the breath if that if that gets too uncomfortable you can just dig deep inhalation and exhalation. But you want to feel it you don't want to just count it and not feel the breath."
15322.0,Patient,um.
383.0,Provider,"You know when you're swimming if you're swimming and you are doing, you know you're breathing in and breathing out. You know, in the swimming means. You are fully experiencing your breath when you're breathing. And you're swimming in the water, because if you don't breathe you're you know you have to do that and that's how you want to be that's how much you want to experience your breath when you are doing this breathing technique."
15322.0,Patient,Okay.
383.0,Provider,You want to really be feeling yourself breathing.
15322.0,Patient,Okay.
383.0,Provider,"So try that I hope you have a good holiday, are you staying in town, are you going on a vacation somewhere."
15322.0,Patient,you're going to occasion to big bear.
383.0,Provider,Are you going to big bear okay nice well there's gonna be some windy roads up there.
15322.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, so maybe maybe at this time, some someone and dry me feel so you have a big car so maybe to family and they drive it."
383.0,Provider,they're going to be driving okay.
15322.0,Patient,"But I I used to be try a lot of times. Although I afraid, but I I am my family is where they love to pray where do you love to go somewhere somewhere else to for vacation so. it's it's the one where the challenge. Where to complicate."
383.0,Provider,"yeah yeah well, I think that if you can, if someone else can drive for now that's probably a good thing, but while you are there, what you are in the car. you're practicing your breathing you don't have to tell anybody, you know you're just breathing and reinforcing that your safety and. That you're Okay, and that you protect yourself. Yes, yeah. Okay well have a very nice holiday."
15322.0,Patient,"Okay, you do."
383.0,Provider,"Thank you i'll see you on January. Okay okay take care bye bye. Okay. let's just keep risk assessment, the same we don't need to make any changes. I think the last note that I wrote I. The risk assessment was a low to moderate. Just based on all the same things that I said in the last one of you know impulsivity that there is some risk there, but I think he's making some progress so just keep everything the same from the last note, if you could. and We just that's my risk assessment for today there's really no changes. So thank you so much, if you have any questions don't hesitate to message me thank you."
