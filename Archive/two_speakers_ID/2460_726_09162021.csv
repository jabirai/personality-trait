726.0,Provider,"Oh, I don't usually get the message, it would be virtual clinic they were put it in your chart. um yeah but. yeah we're about to do a makeup and he says she's."
2460.0,Patient,They said that Isaiah doesn't have.
726.0,Provider,Know he's actually on vacation for the next two weeks so. You could ask them there's other groups that you might be able to drop in so it doesn't affect your chart and anyway um if.
2460.0,Patient,They told me.
726.0,Provider,"Oh, really."
2460.0,Patient,"I know, normally i'm able to fit that you don't need to be doing makeup groups about others."
726.0,Provider,Let me ask i'll ask my supervisor and see if he can go in another group. My.
2460.0,Patient,group today.
726.0,Provider,"yeah. Because they have different groups but they're in different time zones, sometimes like you're an Eastern time, like some of the people are in California Pacific time, so you have to kind of coordinate your time around, when they would be doing their group."
2460.0,Patient,hey do you turn the AC off. Here you turn the AC off. This freezing. So it goes 40 degrees in here.
726.0,Provider,"I appreciate you showing up to the appointment today to was an awesome. He they put you as a no show, so you said you called and cancelled."
2460.0,Patient,yeah I called it and hold it so that's.
726.0,Provider,"There, and just a quick question did you call once group had already started or did you call like way before the group actually started."
2460.0,Patient,It was like what group has started.
726.0,Provider,Oh that's probably why it's you have like I think you have to call us for the actual group starts if you're calling one of them starts already it's considered a no show.
2460.0,Patient,job I would what I gotta go walk off tell them like hey i'm a bit away from you guys because I gotta go call virtual clinic.
726.0,Provider,"yeah. So that's probably why it's put down as a no show, but just be careful because don't those affect a you already know that they're gonna affect your medication and how much you."
2460.0,Patient,make up.
726.0,Provider,"I would call again and just asked, maybe if it's somebody different maybe. Maybe. it'll be a different thing and i'll come and if they say that they don't do that then maybe it is really a policy that they have that you can't. um because yeah I know I say, is not here for two weeks so next week he's not here either. i'm Darren just so I can show you on your chart you're just missing one survey that's read. them that's the band."
2460.0,Patient,"Like I said I just like i'm kind of borrowed and phone when I took my certification with me he's like one, so he took my phone I was letting me why he was sitting in a stroller let me watch as low YouTube videos and stuff."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
2460.0,Patient,"To change, but I was riveted by poll, so he put my phone in the damn lake."
726.0,Provider,"And you get it like if it's through your email, can you get on the computer and evidence that."
2460.0,Patient,that's the thing I don't remember done it like I can't even get about Facebook nothing I don't remember.
726.0,Provider,"Seeing you. Can you try to figure it out, or at least call with virtual."
2460.0,Patient,yeah I could try to figure it out.
726.0,Provider,"Just because i'm. To the fact that you know show for group, and then you have that survey up that's going to mess up your chart with. The prescriber."
2460.0,Patient,What is it.
726.0,Provider,it's the BAM survey.
2460.0,Patient,Is the BAM.
726.0,Provider,Bam survey.
2460.0,Patient,i'll just. i'll see maybe i'll just make a new one simple just say that to that.
726.0,Provider,"yeah if you can just hop on any computer and just. If you're able to um. Our next appointment will be on the 30th. Okay, so try to show up and if you can't call way in advance, not the day of not 15 minutes after just call the day off or like before if you have to reschedule. or. Because your appointment is a 9am on the 30th so just make a note of it if you can put. Do you have your phone do you have a different phone he said. i'm trying to just write it down and put it on the refrigerator or something so you don't forget just so it's up there until you get a new phone that's yours, or are you going to keep this one."

2460.0,Patient,yeah they said there's something like a picture thing I could go to. ask you are these your friends you got label and stuff I haven't found that setup because we live by that setting I should be able to get myself. Because I know pretty much everybody oh yeah 2000 people on Facebook.
726.0,Provider,Well that's pretty cool because you're a coach so it's like you have you see a lot of faces all the time i'm sure.

726.0,Provider,"I get to know something new about you, each time because before I have no idea that you did any coaching and I had no idea did music that's pretty cool."
2460.0,Patient,little bit every cut hair tree resources.

726.0,Provider,"Well, I am confident that you'll succeed in in what you want to do because you're a key keep yourself busy, which is a good thing in in what you're doing so."
2460.0,Patient,"You ever good toby like r&b REP easy you just type, my name is."
726.0,Provider,"Well daring i'm just. I whenever you can have a know if you have time, but just talked to virtual clinic that's the one survey that you have to do it's the only one that's that's showing up and then. and ask again, I mean the worst they can say is no again, but just ask if you could drop in a class i'm sure there's another one somewhere that's running."
2460.0,Patient,i'm listening to you.
726.0,Provider,Oh that's okay.
2460.0,Patient,"But she wouldn't. understand why they wouldn't let me in it like for today, I said, what can I do tomorrow's class at noon. we're like well we're just gonna have. My one on one with you today. Though. i'm trying to get in the like i'm gonna try again but it's like the same person that was there yesterday so good luck."
726.0,Provider,"yeah it's funny because, as much as like i'm very much on the computer for a lot of the day for my individual sessions, but. Like the people in virtual clinic i've never met them in person like it's all through messaging and stuff like that so like the way that they do their part in scheduling or whatever like I don't know how they I don't know how you do it. Like the surveys I I don't even send those out I don't even know where I would do. That but they're the ones that send them out."
2460.0,Patient,or.
726.0,Provider,"Like I would have no problem sending them out, but I just that's not part of. yeah yeah."
2460.0,Patient,You. know what follow soon as I get off with you and see what what I can do.
726.0,Provider,yeah.
2460.0,Patient,"Sure, no turn deal with five and then have to go back again because it's not really about like though the quantity it's about having to deal with CBS every time you call. Because they really they don't really want to give people That said, you know what I mean so. yeah so like when you're when you're when I get a full script I only have to see them once once every other week or every week, you know. yeah instead of every three days, because you can hear it on their voices when you call and be like hey i'm calling my script and they'll be like what's your name very know who the Fuck it is you know. yeah and i'll be like. nah man, you know, and I mean it's just like. I know side to suck."
726.0,Provider,"yeah and what I would do like I know some people, you know if the group doesn't work that time in the assists sometimes for the most part, that it does, but those are the things that count against you on the system that mess up the your ability to get like a. Four weeks worth of medication which sucks. it's kind of like if I know some people that they're really good and there they'll do like. they'll schedule two appointments a month right off the BAT and they do it on the same day same week just every two weeks, and they just they just follow through and if, for whatever reason, they can't do it just call ahead. Call ahead and reschedule because that looks better than just not showing up, especially for the groups like the groups they're going to really be on you on the groups and if you're not showing up to the groups, then. they're going to see it as like someone that's having a difficult time, like getting involved and engaging their."
2460.0,Patient,Treatment into the groups. yeah or we ever miss for them to do that.
726.0,Provider,yeah. So.
2460.0,Patient,"Like I literally hard I think i've only missed like since I started doing this, like my third year so. I think i've only missed maybe to. Like for so."
726.0,Provider,"yeah I see i'm just looking at your chart the one thing you. The groups. And their end, but the individuals you've canceled a few times."
2460.0,Patient,"Good the individuals on this, a lot. about that."
726.0,Provider,"yeah so. So even literally there, even if it's a."
2460.0,Patient,"wonder scheduling oh no like. Those schedule those schedules, so far, a headache by time it comes time for me to do to my individuals or anything. I don't remember. Why why yeah. try to do it like two months ago, or a month to month before I even got to go see this person like. so far."
726.0,Provider,"I know you know what when you make your appointment, are you making that I I don't know who you had before So whoever you had before, maybe it was different situation when you schedule with me. When you schedule it put it on your phone immediately, because that I know what you're talking about because that's happened to me several times before. is like you make an appointment you're like oh my God I forgot I don't even remember that was a two months ago. I literally put everything on my calendar on my Google calendar and in I set a reminder, make sure that when we make our appointments you put it on your phone somewhere. Put a reminder, and since this isn't your phone write it down write it down so you will not forget that's, the only way that you'll be able to stay on track with it."
2460.0,Patient,"yeah we're so used to just remind me like what it got close like to like it'd be like a couple days before or the day before should be like a you. know you would leave tomorrow, are you got a one on one and that used to help your I mean."
726.0,Provider,Did you. Did you send to she sent it to you to write an email.
2460.0,Patient,"yeah she said that she said, actually text my phone."
726.0,Provider,Oh OK OK.
2460.0,Patient,"yeah she would like text, my father, let me know and just to remind me."
726.0,Provider,"Okay, all right. we'll figure something out but write it down not September 30 is your next appointment."
2460.0,Patient,or.
726.0,Provider,"Okay, and that's going to be at 9am. or write it down so you don't forget. And what i'll do is i'll try to send you a reminder okay. So when I look at my schedule for the day I will I don't have a phone where I can just text you, but I can email you a reminder of the appointment if that works."
2460.0,Patient,yeah it works.
726.0,Provider,"yeah and like I said I don't have any problem if you need to reschedule just do it ahead of time Okay, so I still get to see that we."
2460.0,Patient,Look at our.
726.0,Provider,"All right, please talk to group. Can. I will all right take care okay. bye. push the session."
