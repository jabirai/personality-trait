9655.0,Patient,hi.
540.0,Provider,hey.
9655.0,Patient,"Oh, my gosh a lot."
540.0,Provider,"Okay, all right so man."
9655.0,Patient,"well. It wasn't this this past Saturday, but it was sorry I had a miscarriage. Obviously, that I was pregnant. um I was really early apparently but I started I started cramping and I thought you know it's going to start my period and. Then I started thinking like well wait a second actually I should have started like a week ago. And then, but i'm talking about I was cramping so in my head, that I was like Oh, it must have been stress commonly well that was on a Friday, on the Saturday. I was like literally trying to see it up, and I was cramping so bad I couldn't even stand up and when I did finally stand up, it was just like a balloon of blood just busted out of me like everywhere. So I was like holy hell, I think i'm having a miscarriage so I called my Ob gyn and they said, you know if you feel light headed and things like that you need to go to the emergency room, so I did, and I went there and sure enough. Is that I was pregnant and but you know what's crazy is um. So they said they pretty much think my body care of itself, because they were talking about doing dnc which I didn't know what that was yeah. Well, I went back to the doctor, the following Monday here today. I went back the following Monday and they gave they took my blood and they give me another ultrasound she said that my uterine lining with good. and What she's after that. Okay, she said it look good, but then, and they took my blood my left well, then they call me what day they call me Friday. And she said, which would have been this last Friday, she said that my levels actually aren't going down so they want me to come back and. Monday, which I did just go back on Monday and they drew my blood again because she said, for some reason my hcg lever one down which they did say. When I when that had happened to me that there was like a one in a million chance that the baby could survive that but they highly doubt it. I don't know if that's what's happening or my levels just are."
540.0,Provider,Just not. realize.
9655.0,Patient,"Real quick yeah because I keep taking pregnancy test, and when I did it come native immediately, but I woke up the next morning, I decided to look at it and every team. Does that to me twice so it's like I don't think that they're still baby inside of me, but some reason."
540.0,Provider,"Well, coming up yeah just be on the safe side because there's always like very, very like rare chance, but a lot of times your body it's like the shocking system where. I mean it's a somewhat a traumatic experience for your body to go through so it's going to take some time for it to realize that okay i'm not creating a baby, especially the fact that your body has already created a baby. Okay yeah so your body will usually signal. I mean i'm glad that they're at least like looking at the levels, making sure that they'll monitor it."
9655.0,Patient,dollars to me says stress.
540.0,Provider,So how are you feeling about having and everything in between so was it has.
9655.0,Patient,"It was. OK and that's why I was like. In the thing is I every remember every time this happens to me believer and I swear my body just is not, but I was also on the on ramp friend I think that's what it's called and that's for the tuberculosis. He they said that might have been the reason why my body did that was because of that medication. Oh. Wait which i'm obviously still taking because I have to take that and. Honestly cassie I did not eat another baby I don't think that I could have the heart to get rid of it on my own. But. I are just to kind of feel like God stepped in that situation because. I can't imagine."
540.0,Provider,"kind of not took care of you and the circumstance, but looked out for you not."
9655.0,Patient,Yes.
540.0,Provider,To do and.
9655.0,Patient,Why.
540.0,Provider,Did you end up telling anyone around you that you had a miscarriage.
9655.0,Patient,I did like I ended up telling my mom because my mom knew I was in the hospital that day and I told Melanie here on take that I told Melanie. I mean well Melanie was actually there when all that stuff because i'm saying with her when I was like bleeding and stuff so. um. I just my mom was devastated you know she she would she hates the same you as a kid. she's just like you know we'll get through it thinking that i'm she's hoping that there's a chance that i'm pregnant.
540.0,Provider,or your mom is.
9655.0,Patient,"Yes, which I don't like you know that's most likely not pace, but. She just does your mom like know everything between you and him. Oh yes, she does, and I think about my mom is she tries to get me to move with her, which I have before but. My mom would be completely okay with me just living with her for the rest of my life and just either like childhood. yeah maybe they're my kids and i'm like I can't do that mom you know and there's not too much support because my mom and stepdad they still work every day all day."
540.0,Provider,Child Support. Brett.
9655.0,Patient,"And I can't really get a job things like that there so it's just easier for me here i've got more friends that are more available and. Right now, like I said i'm going to john family to get data. which I finally got turned in. This job was my friend's mom has taken. What. Can you hear me. hear me now. Okay. that the job with my friends mom for the. Aid and helping out with the."
540.0,Provider,house icon.
9655.0,Patient,"it's taking them forever like. Two weeks ago, you know when I told you like they had me my APP and I call me and set me up for an interview, the next week did that. Then they had me come to the House, but it's taking them literally like a week, at a time to just get one little thing done and i'm like at this point I kind of honestly I had another job. So, and they just now finally gave me my letter for dumped him services. And I have to have a little bit of lawyer to get. To get you. The third care so i'm I have to have something."
540.0,Provider,"Sorry, you looking at other opportunities now to."
9655.0,Patient,"I am i'm like I can't sit around waiting for the, this is the MMA not have time for but I need a job."
540.0,Provider,"And sometimes like you said, where some things happen, the way that they're supposed to so if say you're looking and say some other opportunities comes it may just be that that was meant to be versus that job. And maybe they'll I mean maybe they'll start kind of. fascinating things to get you, but like. I mean you have a lot depending on it."
9655.0,Patient,"Yes, i'm like you would think that because they're acting like so they're actually pretty much desperate for people but it's like you guys are so desperate and it's taken me they did just send me to four hour after take a for a cpr force. Okay i'm. just keep trying to intercept the occupy. it's okay. Are the four hour cpr course and there was some other training that I have to do this and, that being or said that you made an email. Which i'm going to start today. I mean it's always good because, like I said this is like a PM position so it's not. A set schedule, they send you shifts and you just pick up what you. want that's me i'm thinking, I was gonna pick up every day."
540.0,Provider,yeah.
9655.0,Patient,"They give you a bonus for. By $2 okay. yeah symbol and they don't wait until you get paid they put it into your bank account, the day after you complete. So I was like should all take it, but it's like pulling teeth getting in there."
540.0,Provider,"Sometimes, though those things that are worth the way oh it's you have to outweigh that too so. If I mean it's kind of Nice that they are taking their time with hiring you to because it shows the steps and all the work that it takes to get the job so that they're not just hiring job but."
9655.0,Patient,"I I felt the same thing, because I know it's like you are going to someone's home pretty much, and they have to be able to trust you and I wish I thought about that. It seems like it's gonna be a really good job I mean regardless if it's still going another job I can always still do that you know."
540.0,Provider,And you can go away and start something and really. it's it's it's not gonna be the worst thing for your resume to start something and then just switch to this other job once it gets going.
9655.0,Patient,yeah right.
540.0,Provider,"Right, how is that coffee date that you had."
9655.0,Patient,"Oh, my gosh I said that he was a sweet, I mean nothing like amused to was like into Superman. marvel and which I like stuff like that, too, but i'm not. But I will say he was the sweetest I still talk to him, he still comes in, like that, sometimes, but. I just didn't feel like it was. That type of relief yeah he'll you mean."
540.0,Provider,"I mean, it could be it. could be yeah yeah."
9655.0,Patient,"And, and we are like he has a two year old daughter that he raises by himself, which I thought was so sweet he's a good dad. And we like we've hung out still hang out get the kids together, so I did find a friend in it, which is awesome."
540.0,Provider,I think that's what's been so confusing like our society has really gone away from being able to like have friendships with the other sex where it's like you can have that.
9655.0,Patient,You can like my friend Melanie she's saying when she's like he's your boyfriend i'm like no he's really not she just can't believe that we hang out and it's not.
540.0,Provider,like that.
9655.0,Patient,"Like it's really not. But you know what maybe one day will turn into it, I."
540.0,Provider,"know they could have it that way, but. Sometimes that's like what makes it special is when you are friends and then it turns into more. yeah."
9655.0,Patient,"yeah I think the gym. And he's like his family's real Catholic so it's a big difference for me. Like how he lives and how I mean I thought it was amazing his parents, I think, better they're in their 60s and they're still together which you just don't see that too much anymore. I thought that was really sweet."
540.0,Provider,What happened with him and his X.
9655.0,Patient,"So pretty much. He said that he it was like a one night stand Cincinnati. And she ended up getting a hold of him which, when she did get a hold of him, she had a way. that she was just letting him know like you know i'm praying it I know it's yours and. So they've they've actually always co parenting and never had an issue but. Right now, the reason he's taking care of the kid by himself is because I guess she's been through a lot of her lifetime like was molested by her stepdad and things like that so she's kind of messed up. And right now she's trying to get her life together so he. told her you know work on you and i'll take care of the kid which is really nice to have that. So their friends, they get along I wish that was my case. And some plans it's."
540.0,Provider,"Sometimes, though it's it's better that it's not especially with your circumstance, with the toxicity of it."
9655.0,Patient,yeah.
540.0,Provider,Has he tried reaching out to you.
9655.0,Patient,"At all yeah oh yeah. So. My gosh Kathy. So I was at my house when I getting my stuff. And also, I did go Sunday and got. Like I brought a trailer and. want every day. So. Here, my mom play with this, you see keeps getting distracted for a minute that. um. So we're at the House one day right and him and that girl that he had a baby with. With our ancestors. he's walking over. for whatever reason. See like I told you before whenever I go over there it's always an attack situation if it's on the porch if his mom's on the porch somebody comes walking over which i'm like. You don't need to come over here and babysit me this is my house you but that's what they'll do they'll say that they're coming over to make sure I don't take anything of it yeah and i'm like Why would I do something like that, so you know she comes over and. She was for one getting in my face and on a hitchcock was but at one point I turned around and you need you know this girl should have grabbed my hair. Oh wow I before I could even control myself or turn around and punched her and she fell to the ground that's not like me i've never I think just of everything going on i'm kind of embarrassed that I did that but. i'm going through a lot and but everybody did see the whole situation so it's not like I just went crazy and I don't know what she was doing like trying to stop me from going in my own house, but in the COPs didn't get water nothing, no."
540.0,Provider,Did you see that it was her coming or.
9655.0,Patient,sister.

540.0,Provider,brown hold on so this girl is his the person that he got pregnant before right. yeah yeah.
9655.0,Patient,"So what they were doing was apparently she was bringing her son to fill over ashley's. And, of course, when bill sees me he's gonna run over, but she followed and actually came over to well the sickening part about this girl is she so twisted in the head that. The whole time that situation was going on there was like yelling you know. I don't talk to her and it's not even like that pretty much like telling me you don't talk to that girl, because he was thinking that I was thinking in my head Where are you with her. As I was not yeah. Like I did not care you guys weren't coming over to me all the time. You know I just lost the baby i've been stressed over the whole situation bill situation and I just couldn't believe she did that to me. But it's not out of her character, though she's always there was a few times, where she tried to say that she was banging on my door and told me to come outside and fighter and I didn't. person, yes, which that she has never done."
540.0,Provider,So bill knew about the miscarriage.
9655.0,Patient,yeah bill didn't know about the miscarriage.
540.0,Provider,"sister. Okay, how does sister did you tell the sister."
9655.0,Patient,"I told her sister which i'm kind of sad because she's going through IDF to get pregnant I don't know if I told you that. No, but like she's trying really hard to get pregnant and. When I was at the hospital, you know she had to come get kids and I told her what was going on, and she was trying to have a baby but. Stories stem from that that day that we got in a fight. She started yelling and she said, in the middle, in the midst of it and i'm not pregnant, because she was like pretty much saying i'm sorry you guys is shit. And i'm not pregnant they found out she can't have another baby and I heard her voice I break down and she said Okay, so I mean and I kind of feel like she believed that she didn't because of the stress that me and bill put on her, but I don't bring her into. I know I try not to he's the one like when I go over to get my stuff he and he calls her run over there, make sure she don't take my stuff I told her there's no reason to do that i'm not going to catch up. Here, to a."
540.0,Provider,One now now that you got all your stuff are you able to kind of like cut ties with him completely no.
9655.0,Patient,"Oh yes. Okay, I did. Just the fact of the miscarriage we have core, then you have some girl come across the street trying to grab me by my hair like. it's just so much with him. And then you have like don't don't keep my kids for me i'll tell his family that truth by this kind of see he's never even i've never had to keep the kids away from him because he's never even tried."
540.0,Provider,"Well done, you say that, like he'll use the kids to get close to, but that. yeah."
9655.0,Patient,"yeah in the past he's pretended like he wants to see them i'll bring them it's me me me. not paying them on to them, and since court he's not asked me a single time to get them. Or if he does Cathy if he does mention it like on a Thursday or something just randomly be like don't keep the kids for me please. I always tell them I don't do that, so I don't know why you say that, but here and he'll be like um well, I was thinking after the weekend, maybe on Monday or something it's always after he goes out or after he goes and does your mom. that she wants to see them when Monday or Tuesday rolls around he's not saying nothing about it. Today, stop baby here."
540.0,Provider,"You always want to just, especially with Court going on just make sure like you're saying any like voicemails that he gives like any. text messages."
