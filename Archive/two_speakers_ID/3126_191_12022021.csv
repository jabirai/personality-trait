3126.0,Patient,"yeah there is, but you can't."
191.0,Provider,So you don't want any closer follow up.
3126.0,Patient,Okay.
191.0,Provider,Okay.
3126.0,Patient,well.
191.0,Provider,Please call me back okay.
3126.0,Patient,yeah.
191.0,Provider,"Right like Okay, thank you. Okay, so transcriptionist please document this patient presents today purpose, a meeting. She wanted treatment with for ADHD she reports sessions previously on adderall she says she's been filling forgetful and not completing her task and she's been feeling overwhelmed she does support the feeling that she feels depressed. When I talked to her about having close to follow up. She declined it so clearly there is a lot going on with miss Christine. She admits to. Using heroin her reason for you in heroin reason for using heroin is boredom she says she spends her days sitting in her room. So try to learn more about that currently she's not receptive will follow up with her about that she did admit to using heroin and when she use the heroin that she will not use the people morphing. She later also admitted that she may take one additional. buprenorphine so we're getting several in consistencies. peel countless failed failed peel camp, please put that in all caps or she reviewed patient last picked on up on 1126 two reports that she started her medications on 1126. She has had eight days of medication so her last dose should have been on 12 three as she will be ready for pickup on 11 for. So today is 1112 to what she was due to pick up on correction 24 star she's due to run out on 12 three different pick up on 12 for today is 22 so she should have at least had two more pills, but there, there were no medications there. Are pill bottle was empty. So that's a fail pill count so patient was requested to go to in person lab we will be looking at the beautiful view ratio and she's aware she needs to do that and 48 hours. Because for a couple reasons one uds was negative for buprenorphine as she admitted to not taking a buprenorphine first couple of days and then also she filled account today. My concern is the heroin use we definitely suggested that she not use the heroin, because the concerns for increased risk of overdose uds and OPS October was positive for cocaine she denies use of cocaine, the concern is or safety we're dealing with some mental health issues. But right now she doesn't appear to be receptive to treatment, I did ask her to follow back up with me to address the insomnia. But right now she's not a candidate for another control substance do want to confirm House if she's using her people morphine regularly history does report shows multiple miss urine drug screens also okay in a dictation. Sorry, so revisiting the care intensity recommendation. She needs to go back to weekly groups monthly urine drug screens at least twice a week with her therapist and at least monthly with me additional additional support was offer please document she declined closer follow up in the dictation."
