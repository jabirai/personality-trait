226.0,Provider,My MTV. hey caitlin. How are you yeah.
11558.0,Patient,Just a little tired.
226.0,Provider,"Oh, did you just wake up."
11558.0,Patient,Oh yeah just a few minutes ago.
226.0,Provider,"Well, you see me dear appointment."
11558.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
226.0,Provider,Have you been working a lot.
11558.0,Patient,"Of i'm kind of yeah because the job that I picked up at a bakery is full time since i'm not in school, yet so like last night, I had a full eight hour shift so just a little tired."
226.0,Provider,"Oh, how do you like that top."
11558.0,Patient,"Honestly, I really enjoy it it the OK, so the way that it works there, we have a mall location and since the the shop there is really small. And we just get stuff sent in from the main store so only one person works there and at first, I thought. You know because I like working around people and everything I didn't think it would be like a good setting for me, but it's actually really nice because. I just you know, like it's just me interacting with customers and I get time to myself, without being alone, you know."
226.0,Provider,"So. Is that the one. Okay that's the one at the mall that's the location where you work someone at the mall. Yes, okay yeah. So. it's not so crazy, but you know, like you're just not wrong all the time, so it's it's kind of sounds like a balance between like customers and then you can take a breath."
11558.0,Patient,"yeah it is, and I feel like it's good. For me, because. Like they're starting to train me in the main store, you know, in case because they're there are very few employees, so in case I get called in there they're training me there so that I, you know I know. How to work in that setting and it's a little busier there and I work with another person so that part kind of. gets me anxious because I started my training there and I noticed that just with how fast paced it is um. it's a little hard for me to keep up, then it gets a little frustrating and I get a little anxious, but you know, like if I ever need help, I just know that I can ask someone and if i'm really having trouble, then you know we'd figure something out so yeah."
226.0,Provider,Okay. So how are you feeling I carry things How are things going otherwise.
11558.0,Patient,"um I sometimes. i've noticed that recently i've kind of been getting like. i've been in my head a lot like if i'm not at work or if i'm not hanging out with my friends, since I don't have school like like that normal routine anymore. You know. Like I I was forced to have that as a part of my routine for most of my life and then all of a sudden, he became my choice to not have it so it's been like. that the transition that I didn't realize, I was going to have to go through, since I didn't think I was going to go straight to college after high school, so it was kind of one of those things where I realized that. Because i've been dealing with my depression, for years now and i've you know, like I didn't plan on getting this far, I guess, like I didn't really have. A real plan and not like not like I can't figure out anything now you know but it's just I start getting into that whole thought process of. Oh, I had these big dreams and I could have achieved them if I didn't you know, like get so lost and feeling this way not like, and I know that it's still possible for me to. You know, things just didn't go how I expected, but if I if I really wanted to them, I could apply to the schools that i've always wanted to to go to it's just like when. Everyone else was was going through this process, I just had to deal with another thing on my own so i'm i'm trying to to get used to the fact that. Like that's my reality now is that, like all my friends are going to like the ucs and everything and then I just have to not compare my situation to theirs, because we went through very different things, and so."
226.0,Provider,"yeah and. You know you just weren't sure that you wanted to do the College thing right now yeah. That was. You know, even when I first started working with you, you know that was not something that was a. year ago at that time right. yeah That was something that you were going to come out shelf and think about. Oh yeah you're right, you know it's like you can't compare yourself to other people it's not fair to do to yourself."
11558.0,Patient,Because.
226.0,Provider,"A circumstance so really different. yeah and you're right, you were dealing with some things that other people aren't dealing with at that time and know your focus is getting your mental and emotional you know, health or you want. me know and and you've done a really great job I mean think of how far you've come. So yeah I think those kind of staying out of that comparison. comparison is never a good thing. And then you know yeah it's a little different right, so your whole. You know, for happier life it's been scheduled for you, but. yeah it's like he didn't have a choice."
11558.0,Patient,"yeah exactly. And then, like recently my my mom and I have been getting into arguments more because. The that nursing program that I was planning on doing. it's coming up like orientation is next month, and then. The entrance exam was in November and i'm still debating whether or not I want to do it because I think I still want to, I want to take more time to. To just work and save up some money, so that if I decide to go back to Chicago my mom can't use money against me because I realized that that's really the only thing that you know she had. um and then there were just certain things like i'm. So so since most of my since my whole family lives in Chicago my grandpa lives with my aunts and uncles and so, then my mom messaged me the other day, and she was. She asked me, she was like. Oh, is it Okay, if he stays with us for a few months i'm around November until April and i've never been against that, because you know, like it's my grandpa I want him to. be able to stay with us and you know we can help him out, and you know, like but it's just the fact that my family. All my aunts and uncles in Chicago they all have like these big houses with extra rooms and it's a little bit more comfortable for them to have an extra person living with them. And then over here, you know, especially because everybody's usually get outworked and then i'm just the only one at home and i'm not necessarily super close with my grandpa and you know he since we don't have the extra room he has to stay in my room, and I say downstairs is just. You know, like like he's my grandpa i'm not gonna say no, but just me being you know 18 year old girl, I want to have my space, and in my room when. If i'm sleeping in the living room or you know, like on the phone with my friends in the living room like it just doesn't feel like I have that privacy, that I want so. You know, and then my mom was. When she was talking about how long he would stay she like she would mention the nursing school and everything and then so she she was basically like so around the time your school starts. And to me that just didn't make sense, because you know, like you would think if anything that would be the time that I need my own space and to be able to focus especially because she knows like how well because the program is difficult in general, and then you know me not really. liking, this whole school thing like yeah I don't know I, and then I did I did tell her like that I felt uncomfortable with the fact that. That he would just that he would stay that long. I guess you know, like five months is it's a pretty. Pretty long time and a lot can happen, five months, so you know yeah and that that's if you were to come during the time that i'm in school that's that's. that's about half of the program already. So. yeah I I told her you know it didn't seem fair that. Because there were other options, she said that you know her and her siblings were talking about where he would be able to stay next. And then I I did mention how I was feeling about how they all have a bunch of extra room and. it's just easier for him to to be there, and he said he's told me that himself to that you know traveling all the way here, especially. You know, during coven and then to stay here for five months, and he doesn't even have most of this stuff you know, like, I feel like there's this unsaid thing where we're both kind of uncomfortable but it's just become. like this, this thing that my mom and her siblings have have decided instead of you know, it was kind of one of those things where um I feel like my mom didn't really think it through and she brought it up to me, because she asked me if it was Okay, as if, like."
226.0,Provider,I asked.
11558.0,Patient,"Why, she was asking, but you know, like I don't really have a choice, so I would have rather. Her I would have rather she told me, you know, like oh he's gonna stay here and then maybe my reaction would have been different. Instead of her asking if it's Okay, and then I know that I don't have a choice he's going to stay in my room he's gonna you know, like his quotes are going to be in half my closet you know, like that kind of stuff."
226.0,Provider,So his grandpa where sustain right now.
11558.0,Patient,"um he staying. Here he's been Okay, because they're living situation before um one of my aunt lived in my grandparents house with him after my grandma passed away so that they could. Like clean up the House a little bit and get it ready to be sold since they've they've been living there, since they moved here to America. And so, then after they moved out after that aunt of mine got a house for her own family, my grandpa has been staying. With my uncle. And he's been living there for the past few months, and he, like it's not just like when he comes here or goes to another one of my aunts. Like my other ox house where he just brings like a few of his stuff and everything like he has his own room there like there's he has a bed and a dresser and everything all of this stuff is there and so yeah like I understand why, like that they want him to. To. The way my mom explained it to me was that they. They would have like their fair share of helping him out and like giving him a place to stay and everything but I don't know to me I just didn't understand it, because he has. Like he's living there, you know, like he's not he's not just going house to house and everything, and I also noticed that it wasn't you know my mom never told me Oh, I want to spend time with him type thing because, even when he's here, you know, like her routine doesn't change he's. she's still at work. And everything so. yeah that that was really the only thing that. kind of confused me is that it wasn't that she wants to. You know, spend time with him or anything or wants us to spend time with him is just that she felt obligated, even though I know that he doesn't like he doesn't necessarily. want to be going to each of their houses and everything. So yeah."
226.0,Provider,So um. Is he is his grandpa in Chicago or is he in La.
11558.0,Patient,"Oh yes, he's in he's in Chicago."
226.0,Provider,"got it. And you know also I was gonna say if you were to do that, then nursing program you know they're. Just kind of tie you to La even more."
11558.0,Patient,"yeah because I. I brought up fear the idea to my mom that I mentioned. I think it was the last time we had an individual session, where I would go to Community college in Chicago instead of here. And then you know I brought it up to her kind of casually I didn't want to make it a whole big things, because then you know she would. She would have the chance to to just like take it away from me like very quickly, so I kind of just brought it up in the like in a in a conversation just let into it um I was, I was kind of just say. Oh yeah you know, like the I felt very comfortable the past month that I was there I was just listing all of the benefits of you know, like of how. of how I was when I was there and then I said it would be. You know I feel like it it's it's an option for me to to go there and go to the Community college and a few of my cousins go there as well, so. You know, like I would start off knowing a few people. And just just being there like it's not like i'm running away to some state that i've never been to and I don't know anyone there you know, like I. They said that they would help me. Like get comfortable until i'm able to you know live on my own or live with one of my cousins you know, whatever it may be, and then she kind of just said, like she she didn't really. it's like she wasn't really listening to everything that I was saying, because all she heard was. going to school anywhere but here. based, though, and so she she was just like Oh, but it's the. same as our Community college and i'm like well you know. If you if you think Community college, you know it would be the same for for any place but it's like it's different it's a different it's a totally different setting you know it's not. yeah yeah."
226.0,Provider,"Well, I mean I like that idea of you know, working to save some money and. yeah now that. You know cuz the money gives you independence Monday."
11558.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"You know that really it changes it, you know where you're not having to go to your mom to say hey look I need money to move to Chicago or. yeah you know, like. You know, so I think that that I dia might be to look at like So if you are let's say. You know, we talked about maybe in the next year right. You know the next year say you're planning on moving to Chicago. You want to have that trip fully funded yeah. You want to be able to pay for. That and more you know, like your. Money like we're like we're there and then it would take you a month or so, to find a job you want to have that money like yeah you know. So it's kind of like budgeting out what it would. kind of stuff because. you're right, you know, then your mom's can't really say that well, I mean she shirt shirt and I can say no. yeah you can say well. i'm going, you know."
11558.0,Patient,"yeah because even even though, even though my my family, because when I was there, they they through like a Grad party for me and so. Like a lot of my family was there that I haven't seen in a while, and even the ones who didn't know that I even had ideas of going there for college, they were just like if you need help if you ever move here. You know, we can. We can help you out, and you know, like even, even though I have that option, like, I still want to be comfortable on my own to so that. You know, because I know that they all have families have their own you know laughs at their own So even if they're willing to help. A little bit I don't want to have to rely on them either or put any stress on them that that isn't necessary but yeah um. And there have also been because I mentioned in group that my friends have noticed that i'm kind of like falling back into that feeling so they've been trying to get me out and everything, even if we're just just hanging out and so. This kind of started as a joke, a few years ago where my friends and I were like Oh, what if we just all live together, whatever because. there's this this group of some of my closest friends that are staying here for college they're going to the Community college. And so just recently we we really thought about it and they kind of have the same idea as me where we're just like will work for a little bit and then we'll we'll get comfortable. On our own you know, like just work for a little bit. And then we'll we'll get comfortable with with our with our money to if we needed to even just get a place here on our own, just so that we're not stuck at home, like. You know just just a small place for us to stay at where we we feel safer around each other and everything and we've we've been looking into places, you know the cheapest, but like safest and everything, just so that we get the experience of. You know, like living on our own where we'd have to learn to budget our money with with paying bills and going out, you know, trying to. To have that balance and then whenever you know, like, for me, my situation is different, a few of them are in school and working while i'm just working so. Like we were figuring out like certain chairs and everything, and this is a group of people that even like our parents, we all. All of our parents, you know, like everyone in the group and we know that we consider each other family, because when we're not with our family or with them, we spend more time with them than our family so. I you know that's also one of my options, and I feel that, if anything, if that were to be a transition for me to move, you know, instead of. Like because I think that, even if I were to move out, you know because we we don't plan on going far obviously we would stay at least within the city. Just to you know I would be home every weekend or something to to show my mom that it isn't me running away is just me wanting to get away for a little bit and then i'll come back and you know, I just want to learn to. To. Be more independent, in that way and i'm glad that I have options to do so in a in a in a more comfortable way, then you know, like doing it completely on my own. um so yeah there's a lot to it but."
226.0,Provider,"So. So, are you anticipating that your mom would have issues with you, moving it so, is it is it that your mom would really have difficulty with you just moving out, no matter where you move out."
11558.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah."
226.0,Provider,"Is that so caitlin is that is that, like kind of a cultural thing to wear. Are you are, you are you expected to stay home till a certain. Age i'm just curious."
11558.0,Patient,"yeah. So in Filipino culture in general, well, I guess, like Asian culture in general it's you know, like multiple generations would live in the same House, I think, and then. The children would help. help their parents as soon as they can. yeah um but ever since. Ever since my mom and her family moved to America they they've kind of been. They haven't really been following that I guess, because you know, like their grandparents were in the Philippines and everything and so we've we've kind of sorry we've kind of been. they've kind of been straying away from like traditional um. I guess traditional um. ideas regarding like living situations because, like I said now they're they've all all of her siblings have moved out into their own homes. she's she's the eldest so she they didn't have a problem with her being the first to move little to like another State so um. yeah we it's not really a thing that we've talked about like like I know for a lot of American families it's like once you're 18 you're out you're doing your own thing, whether that be your choice or you get kicked out, you know. So. we've we've never really talked about it, but all I know. Is that. When it has come up it's always been. In in the way that you know she talks about my brother's situation where he's 25 and he had trouble with his first few first few years of college so he's staying. Here, while he's while he's finishing up his nursing program until he's able to get comfortable, but when my mom would talk about it, she would be super negative about it she's like Oh, you really thick because I would I would mention, or I would bring it up i'd be like Oh, what if. What if my brother and I, you know, like we move out and live together type thing you know, and then you UN dad can move to a smaller place so that you don't have to. pay, like so many bills and everything and you don't have to have all of this stress and think that you have to work every single day, you have to work all two jobs to. See you know just just to put a roof over our heads, because once were. ones were capable of doing it, then you guys can think back off of work a little bit you know. And then she would just be like Oh, you know your brother's 25 and he still. He he still barely has a job, blah blah blah you really think you know he's going to move out soon and then she kind of say the same thing about me. she's like Oh, you know, like what you went through like who, who would have been there for you like you think you're going to move out soon type thing. And i've just you know it's like she It makes me feel like she doesn't believe that we can we can live on our own, and you know whether that be when we're 18 and 25 or like 30 I it."
226.0,Provider,It just I think it's more honestly I don't think it's I think it's she's afraid because she knows you can live on your own.
11558.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,She does not want you guys.
11558.0,Patient,"Living yeah exactly and that that's why i'm. I really want to get. comfortable with my money. So that if I. so that I can just leave and she she can't you know because I did notice that when I would bring it up like I got one point, while I was in Chicago and she was still here before she had flown out there um. We were on a facetime call and I was with my art and I was just telling her about how much I love it there, and everything and. And all that and then my aunt was jokingly like yeah she can stay with us, or you know, like."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
11558.0,Patient,"She went to. On our side of the conversation, but then to my mom and it seemed like a joke so she's like yeah she can she can live with us. Until she's able to find a place or her and her cousin are able to find a place and then my mom was just like okay well you know if you move there then. You know you're not going to have your car because i'm paying for the car you're not going to have it, you know, like she anything that she would say about it would always be about money, and so I, I know that that's like my loophole that's my way out."
226.0,Provider,"Right absolutely. So. You know you just have to you know stick to a plan that works for you, you know follow your heart follow your instincts. Know you've got. You know. You know just keep using those coping skills keep focusing on your mental and emotional health, you know. Get stronger and stronger. you're going to have days, where you don't feel great you're going to have weeks at feel sucky you know. Remember it's just. it's it's like the ebb and flow of life right. there's upstairs downstairs good weeks or sad weeks right, so you know, the goal is to just kind of get it straight in the middle, so your highs are high in your those aren't mo. yeah and. you're just kind of cruising along and you're doing what you need to do and you're you're setting goals and you're reaching those goals and you set more goals and. You know that's how you gradually build self esteem that's how you build your bank account that's how you get to where you want to be. So this doesn't happen overnight I love that it's a year. Like a year plan. Yes, super realistic. Really healthy I think that's really smart. I think it's like what you're talking about it's like learning how to manage and budget your money you know you're like Okay, could we could move in together, this is what it would you know, doing the legwork the research on that. But you should be doing, you know, and if you don't want to go to school, right now, then. It doesn't work and that's what you do you know you don't. You stay true to yourself. Right yeah when you're not able to stay, true to yourself that's when things start to go sideways. So it's remaining true to yourself, and what makes you happy you're an individual or competent you're intelligent. can do this, your mom's going to be, you know."
11558.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"She just as because that's that's just your mom and. that's what she was going to do so, you have to kind of be able to you know blocks in the that out. And just kind of just take it as it comes."
11558.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, all right good. So um. Do thursday's usually work for you."
11558.0,Patient,um let me check yeah Thursday mornings are good time.

226.0,Provider,"So gotcha on Thursday September 23 at 9am. All right, so anything else that you want to go over. or."
11558.0,Patient,"No, not really that's really just been what's on my mind lately. Okay yeah."

11558.0,Patient,Thank you.
