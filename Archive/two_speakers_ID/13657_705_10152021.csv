Oh, and I thought you know that's really neat and creative how she made that her own because then other people don't even know and helps your calm down and reprove."
13657.0,Patient,yeah yeah I like that too.

705.0,Provider,OK.
13657.0,Patient,yeah. yeah it's been really good again like I still can't believe it.
705.0,Provider,Hard work. dedication try it. out new out of the box.
13657.0,Patient,mm hmm yeah it's it's really. yeah. When i'm reading a new book about bipolar. called unquiet minds.
705.0,Provider,i've tried it on.
13657.0,Patient,"yeah it's it's really good it's like reading my life story it's yeah and it's about a psychologist who went through it is is. manic depressive and well that was you diagnose manic depressive back in the 70s. mm hmm and. they'll managed to get her PhD and got so far, even in the throes of it when she wasn't she didn't think anything was wrong with her and she had all the highs and all the lows and. yeah so she talks about that and it's really it's really good but."
705.0,Provider,"I will have to definitely check that out, I love resources like that and it's nice when you can read something and it's like oh okay."
13657.0,Patient,Here yeah yeah I.
705.0,Provider,"get it, I get it. that's."
13657.0,Patient,"No, I don't know yeah you know I don't talk a lot in. group they hard for me to talk about like I always feel bad because you know a lot of people are like a lot of the group is like going through so much. Right now, and my my life is like good and I kind of don't want to really brag about it or feel like i'm bragging about it, you know so yeah kind of just skim over how how good i'm doing but yeah."
705.0,Provider,"Just for you know to Karen is you're not the first person that shared this with me they're like I don't know what to say during updates and it's like. yeah feel comfortable it's actually really healthy for the group. To hear that you are doing well, because it gives other people hope when they feel so hopeless."
13657.0,Patient,yeah yeah that's true i'll try i'll try to do better.
705.0,Provider,You know you do what you feel comfortable with. To me it's just coming in it's already a big win if you attend group big one.
13657.0,Patient,yeah yeah and I have a hard time group because it's so early in the morning and yeah I mean usually just rolling out a bit we're still in bed when I come in so. yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Now that you're back to work to Karen and looking at the care intensity like right now, it shows weekly groups do you feel the support weekly is what you need or do you want to lower it."
13657.0,Patient,I think I want to lower it. yeah definitely lori it will be better for me.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, what twice a month for group and twice a month for individual workout."
13657.0,Patient,yeah yeah I think that would be better.
705.0,Provider,"So I were talking i'm going to go ahead, then and change this and I will. Share because I know. Others also have like a work or school conflict so that's what I will share. For. And then i'm going to change it. Twice a month. At any time now, if you need more support. You can just let us know and just because, like let's say it's twice a month, but you feel like one month, you need. three sessions that come in and that's fine."
13657.0,Patient,"Okay, that sounds good, I like that."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, good, and in this way, too, because sometimes if there's other appointments and life gets busy, then it lowers where sometimes you can only have so many of the medication and then they'll bridge you until the next appointment. So this is a good tool that you and I can work together to get it at something that's going to be more beneficial for you at this time."
13657.0,Patient,Okay.
705.0,Provider,"Good so that is changed, and then. let's see to it looks like so, then you and I are meeting today and, if you like, to I can schedule so two times a month and two times a month if it gets to where to your reengage back into work and you would feel supported to with one month, and let me know when. For right now, then, if we're doing the twice a month, is there a certain day of the week, that I should look at."
13657.0,Patient,"Thursdays and Fridays are my day off So those are the best. Best days. Okay yeah and if that doesn't work then Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, I can do anytime before noon."
705.0,Provider,I will probably have something on a Thursday or Friday. I look at let's see. So we could either go the 22nd or the 29th.
13657.0,Patient,"Well, let."
705.0,Provider,me see what's the. i'm just switching over real quick back to the 29th to see if there's more. Timing there. On the 29th. It looks like I would have and that's a Friday. October the 29th I could do Karen it looks like. 132. or four o'clock.
13657.0,Patient,Okay.
705.0,Provider,"I can do the 131 38 is. Okay, so 130. And if for any reason, like if you're covering someone shifts or something just let me know I, are you can do you have the text number, where you can communicate with your."
13657.0,Patient,"chatting ill. No, I don't."
705.0,Provider,"Okay i'm gonna are you on your phone by chance, or."
13657.0,Patient,I have it with me.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, so the number i'll give it to you and i'll write it in the chat to. Okay, and. It is going to be, and this is a text number, you would just put check checking in. It would be 415-458-2688."
13657.0,Patient,All right.
705.0,Provider,"And so you can just say checking in sometimes to them, I ask for your date of birth, just to verify that issue."
13657.0,Patient,It yeah.
705.0,Provider,"If there's like a copay sometimes too, you can talk to them about putting a credit card on file if you feel comfortable with that."
13657.0,Patient,Oh yeah I already i'll.
705.0,Provider,"So. i'll kinda yeah so. What i'm going to do, then, is i'm going to book them where no one else's sometimes I what I found is why a meeting to go ahead and book your next appointment, just in case. If someone's looking at the same appointment time they won't be able to. Get that."
13657.0,Patient,Oh OK.
705.0,Provider,And this is just coming. To the 29th and with said the 130 is going to work for you.
13657.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,So I know you said sleepers is going well how about.
13657.0,Patient,"appetite yeah. update good I definitely changed a lot of my diet and try to stay away from processed foods. at work, they have a lot of healthy options, so I actually eat one of my brakes i'll eat vegetables and hummus. And some like some protein little bit of cheese some meats, and then usually my second break i'll have a salad and that's pretty much I mean i'll eat breakfast but other than maybe having a snack when I get off work and home. yeah that's pretty much all I eat which. seems to be enough so."
705.0,Provider,What you're describing all of it i'm like hummus it's like not. Only thanksgiving is healthy.
13657.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
705.0,Provider,"I know, sometimes it's like having Coca Cola and drink it, you know eating more junk food and you feel sluggish are you noticing any rewards yet."
13657.0,Patient,"yeah definitely knows the rewards so yeah i'm staying awake well I drink I stopped drinking soda years ago. Probably going on 10 years like everyone's well I want the bubbles so i'll get like a just a small amount, and then that usually curbs that little bit of you. would have or a little bit of that that that need. So, and then, if I do want more bubbles like an actual drink i'll get soda water some lemon."
705.0,Provider,Another adjustment you're like okay come come at me I got this.
13657.0,Patient,"yeah I got this I got yes definitely. yeah yeah of course i'm drinking soda water it's all a drink at work is water. I did I did drink like an energy drink which i've been weaning myself off limbs I used to drink them all the time, oh graveyards. So I drank one on Wednesday, that was. Day three of work, and I was really tired, so I just drink half one and that I through the rest away."
705.0,Provider,yeah and again monitoring and knowing that that was satisfying and you didn't have to do the whole pan and.
13657.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
705.0,Provider,that's annoying to sensitivity to the caffeine.
13657.0,Patient,"Oh yeah yeah though definitely so i'm going to try to. Bring tea like hot tea with me to work, hopefully once it cools down a little bit. But i'll probably make my own ice so with like green tea so it's a little bit more that healthier natural caffeine, instead of though you know artificial."
705.0,Provider,"Right, I know for myself with the caffeine it's really a difference of what you may get in a Coca Cola versus a tea."
13657.0,Patient,"Yes, definitely I don't get jittery. On the on the natural. Like tea is and stuff so that definitely helps."
705.0,Provider,"yeah the drinks, the energy drinks are you talking like a monster drink or something."
13657.0,Patient,I drink bang usually so which is they call it the healthier. healthier energy drink because it's got amino acids in it and kind of like it also works as a pre workout so yeah so it's a it's a pretty potent potent draped so definitely I know I need to quit them okay.
705.0,Provider,"yeah exactly what you. To me, you already know. Like the recipe where you're not getting jittery it's like okay i'm tired. A little bit of this."
13657.0,Patient,me yeah. yeah so yeah a lot of changes and they've all been really positive so yeah.
705.0,Provider,medications to them for like their therapeutic levels.
13657.0,Patient,"mm hmm yeah medications been really good i've been able to drop some weight, for you know. Being on a different medication, been the abilify that was making me gain weight and the main reason why I stopped taking it. So i've dropped a little bit of weight oh i'm sure i'll drop a little bit more working so I just been at home, the last three months so yeah."
705.0,Provider,"And that is hard and we don't realize when we're at work, we run around so much and it just helps maintain way."
13657.0,Patient,yeah oh yeah it really does know.
705.0,Provider,How often The other area with you know more of the mental health with any thoughts of self harm or anything come up.

13657.0,Patient,"yeah yeah i'm very, very much like look out for myself. And if i'm not. You know, you know my you know friends get a little bit worried that i'm doing a little bit too much you. know I can trust that they'll. they'll say something to me, and they won't just let me go, so a lot of times, if I get you know hanging out with. The groups that I was hanging out with now that anybody would really pressure me to do anything, nobody does that, and you know, our group. But they won't you know say hey you're you know it's too much down like you need you need to bring it back in like they just don't care like they care, but they don't really care."
705.0,Provider,"And it's Nice, like the gentleman, you were talking about like it's Nice that he could be open with you. And that you also come back with us, you know, and maybe that's a goal down the way that you might find yeah more than you don't need it, if you go."
13657.0,Patient,"out yeah exactly and that that really is ideally, what I want to get to, and I think i'm pretty sure i'll get there, so."
705.0,Provider,"Again it's a lot of it is just monitoring, if you catch yourself or two drinks is coming more like three or four then let's talk."
13657.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah exactly so yeah yeah it's definitely definitely a turnaround like it's i've done the work i'm surprised that i've been able to make it, you know when. all hell broke loose in my life by I didn't think I get to this point."

13657.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, so yeah. Basically yeah everything has been. amazing. So I am I think I brought it up in group. I am having nightmares and I know that's one of the side effects of one of the medications i'm taking. I can't remember which one it is it's always my nighttime one, if I remember correctly, and then one will give me livid drink or vivid dreams. And so you know some of the times i'll have the really vivid nightmares and i'll wake up wake myself up and sometimes it will take me a little while fall asleep i'll have to read for a bit. Late do eventually fall back asleep."
705.0,Provider,Is it the trials at all.
13657.0,Patient,I think so.
705.0,Provider,"As I see here, where you take it before bedtime."
13657.0,Patient,"yeah yeah about two hours before bedtime. Right yeah and that that also helps me sleep by fall asleep really quick. After taking it usually i'll take it says two hours but normally i'll take it right after work now right after work and and i'll be asleep within 45 minutes. And it's really good sleep, you know about 90% of the time, so I have that little bit of 10% that I do have the nightmares and. they're so weird like it'll be like nightmares that if I don't completely wake up i'll just and I kind of fall back to sleep i'll go right back into the nightmare it won't it won't stop. So yeah so unless I completely wake up and and open my eyes and actually be like okay was nightmare and just yeah just read for it like reading helps because it takes my mind off bit and then and kind of clear my mind and fall back to sleep and it's rest up restful sleep so."
705.0,Provider,And switching gears on your brain where it feels like reality and try to ground yourself where it's like no that's not what's happening right now.
13657.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. A lot a lot of the night, most of the nightmares are like fiction like it's not not anything to do with my life really it'll be i've had some work nightmares like where I can't count the chips that I need to be counting I can't get to the math or I can't. Count cards like I was supposed to count cards like it's kind of like with that or I can't find the cards and like where did they go. So it's. I don't know where they come from i'm just like what is this."
705.0,Provider,What were some of the nightmares coming up before he went return to work.
13657.0,Patient,"yeah yeah so and I used to have them what while I was working before too so and everybody has them yeah work, so there was always like you know joke around like do we just did a full shift when we were sleeping Do I really need to come back in."
705.0,Provider,It does seem like that's a pretty intense stressful position.
13657.0,Patient,yeah yeah so but I made it.
705.0,Provider,yeah and you can laugh at it today that. Is yeah what. you're saying about working the full shift before your shift.
13657.0,Patient,yeah yeah exactly i'm like okay well at least I can see the cards least like account still do math. Though yeah. And i've also changed kind of the way I supervise at work i'm not trying to be perfect anymore not trying to do at all anymore i'm not trying to make what the dealers that i'm watching perfect anymore not stressing over it. yeah so i'm going to definitely try to keep that mindset and make sure that I don't get to that perfectionist mindset again.
705.0,Provider,"yeah and if you catch yourself with it is just. Being able, especially should it should say when you should on yourself it's usually the indicator that you're going into the professional end zone."
13657.0,Patient,yeah yeah. yeah oh yeah.
705.0,Provider,So how are you then if you're managing a little bit different water what are some of the things you're doing that.
13657.0,Patient,"i'm i'm not you know watching dealers like right on top of their game. i'm not picking out them anymore. i'm not getting angry and irritable with them when they do make a mistake, you know we're all human. Of course we're going to make mistakes, I make mistakes, like so i'm not I don't get mad and add anymore I just kind of like hey it happens, you know it's fine. So. it's it's definitely definitely changing."
705.0,Provider,"Is cognitive behavior is what you're doing where you're changing things, because if you can change your expectations change what your perception is. that's going to then change your behavior change your."
13657.0,Patient,"mood yeah. yeah so definitely takes all the pressure off really so I haven't ran into an angry player yet so we'll see what happens when that happens, but. yeah it's yeah Hopefully the new mindset will help."
705.0,Provider,"Right right and it's Nice that with your those that you're supervising you probably have a different energy about you, too, and they're filling. out so."
13657.0,Patient,"they're they're definitely feeling it, you know I had multiple people come up to me and they're like wow you just you seem happy you're glowing you're you know. it's a whole different you like you're so much lighter and you're not stressed, you know don't have that wild look in my eyes and hear."
705.0,Provider,How you're like hey it's been a journey I didn't give up. I found my own way.
13657.0,Patient,yeah yeah. yeah so the work has been good.
705.0,Provider,"Well, if you have an unruly customer and especially in alcohol or maybe there's gonna be other substances involved."
13657.0,Patient,"yeah so. I don't think i'll deal with it as much as I did when I was on graveyards. Because you know there'll, be they had been drinking, like all day long by that point so right now, like working the shift and i'm working. I you know, the only start started drinking, so I don't think i'll run into too many, too many unruly players, but we do, since the pandemic started, you know, we had we shut down the casino for three months. At the beginning, and then, when we came back, we had all kinds of different regulations that we're doing for us for safety. And I find that player thurs and and people in general are just kind of rude now they don't know how to interact socially interact anymore, because they were you know locked. You know locked inside for so for a long period of time yeah it kind of feels and we're you know still wearing a mask. All day long. It kind of almost feels like. players or other people don't really look at you as a person anymore, they kind of just. There you they just see the mask and yeah so and i've heard a lot of people say that you know, both at work both you know just in their personal lives you're like yeah people are just you know how to interact socially anymore, they lost it it's. So that's definitely I mean it's gonna take everyone time to get used to the new normal so."
705.0,Provider,yeah that's really interesting that you're seeing that aspect of it.
13657.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Some of it, too, is, I know a lot of people have such the fear of the unknown and that's That is where it comes out as anger a lot to."
13657.0,Patient,"me yeah definitely so and I find that if you know something you know some like a player isn't like hearing me or someone isn't hearing me. i'll even i'll pull down my mask because i'm vaccinated i'm not i'm not worried I wasn't even ever worried about getting coated before the vaccines came out. You know, it was like if it's going to happen is going to happen and. It only thing I was worried about was spreading it to my parents, if I did get it, because they have underlying conditions and I don't so. um, so I think that was the only thing I worried about and they're fully vaccinated now with the booster and everything so they're definitely stress free and they always have been about it, like so."
705.0,Provider,Oh that's you know again another area to it's like the same thing with the cognitive behavior is. Working on where that's that's that person's projection of what's going.
13657.0,Patient,On yeah.
705.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
13657.0,Patient,"And I mean yeah when I do like pull down my mask to actually talk to them. it's like they come back into themselves where they're like Oh, this is a person i'm talking to you, and not just. A thing you know anymore like okay and they'll they'll kind of like take a step back and then they're like okay Thank you so much for listening to like my issues and sometimes that's All they need to kind of bend a little bit. yeah so, but you try to do that with a basketball and, for some reason they're just they just keep yelling. I know you're frustrated we're all frustrated with this yeah."
705.0,Provider,"eyes are good techniques, though, to bond with them and be like. Okay yeah."
13657.0,Patient,yeah yeah definitely so.
705.0,Provider,"Are you excited to. get back to work, this week and. start out."

Every like my supervisors are my managers are you know, trying to keep me in like easier sections that aren't. You know aren't really like challenging for the time being, there you know I think they're helping just ease me back into it, they don't want me to stress out too much so that's been really great."
705.0,Provider,"yeah event to that if there's a situation where you find where you know I worked with someone, the other day."
13657.0,Patient,That.
