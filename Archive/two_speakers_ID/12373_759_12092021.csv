For now. I. it's going to be extremely like almost a hard know for me. Just because. Recently there's been so many attacks on people and you know those follow home robberies and. um I I prefer right just for now. i'm not ready. To just work on myself.
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12373.0,Patient,yeah.

12373.0,Patient,"yeah yeah when he's there yeah it's no problem, like we we went and got our boosters. yeah and. I don't know if you got yours, but I feel like I got socked in my armpit. Really swollen and just. yeah it's not a."
759.0,Provider,pleasant feeling right.

759.0,Provider,it's yeah.
12373.0,Patient,Good for it yeah.
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12373.0,Patient,um. yeah. I don't think i'm ready to work on the agoraphobia thing just because i'm. feel like there's a lot of mental and personal issues that. I can work on with you first. Okay yeah.
759.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
12373.0,Patient,Okay um another Another thing I really wanted to talk to you about when i'm. So I went I went no contact with my family.
759.0,Provider,mm hmm. um so you the past abuse and yeah.
12373.0,Patient,"yeah and they my my mom I don't know why, but she blames me for her. Selling her house and moving to Pennsylvania from torrance."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12373.0,Patient,"But um my pets are playing that's that's been really nice um. She likes to get sympathy from like family members, she lies. about me a lot. My grandma kind of did that with my on like my when my grandma was living by herself and my aunt would go and like try to take care of her my grandma would complain to her other children like Oh, you know. Lisa doesn't come she doesn't see me that office you don't take care of me."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12373.0,Patient,"Which wasn't true, but I think she used it to gain sympathy, you know from her family members and that's kind of a pattern that I think my mom does she does it too much worse degree like. I. So a month ago, I had. A video of my dog she was. figuring out a little dog puzzle. He figured it out in under two minutes, and it was really proud of her for that. And my parents really love my dogs. And my dogs really love them, so I I sent it in a group chat I sent the video in a group pet to my my parents. my brother and his wife. And nobody responded, except for my brother's wife. And then I kind of had a breakdown that date. Like my husband and I fought. i'm pretty sure I took it out on him. And we're Okay, we move past it. And then on thanksgiving I spent thanksgiving greetings in the group chat okay again only my brother's wife responded."
759.0,Provider,No one else responded yeah.
12373.0,Patient,"um so I wanted to run this by you. yeah and see what you thought so. Christmas i'm i'm thinking of. Sending a text saying you know, this is my last. greeting for holidays or. special occasions. I wish you the best and. it's not out of malice but i'm protecting my peace."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12373.0,Patient,so happy. You know this is. And and and that's it. I haven't really planned out the wording of it but. i'm.
759.0,Provider,"So you want to send this tags, just as a farewell."
12373.0,Patient,"yeah as a way to say like this is like Merry Christmas Happy New Year. This is my last special occasion text to you guys. Because i'm going to protect my peace now. Where I don't know. The wording, but. yeah definitely. haven't thought it through, because I wanted to talk to you about it first."
759.0,Provider,Okay what's the reasoning behind it let's start there.
12373.0,Patient,I want to take my power back.
759.0,Provider,"Take your power back you want to you know. Say like I want to take my power back on want to be in control of the situation, I don't want to keep on sending text messages good messages out to my family and nobody finds. It for one person yeah. yeah."
12373.0,Patient,"And this is directed towards my parents, mostly because I have an okay relationship with my brother and his wife."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12373.0,Patient,"yeah we don't we don't fight or have conflict he's six years younger she's the same age as him and. You know they're both busy in their their daily lives and her family's out there, so she you know. Like i'm. I told them in October that i'm not i'm not doing Christmas gifts. That this year, I want to skip doing Christmas gifts and that was the one text that my mom did respond she just wrote okay. um but on the side my brother and I are just going to send each other, like gifts for each other's pets."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12373.0,Patient,And like little chocolate like i'm sending him some chocolate like it um. But yeah this is mostly from my parents.
759.0,Provider,"yeah so it's mostly for your parents well you know you can put in words that you know that can say, like, I wish you guys the best of holidays. You know, this is my last texts of 2021."
12373.0,Patient,And so you're like.
759.0,Provider,hey you.
12373.0,Patient,know this is my last text. i'm not sending texts in 2022.
759.0,Provider,"Oh, so you know. yeah i'm gonna send texts anymore."
12373.0,Patient,"No, I don't want to send like Happy Birthday or happy mother's day or anything like that I don't every time I send a text like that happy thanksgiving. And they don't respond. i'm. It hurts a lot. Because you know. I say Merry Christmas to like strangers like you know. grocery store, you know clerks. I it's not a thing for me. it's not it's just common courtesy to do wish someone a happy thanksgiving. yeah and. You know your family doesn't even respond happy thanksgiving to you too. yeah I just feel like it's So if I mean. yeah too yeah."
759.0,Provider,"yeah. Why don't you guys respond to to me my text messages and i'm trying to wish you good fortune and you guys just don't respond. Well, you know, like I I can't tell you what to do on you, is help you make the best decision for yourself in terms of you know what you want to do you know. yeah yeah it's still like if you feel. it's appropriate you know if this would get give you back your power. To go ahead and just say you know, like i'm no longer you know, this is my boss texts. me, and I wish you guys nothing about the bads happy holidays or whatever you want to say, but this is my last text, and you can just leave it like that."
12373.0,Patient,yeah I think I think i'm gonna do that. If you don't see any like negative.
759.0,Provider,"uh huh knowing negative I see is just not being able to tell them in person, how you're feeling, you know. But no, you do so much over attacks, you know, like I don't know if they're going to get the it the severity of that of like you're cutting them off it's essentially you're cutting them off, you know of communication. And you know so. yeah, how do you feel about just cutting them off in. terms of. Something I do want to do right now."
12373.0,Patient,"i'm. i'm sorry we're. Stop um. How do I feel in terms of cutting them off. i'm Okay, with it, I. i'm Okay, with it, I need to work on on myself, I need to become. Whole I need to become a person my own person and. and I haven't gotten. any type of closure or um. You know, when people will apologize, and you know they they say it, but they don't act it. Like my parents, they don't act it like. i've heard her say I heard her say like you know. Oh i'm sorry. I treated you like that, but then she keeps acting like this, you know so it's just words it's not real. it's just saying stuff to make herself feel better that Oh, you know, whatever I did wrong i'm sorry there I said it, you know if you don't live it it's not real. Well, to me, at least. i'm. So i'm okay with it i'm okay with yeah cutting them off and just for next year, I mean well, we can reevaluate i'm not saying this is permanent. yeah because nothing's permanent but for now like, I feel like. You need to keep awake."
759.0,Provider,yeah okay. Okay.
12373.0,Patient,and basically playing my path.
759.0,Provider,reclaim your power doesn't have to be in danger drastic you know.
12373.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,"You know, this is my final text for right now."
12373.0,Patient,You know yeah yeah.
759.0,Provider,"But then those types of words and just you know, like you can put just working i'll know how Pacific you want to get or you just want to be vague like this is my last tags for right now type of a no. yeah let's go over the wording, what would you like to say."
12373.0,Patient,"um, how can I work on it, and then in the in our next session i'll. Yes, I think our next session is before Christmas. yeah so. Christmas i'll read it to you. Okay, that session."
759.0,Provider,"Okay. So yeah okay. Okay sounds good yeah did you cut your hair by by any chance. No, no, have it look shorter. Good."
12373.0,Patient,Thank you um I started zoloft I made an appointment with shontelle and on your recommendation and she started me on zoloft.

759.0,Provider,"yeah being the version help you, with your anxiety so off, of course, are traveling with your depression, so I think that's really good yeah yeah you seem I can notice the difference, a little bit in terms of you talking, today, you seem more you know talkative today."
12373.0,Patient,My husband has shown. To he said that even though it's been a week only because they but they said that it takes two weeks start.
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12373.0,Patient,But um it's only been a week since i've been taking it in. But he says he feels different it feels different. mm hmm like yeah the vibe he's getting for me so. yeah yeah I feel less anxious to.
759.0,Provider,You feel less anxious to good. yeah good.
12373.0,Patient,What do you have any opinion on um I don't know if i'm saying his name right in a cart poli a carton.
759.0,Provider,me totally I don't know if I know that person is he.
12373.0,Patient,"So in our last session, you told me to look up. My yeah on YouTube so I did, and then you know you go down that hole. And just YouTube just takes you places yeah ECHO totally was one of the teachers or. When spirituals like college teachers I don't know. um so I watched one of his videos."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12373.0,Patient,Like a few times.
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12373.0,Patient,The one where there's one where he says that people can get addicted to negative thinking. and
759.0,Provider,"I think, so too. You do yeah. yeah I think it's all in your mindset, sometimes in terms of what you're thinking about what you're thinking patterns are and sometimes people yeah I can see how people, some people might get addicted to that negative mind frame and they get to the door, so they might have. yeah."
12373.0,Patient,"So, every time. Since I saw that video that I start thinking negatively. mm hmm i've been. Trying to you know, like we should be mindful. But also thinking like look, this is, this is an addiction have like you're going back for your fix. You think so I get."
759.0,Provider,It it kind of feels that way.
12373.0,Patient,"yeah it's helped me. Think of it in a different way, the. My mindset that. That i've been thinking this way for so long that i've been addicted to it mmm. That makes sense to me. Like it may not be applicable for everybody, but."
759.0,Provider,It makes sense to you.
12373.0,Patient,"yeah it makes sense for me that. Maybe maybe it's, not that I I like negative thinking, but you just get so used to it and. It becomes a habit. An addiction that like this is this is how I feel normal because i've been feeling like this for so long."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12373.0,Patient,So that that's one of the things in the past few weeks that i've been showing on.
759.0,Provider,"And yeah kind of like you're thinking congregants yeah. yeah shifting your perspective, a little bit instead of you know, this is always how's it going to be, you know I can learn new things I can grow I can know work on myself, you know just shifting your perspective yeah."
12373.0,Patient,Do you think it's. Like you just decide. i'm not going to. i'm not going to. Be traumatized by this anymore.
759.0,Provider,"I think your thoughts are powerful and some people can say that to themselves, you know, like if they don't want to, but we all know, trauma lives in the body and as far. You know, to kind of like get away from RSA like i'm going to be cured from my traumatic experience I think he can process do regular ways to cope with trauma and learn ways so talking about the discussing and doing talk therapy doing other types of therapy to seek safety within yourself. You know I think yeah saying that to yourself, could help but i'm not too sure if it's all it's going to take away all of the pain from. yeah."
12373.0,Patient,I wish it was as easy as that.
759.0,Provider,"As that yeah I would say, you know i'll be our job is it was."
12373.0,Patient,"No there's no much. You know, we need. I need you, we need you know so much. yeah um. So um. um. i'd like to talk about my. My anxiety for medication."
759.0,Provider,and anxiety about taking medication.
12373.0,Patient,i'm like. When I asked for refills when I need refills. I feel like a drug seeker. hmm but then I don't feel like that about weed I don't feel like that about cannabis.
759.0,Provider,"canvas um let's shift your perspective about medication. Okay medication is added tool, you know, think of it as an added tool to help you feel better. So that you have to be on medication for forever. You know, is it's an added tool to help me get through my days you know for me to work on, you know it's helping me with my anxiety and depression. So look at it as a tool that that your drug seeking. yeah something that helps you, you know just like taking a walk might help you are doing some yoga might help you, you know medication and sad tool."
12373.0,Patient,Like the adderall really help. I do. feel like I struggle so much with executive dysfunction. and emotional dysregulation.
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12373.0,Patient,and adderall just makes it simple for me.
759.0,Provider,For you yeah.
12373.0,Patient,"um. But then there's that you know, like you know those 1950s. So the wives that take. feed, and then they go vacuum. You know the whole House. That like trope I don't get it. I feel that that shame, I guess, when I talked to even you about taking adderall like I feel like. I have ADHD imposter. syndrome yeah."
759.0,Provider,yeah it's like your imposter yeah.
12373.0,Patient,"But like I you know I watch videos with people who have ADHD themselves, and I do a lot of you know. Indigenous independent work on it, you know the workbook i'm still working through it, the ADHD for adults by Dr barkley. Like the stuff in the workbook it all hits you know. But then you hear about. Like Oh, you know people have ADHD. Like traits. Like everybody struggles with. A little bit of executive dysfunction a little bit of. This emotional dysregulation but. I don't. I don't know I don't know how to get over my. imposter syndrome about it."
759.0,Provider,"Do you feel like okay well if imposter syndrome, you know you kind of feel like you're a fraud, a little bit. yeah you're you know, but what about having ADHD feel like you're and you know, a fraud wow."
12373.0,Patient,um So when I went to see my. My GP um. He I told him that I I stopped taking cymbalta and. That chantelle had prescribed. at all for me and then he just gave me this whole speech about how um you know students come in wanting to patch patch. and perform better and. Adult. hmm.
759.0,Provider,"So, but that's not you sorry to cut you off."
12373.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. yeah i'm not a student and. I don't know um. I wasn't asking him. You know, for an ad. For adderall prescription, I was just letting him know so that he could put it in my records that. i'm not taking cymbalta anymore and i'm on this medication."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12373.0,Patient,I should change GPS. I have.
759.0,Provider,yeah like good and that goes back to you sound like a little bit like an Audi great like you're.
12373.0,Patient,Here I.
759.0,Provider,"Think is is that you're not an addict you know people have addictions is is more about I can say that maybe your clinic chemically dependent on you know out the wrong, but you know, like. We all, when we take medications become dependent on that. You know chemically you know, an addict behavior a drug seeking that's something totally different so kind of like. and want you to shift your focus to kind of like this is medication to help me, you know I might be dependent, you know physically dependent on this, but doesn't mean that I have to take this for forever, I have a medical condition. Tell yourself because ADHD depression, anxiety you're all medical conditions. yeah I have to take medication for. Just like a diabetic was needed insulin every single day. I here, each and every single day to function."
12373.0,Patient,I don't take it on the weekend.
759.0,Provider,"Oh, why not."
12373.0,Patient,"um. Because of that stigma. Because I feel like if if if i'm able to not take it on the weekends, then i'm not really addicted and i'm not addicted to it, though that's the thing."
759.0,Provider,"yeah you did yeah, which is something totally different than. yeah see I want you to look up diction versus dependency. And you get to understand on. You know that you're not addicted you know diction Francis dependency."
12373.0,Patient,Okay. i'm. Okay.
759.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah. Because. You know and Alec is mostly his behavior plus a dependency you don't have to behave or geek as an addict you know you're not out there, trying to get drugs off the street or anything like that. Though yeah get on drug seeking you know."
12373.0,Patient,I don't feel this way about the Zola. More than you are just.
759.0,Provider,Because it's stigma behind it.
12373.0,Patient,You know people can't get.
759.0,Provider,"For performance and people take good because of it makes them feel good or whether for you might happen hot have it, or they know like uppers so they take get you know but that's not the case you take it, because you have a medical condition, you know."
12373.0,Patient,Okay.
759.0,Provider,"I hope that helps I know there's a lot of stigma behind, as are all you know, like and night, and I feel for you in terms of you know. Having the take it and feeling a certain type of way about it."
12373.0,Patient,In our first few sessions you're very still.
759.0,Provider,I was very still oh. yeah around yeah you do that sometimes.
12373.0,Patient,I mean like.

759.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
12373.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
759.0,Provider,So I was very still in the first session probably.
12373.0,Patient,The first. Few sessions yeah.
759.0,Provider,The sessions yeah.
12373.0,Patient,"And I did think about it, like over the weeks, I was like this that is that how she's gonna be or is that, like her superpower to like let me get it all out so that."
759.0,Provider,"I wanted to let you get out and talk, you know. You just need to sometimes people just need to talk it out, you know. And yeah to you know voice what's going on and what's happening, but um yeah. yeah. And you can always tell me like Nada I had enough."
12373.0,Patient,"No, no. I know I trust I trust your brain. and your training that I know you've got this you know that's why. that's why you're here yeah. yeah so yeah. But um. yeah I was. I was really. In a lot of pain before. mm hmm but i'm ready to. go in a much more. Progressive direction. Okay yeah with your guidance."
759.0,Provider,Please.
12373.0,Patient,Please help me.
759.0,Provider,"yeah, of course, of course, let's talk about today, I think we talked about it, and maybe the first couple sex sessions, but let's really work on a treatment plan for you. want to go. By what is one thing that area of concern that you want to work on. Or is it just mental health in general I want better mental health for myself."
12373.0,Patient,"I do want better mental health, yes. I want to. I want to be more authentic. I want to be able to be authentic with. Myself and and the people in my life. Instead of scared and. I feel like i'm a crumpled piece of paper and I just need. to smooth it all out, you know. i'd like to be a productive member of society."
759.0,Provider,"Okay productive member of society okay. what's some steps you want to take. Like what would be a goal for you, or what is your ultimate goal for mental health recovery."
12373.0,Patient,"A goal, I guess, would be to be. To to own my own. place in this world, I don't know if that makes sense. But I i'd like to walk around not being. In pain are so fearful."
759.0,Provider,Not being pain. And so fearful okay.
12373.0,Patient,"Sometimes I feel like. Maybe it's the way I love or. i'm how I hold myself, but I feel like people. Can just. Tell that i'm not confident and. i'm. yeah."
759.0,Provider,"So you think sometimes people can doubt they look at a certain type of way that they can see that. You know, sometimes people who have been abused, you know, especially abusers are looking for people who are the most vulnerable and maybe you weren't given build key on your sleeve and people might be able to know the Stat."
12373.0,Patient,yeah yeah yeah. Yes. that's.
759.0,Provider,yeah.
12373.0,Patient,"Okay i've always been very sensitive and. i'm like I cry the drop of a hat. mm hmm ever since I was little then like I remember asking my friend in middle school like how come, you will cry anymore like she was my best friend, since you know kindergarten and then a middle school something changed and then she she just didn't cry anymore and. I asked her and she's like oh yeah you know, so my boyfriend just told me like don't cry. And I didn't. I don't I didn't get it, and I still don't try to you know cuz. When I feel the urge to cry just Kurdish."
759.0,Provider,"mm hmm. It just comes yeah. I think it's okay to be sensitive and to know that about yourself, you know that you're sensitive person I think that's okay. So, again back to the treatment plan i'm going to try to create one that makes sense to you and I want you to know what your treatment plan that's. So your goal is to have better mental health. better manage. My mental health tells us own. better manage my mental health. and objective step can be learn. To dream cope with coping skills. That help you. That help you with symptom management. And symptom management of both like depression. and anxiety. An ADHD. yeah. And I can put three coping skills, you know. Coping skills could be. mindfulness. and emotional regulation. that's that sounds good, I want you to be the captain of the. You tell me emotional regulation or what some other skill that you like to learn and in case you know when we're talking about kind of like symptom management."
12373.0,Patient,i'd like i'd like to not i'm. not let my family get to me so much I don't I don't really have any conflicts with my friends. mm hmm um.
759.0,Provider,"Learn healthy boundaries how's that. Yes, learn."
12373.0,Patient,Yes.

759.0,Provider,away about yourself yeah.
12373.0,Patient,"yeah. um I almost feel like pray. to her. I don't understand why i'm her. it's not even adversary, I guess pray is a good word but um but I don't I don't know if there's even a good answer because maybe that's just how she is you know and. My dad he he loves her so much and he. he's fallen into that that narcissistic trap that you know when you get in a relationship with a narcissistic person like if you don't get out of it, you just completely fall. fall into it and become. One of their flying monkeys you know. yeah and. he's he's stressed her main monkey."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12373.0,Patient,"And I think. I have to grieve that I have to grieve this relationship, yes that's something I would like to work on is i'd like to grieve my relationship with my parents. This is a good question. I didn't even think about that."
759.0,Provider,"Okay, good my relationship with my parents okay."
12373.0,Patient,"So i'd like your guidance on how to properly and health in a healthy way. read it, so that I can move past it so that they can no longer. hurt me."

12373.0,Patient,yeah I just I just need I don't know what I need to I need something to.
759.0,Provider,"A strategy, maybe. Maybe like how how long how much time do you want to spend per day, looking at places to move to maybe give yourself a set time. With I hope. You know, like i'm gonna give myself like an hour in the morning to the good places call places made me make a two to three appointments to go see places per week are pair maybe. every couple weeks see new place and see if it works, you know check out the neighborhood maybe give yourself a little bit of on. Like some structure to you know searching for a place that might help does that sound reasonable."
12373.0,Patient,"Well i'm writing this down. Okay, I read, I was listening to a podcast and he had to write write in your journal with when you're with your therapist so that you can. Remember, everything that they say. i'm sure. or looking at housing."

12373.0,Patient,"Like okay like don't only do it for like a certain amount of time sure like Okay, I only have to do this for an hour."
759.0,Provider,"And then, after that I don't have to do anymore."
12373.0,Patient,Okay okay yeah I think I could do that yeah reasonable yeah.
759.0,Provider,"yeah you've been reasonable for yourself, so you don't have to let it overwhelm you."
12373.0,Patient,Okay.
759.0,Provider,"Even it doesn't even have to be an hour, he can be 30 minutes you know just so. yeah much time as you want to give to it in the morning yeah. yeah only saying now we're, just in case you want to make some appointments, so you want to research that can mean T that their apartment design and."
12373.0,Patient,Look yeah.
759.0,Provider,"see if it has like a walkable score. In terms of you walking your dog look up schools, I don't know whatever you want to look up."
12373.0,Patient,yeah yeah. Okay. um.
759.0,Provider,"And maybe give yourself a little bit of a goal, like, I want to look at the place. To places within the next three weeks I don't know like short term goal, you know yeah."
12373.0,Patient,"Okay, I can do that. it'll probably be good for Kevin. You can take my meetings."
759.0,Provider,"yeah I know moving moving is stressful. yeah by that's a nother life event that people don't realize that it's actually pretty stressful you know I don't want to make you feel more for a while, but just give yourself some. compassion when it comes to you know, like filling the stress of moving, that is a stress fall invent."
12373.0,Patient,"yeah. Do you think whenever I feel chantel I want to tell her like how thankful, I am. For her. because she ever since I started therapy and I think may she she was my kind of trust."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12373.0,Patient,"And, and it hasn't changed like she hasn't left the company or anything and she's been very. Like. Just she does her job really well. And every time I have appointments with her, I always want to tell her like you. know I really appreciate you just for showing up and. Thank you for like all your work and stuff but i'm i'm starting to wonder is it is it a trauma response, like a fun trauma response."
759.0,Provider,"I think, to be appreciative so someone you know someone that is actually helping you out I think that's okay I don't think that you have to you know it'd be one thing if you didn't like the person, then you want to be light, are you wanting to put on this facade about the. Personal thing you Jane you do leave like. You know you're genuine about that that you actually like person precedence actually helping you out so. I think just being able to say dad that's okay."
12373.0,Patient,We think it makes other person uncomfortable.
759.0,Provider,"No just say, like, I appreciate you, you know I appreciate you helping me it doesn't have to be elaborate you know and just show your appreciation and that way."
12373.0,Patient,"Okay. Okay i've been feeling kind of guilty about it, or just maybe wondering if it's a fun fun trauma response, because I do tell people like I watched head last oh. I like that show a lot. and You know I I thought it's so nice to practice appreciation so i've been trying to do that more, but then I get in my head so often like Oh, is this a trauma response. For are you practicing appreciation. i'm not."
759.0,Provider,"mo. I think it's appreciation. yeah you know, like you're just you know, trying to fake it or."
12373.0,Patient,"You know, know."
759.0,Provider,"You know, like you feel like he have a need to do it, you know, but it seems like it's coming from a good part, then you know from you, you know. yeah like your heart, you know just showing appreciation."
12373.0,Patient,"I it's I can't I can't it's hard for me to be fake because. there's so much in my head that I can't juggle all of this. All of the everything in my head. You know, on top of that managing being being fake and like oh so I usually just end up not having a response, like to people. And I think that might come off wrong, maybe or not well received, I don't know, but I just usually. don't respond. I don't know."
759.0,Provider,"I get what you're trying to say like you're not a big person, and if it comes to that you just not gonna respond yeah."
12373.0,Patient,"yeah I just sort of freeze and I don't know. What what the appropriate thing to do is, but I just I just don't do anything."
759.0,Provider,yeah.
12373.0,Patient,I feel like yeah.
