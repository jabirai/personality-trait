9340.0,Patient,yeah sorry.
386.0,Provider,"Too out of the 20 last prescribed. And it me i've walgreens drug store for ya at 41400 a block how road and fremont. Are you and your okay on the sertraline then. Just the adderall that we're getting pretty low on okay. So what i'm looking over here is what your chart is coming back is that you're currently enrolled in the program for mental health. and your current group frequency is scheduled to be bi monthly with individual therapy, as well as bi monthly and so. What it's suggesting right now is that the care intensity raising is that there's excessive no shows, and that you must be three be seen three times a week or recommended higher level of care discharge will occur. So right now they're suggesting that your group be changed to three times a week and then your suggested individual therapy scheduled to twice a month. i'm going to kind of just leave it like that, and let you know just be aware that you should probably talk to shinto at your next meeting okay. i'm not going to make you go to more group appointments at this moment, because the prescription that you are requesting is for a see to medication, which is adderall. And so the request has to go fish and TAO one way or another, and it does look like here you completed out your Bam seven the compliance video questionnaire the pH to nine and the uds which is your urine drug testing. So that's all been completed in here the prescription recommendation. If I were to send the medication, in which I can't do anyways because it's a see to, but if I were to send it in I would only be able to send in the medication for a two day supply. And that's with no refills and that's hoping that you would get to intercession tell sooner rather than later, and then you would have to call us back in two days, and then it just it'd be messy so. What I am recommending I will send a message over to shontelle right now, but within that message I am just going to let you know that you definitely need to discuss like your appointment scheduling with her. In regards of your I know that you're doing individual MED follow ups, one on one which is fantastic, but your last group or individual meeting with shinto was back on. nine seven so we haven't seen you in white sometime, and so we just want to, I just want to make sure that you follow up with Intel okay. All right, let me get a message over. She tells pretty quick to respond so just give me a few short moments here. Your allergies, no, no drug allergies currently. yeah perfect. And are you still located at 129 Fisk terrorists in fremont. yeah perfect phone number is at 5104 or 588489."
9340.0,Patient,yeah.
386.0,Provider,"And I have email TAO no 1024 at gmail COM. yeah perfect. Based off of the last damn seven that you completed today, it looks as if. Your. result came back with some type of concern for your physical health, you are, you have you been sick."
9340.0,Patient,And no.
386.0,Provider,Any changes within your physical House have you been seen by your normal PCP.
9340.0,Patient,And no I don't see them often.
386.0,Provider,"Okay, it looks like here, there was some concerns on the you haven't just been getting quite a bit of sleep here. What I would recommend for sleep on any type of therapy would be yoga knee drop, it is a it's a yoga but it's not like a stretching yoga it's more so of meditation I currently utilize yoga me drop by katie Fabian. You I just I what I do is I get get on YouTube and I look it up. Really yoga nita and there's lots of opportunities for you, but it's more like a meditation state that way you're able to get some type of rem sleep okay. alrighty so I did go ahead and send in the request for that prescription, to be able to be sent in for you, I will give you a phone call back once your prescription has been. sent in successfully, it will be most likely either be a 30 day supply as well or not 30 day supply she's been sending it in and. 14 day increments so it'll most likely either stay as that 14 day increments or there's that possibility that it may just be a bridge to get you over to your next appointment. And that is up to should tell Okay, but when I call you back, I will let you know what has been sent in and so you'll have you know the the way workaround for that, and then we should be good to go. Okay okay you're absolutely welcome is there anything else that i'm able to assist with today. Perfect if you have any additional questions or concerns we're here until 4pm Pacific standard time, so if there's anything else that you need just don't hesitate to reach back out to us okay."
