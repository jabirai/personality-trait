148.0,Provider,I am Ashley yes it's nice to meet you how are you doing. I saw that uncertainty in your face after you said that. You doing okay today.
14930.0,Patient,Oh alright.
148.0,Provider,"Alright, so um. let's see here, so you met with tanya correct your. Perfect all right let's get started, we have about 30 minutes i'm going to be asking you just some questions to get to know you a little bit better today run your history and background, do you have any questions before we get started."
14930.0,Patient,Know right i'm probably have someone reserved to close my door.
148.0,Provider,"Okay, no problem. So let's start with what brings you to treatment and why now."
14930.0,Patient,"i'm getting triggered. by a number of things, but. The ultimate trigger is me being forced to leave my home and i've already spread that I don't leave my home alone, much less hardly ever leave my all. and i've had. A number of disputes. With neighbors I have a dropping sister, who has been to prison twice, so I have to step lightly with her Whenever she does drop in. That because again horrendous which sort of. triggers the neighbors to act out some more. i've been raped rob shot is stopped by the police repeatedly for no reason, no taking no nothing literally cut out to tears i've. been just a lot of stuff drag the almost dragged through a car window, because my band broke down on the one can and and the guy they're stopped was like here use my cell phone I reaching the gift of self all and he tries to literally pulled me through the window. So. These by put on my regalia then somebody wants to attack me and tell me what i'm not ethnically year what I am absolutely is just a lot of things and i'm. i'm i've had it with people, and this is the first time I actually went through a three year. hiatus of not going out or anything of that nature, so this is the first time by any means and i'm still functional when i'm a shot is because i'm also an artist. But nonetheless. My addiction would most likely be my desire to show my heart to be heard and things like that and that actually brings about a lot of my troubles, with people, because the music industry bikes like Hill and there's a bunch of very. unsavory type characters and not to mention that i've already had, I lost my child to well I got impregnated by a frickin grammy award winning winning junkie you know, and my child died so and I literally am in the company of. Professional touring working musician so this can be anything from me playing a coffee house in front of a few people to me literally standing in front of thousands of people, you know and. My bladder I get I have to go to the bathroom a lot when i'm. waiting on things and and all of that others there's just a lot to me I don't really want to deal with people i've I don't I don't have any I just don't I can't."
148.0,Provider,where's the pressure to leave your House coming from. You said I.
14930.0,Patient,"had to let me is triggering me is literally from the Los Angeles judicial system, because they don't know me. And they're all like paying, you have to come down here, I said hey i've been raped rob shot it and I, you know stopped by the police repeatedly don't want to do it. Oh hey well you know so then they're like well give us a letter of whatever so that's how I came in contact with you all, or does it affect it, I was really actually already considering having a therapist because. My ear died of colon my best friend died of colon so I don't have the only other person that I interact with on such levels is my husband, who has really, really, really been there and, quite frankly, he does not need. All of this. knows, but he just he doesn't need golf shirts and literally when I go out he is the person That takes me to where I have to go, I was actually doing a monthly show. In the town that I live in bringing in artists musicians painters comedians blah blah blah. Every month, I was literally getting cussed out by some strange person, you know, for whatever reasons pain that's my fault and I literally would also cater. So it wasn't just that I was getting cussed out, it was that people were coming and taking from me and not helping me or anything so my husband is literally, the only person. That helps me so he literally helped a load up my band or his van not my band because he's also a surfer, so this is really important. So he take all of your stuff out of his vehicle load up my stuff in his vehicle take me to the club unloaded my stuff from his vehicle helped me set up and then he would go to sleep in his vehicle until like. 2am 3am, which is when the club and everything is over wake up help me zone all of my feedback after his vehicle get me home help me unload all my crap out of his vehicle put him back in his vehicle and then go surfing at 4am in the morning. only person who has ever ever ever been there, even for this, but also he has to be there to hear whether somebody is getting ready to jump me or cut me out or whatever else, because who knows where the security is going to have my back The other thing is that. Men are literally like i'm going to annihilate you i'm gonna kill you carry yourself if people. It used to be, that I was actually someone the freak of nature, like, I would have these encounters these strange encounters with. You know, someone just ran up and put their face in my pubic area crying and talking about take me on what so I actually even though i'm an artist I don't like to fan stuff i'm having I have a problem with that I don't like to be approached. By strangers, so I get like you know, but the other thing is that. Now people have gotten so much more aggressive like just the everyday person is become just like out ladders be aggressive and. That makes me nervous, it makes it, it makes me super super uncomfortable It makes me uncomfortable that. Not only that, but the thing that triggers me is that again a judicial system that wants me to go and make a decision about someone else's life. has failed me repeatedly like repeatedly like I run into police station, because I was show. And shot it and shit like that, and some frickin COP just laughed and sent me on my bed my way you know sort of thing, so I have the road. The road patient zero interest zero I don't have it me I literally do not have it me so that triggers me, but before that against my sister was over here cussing me out a carrying on because. I closed the door too loud in her opinion the neighbors so she's out there, talking about no one in my family loves me because I will come outside well. They shoot people and shit like that, so why should I want to interact with them they're constantly fighting and beating on each other if I keep talking about my mother. My mother used to put my food on the table for breakfast for lunch and for dinner. put my food on the table and then say penguin penguin meant go for your panties down and lay across the bed and get my butt beat. then go eat my food coming and going before I left the House to go to school, go have fun go whatever I got my butt beat when I came home I got my buddy I don't I don't want to do this so Kobe. made me interact, because I, my husband and I we made like two to 300 maths and we donated to them to harbor hospital and San Pedro post office. Well, the very first person that actually got in contact me with me was a wife of a musician but she's also a doctor and she got in contact with me. Through Facebook via whatever she asked for map and I said I had already donated them, you know tonight, she said enough fair but then like two weeks later her husband was in the hospital with Kobe two weeks after that he was there, I felt that. Not that me giving her mass we're going to save her husband or anything of that nature, but I felt, you know the last band my working day. The reason why I left was because i'm being threatened by people you know getting drunk phone calls in the morning, you know telling me that they have guns and things like that, because I stood in the Center of the stage when that's where the lead vocalist can. You know sort of thing but there's sometimes up to 30 people on that stage at any given time because they're coming from across the ocean and and off tour with you know whomever Prince. William don't princess kid but some of his band members time James brown so i'm literally around working musicians, who are all just piling up on stage, nobody even before covidien nobody was. doing any sort of protecting each other from anything there's still in my microphones I can smell, you know, whatever that's coming off of the end they're not stealing my microphone. In private you're stealing my microphone on stage in front of hundreds of people, you know sort of thing. And then literally talking about do you want to fight, you know, are you going to fight about it hi it's mine, you know, so I have different voices I can't get into little tiny voice hey. that's my microphone you know pitches not your microphone tonight, now I gotta kick gave another voice in my pocket microphone every night I paid for it, you know sort of thing, so you know these my interactions that's my job. And that's how i'm being treated all my job, you know, and then the drug person will call the next morning cut about. You know what I gotta go I gotta go the other boo boo boo boo boo or if the other person that threaten to shoot me because I sat on the tour bus. in the wrong place, you know sort of thing and and so now, I have to ride for another two hours or six hours in the same vehicle with someone they're just threatened to shoot me because I sat in there, see you know sort of thing. And even then. No one is protecting me no one says stop no one says you're wrong, no one, no one is just like every everything is a damn job. Or you know you just supposed to fight it out i'm in my 60s. i'm not supposed to fight it out with anyone and it's not as though I don't fight or I haven't fought because i've had to fight. Quite frankly, i'm tired of fighting so that's been yet even this whole trigger shame I don't even get to go and protect myself. Because again I don't leave my house without some little ring or something i'm sorry that is going to make me feel a little bit safer so. I have these strangers that give this much of a about my life and then it's as simple as oh go get a doctor's excuse. Okay damn so now, I have to find a doctor, and you know I need a doctor yeah or a therapist I need to talk to someone you know for the things. But do I need to be down this rabbit hole because the other thing is, quite frankly, these very things that i'm saying you i'm really supposed to be writing in my high graphical documentaries and i'm procrastinating because I don't really want to keep. reliving this crap you know, every day, or whatever and plus I see most of the people that really i'd be actually writing about. They still exist they're still working you know so and, quite frankly, a lot of them already know this this book is in process, so they have friends that are not happy as well it's just like this, this people feel like. Not only do they get to treat me a certain way, but they also get to be fine how i've been treated rewrite it spin it off into whatever the atmosphere, you know I mean so. coven has brought. The dead baby Daddy to the service is brush my mother to the surface, which literally. cannot tell me that she loves me she cannot tell me that she likes me she cannot even tell me that we are friends or with why know we not, but nonetheless. You know. And then of course there's family who were just like well gosh special mother, but their mothers never wished them there repeatedly. So if I don't I said enough if you have any questions."
148.0,Provider,So you've mentioned your mom. Did you have any relationship with your father. We work.
14930.0,Patient,"Together i'm fine he is effectively kept my father's from me, I also recently got in contact with someone that I thought was my stepfather's but then found out. Recently, that they were never legally married, although he is the man that has followed her from Kansas city Missouri Las Vegas to California and he is the one that does actually. embracing So when I talked to him he's very, very excited to hear from me he still calls me the same name that he called me when I was a little kid The thing is, is that he does have a family, he has legitimate children and stuff and he's in his 80s now, and even that. I. I don't really want to impose you know I mean and and every time I talked to him. he's always going to ask about my mother, but he's always going to tell me that my mother never left me and she's always chosen. My brothers and sisters over me."
148.0,Provider,"sisters, do you have."
14930.0,Patient,"I have one sister, and I, who knows how many my mother is that woman who would have a baby bring it home and then maybe a month later that baby was gone and I was never supposed to speak about that in fact I got beat up a few times in my life. Simply mentioning so I actually have one which goes back to my family again who keeps getting into faith which ideas. To my mother and my husband's birthday are literally on the same day so it's no way that I could actually forget her existence, you know, by any means, but you know I, and it was just recently in fact September 29 so I celebrated my husband. To the best of my ability, without leaving the House, you know and. Then I get a call I mean a text from my eye and she also send a photo of my mother and my other. You know and she's talking about what a great time you know, look at what I gave them and. All those businesses same on every time I talked to her says that she is done with her sisters, because they never cared about her. So, but this time she decides that she wants to go pick up one, thank you, does the other one my mother of you know celebrate her birthday would cake and Nice wonderful sweet thing you know, and so I did my best. I didn't respond on the day of my birthday my husband's birthday I waited a day later, and I said that was very sweet, because I was still trying to find some nice shift to say, rather than to say leave me alone again. You know and, quite frankly, the time before that it was. my brother, in fact, one of the brothers that my mother gave away sure I still call him my brother, but I mean because yeah biologically he is but. This person is a little literally a stranger and absolutely wants to remain a stranger you know, has straight out say I do not want anything to do with any of you. I can relate, you know, and I have no intentions of impressing you know pressing upon him my space my energy anything, because he has made his decision my other brother my youngest youngest is my brother cousin. Because I convinced my aunt and uncle to adopt camp I just lost my uncle also. And so now my brother. we're not poor and we are American history, let me say that also because that's another part of I think why we're so deranged and out of control and just foul people. So, my name is on cities in this country, my last name ratings bill Oklahoma That was a reservation I am American Indians. Tulsa Oklahoma my family's name is on there as the pioneers of that we have cemeteries in my name there, and all of that, so I often wondered. Why we behave the way we behave you know sort of thing, why are we so spoil, why are we so because that's The other thing is my mother has moved 1000 times and she will leave every bit of furniture in the House and all of that, so that has a lot to do with why don't want to go anywhere. I found my house I bought my house my house is paid for I don't want to go anywhere, you know i'm not doing now have I you know gone out to other countries and stuff to to serve or to play music. Apps and freakin lulu but I get to come home to mind, while they are still doing whatever my sister is that same sort of nomadic person who will then back. You know, in a piece of property, but then you know she'll be out of there in a moment, my other brother, on the other hand, owns a whole side of the street. A whole block, you know now and then the youngest one that I initially started talking about is now sitting on 300 plus acres that are over 300 years old. So we are no joke. by any means, but at the same time we'd like the biggest frickin joke, the weird the most dysfunctional. Family i've ever got to know so i'm generally adopted into someone else's family but, quite frankly, even that comes with like this crazy and if if there's a. discrepancy or whatever with one person, then that ends up being the discrepancy with the whole family, you know if i'm having friends, then, quite frankly. And I don't have any because. If i'm trying to have a conversation i'm doing only on the phone with other people on speaker and. They got everybody else listening so i'm having i'm having no privacy, other than with again my husband and was with my friend who passed away what what so."
148.0,Provider,Was there any mental health or substance abuse issues in your family.
14930.0,Patient,"I just think it greatly my sister might be, but then quite frankly I don't actually know her i'm 18 years older than her we've just I don't know her so you know I really it would actually be speculation, I don't even know why she was in prison. twice."

We call it a contact hi i'm that person. Okay that's helpful. I wind up driving home so i'm drunk. If i'm in the presence of a lot of liquor if i'm in the presence of a lot of marijuana if i'm in the presence of in i've been in the presence of pain, because i'm a musician. go on."
148.0,Provider,"yeah yeah no I hear what you're saying um I just want to get through the these last few questions because we just have about seven minutes left, but the next time we meet it can be totally open I won't.
