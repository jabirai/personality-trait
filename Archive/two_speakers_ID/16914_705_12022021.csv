705.0,Provider,"yeah so have you ever had before we call it for short, a bps but a bio psych social where it's more information gathering."
16914.0,Patient,I don't know what it is.
705.0,Provider,"Okay it's different than a counseling session, like in a counseling session, you and I would talk about coping skills and things like that today is more of gathering some information some past some current and that way, we can see how to help you best. Okay, and then confidentiality and privacy is important and so during intake you probably remember seeing all the privacy, you know different forms that you were able to sign. Just to let you know Susan like if someone called outside of bright heart health and said hey you met with Susan yesterday you know what was the outcome, I wouldn't be able to confirm or deny until you sign a release of information form so just. Understand okay perfect exceptions to the rules and you might have already heard, this is. exceptions to the rules if it's an emergency, of course, we're going to get you help if you're homicidal or suicidal, then we would help you know manage those situations outside of that is where mandated APS are in CPS reporters and other than that. what's you know what's shared here is."
16914.0,Patient,confidential.
705.0,Provider,"You have any questions about that. No okay great, and thank you to Susan I have your history in front of me that you filled out prior to us meeting, which is very helpful too, so thank you for that. Before we get going, is there any anything that you need you know, to ask or anything like that."
16914.0,Patient,"No, not right now. I guess last later on."
705.0,Provider,Absolutely i'm part of what I like to always hear Susan is what are your reasons for joining bright heart health.
16914.0,Patient,"Well, I have been experiencing a lot of frustration anxiety seen on things and i'm based. On myself and a lot of my family's in different states like sister lives in Arizona, who I don't really get along with very much at all, and my family is my family was out in New York and I don't really get to see them that all. Those other things off. And it's not it's not just that I guess the whole bunch of other stuff mean like you know when you're trying to get yourself fully set up when you're on disability and everything it's a lot of takes a lot of time, you know people. I think a lot of people don't really quite understand, especially when you're trying to explain other people who, who are not. Within the same proximity, you know, like like I said they're there they're living i'm not all here all my own there Derek they don't I don't see them as much as I can, or want to or the certain people who I tried to talk with they don't quite get me as much as they did in the past and. I tried to get along with them, but they want to, or I feel they don't want to, so I just. And what i've tried to talk with my son my family tried to confront them about it just gets worse, and so I just or maybe I feel that, so I just want to I guess it's why i'm here, and maybe. Maybe maybe see if I can not only that I used to have she a therapist in high school, you know, but I didn't see that anymore, and I was. ADHD medication. And i'm not anymore either. I could, I asked my um they're all just it's all it be okay, and she said he couldn't refuse because she said, it might be over medication."
705.0,Provider,"Well i'm glad that you're here and i'm glad that you're you know ready to explore some of those things that you were talking about and that's definitely you know, one of the reasons people come into bright heart health it's also nice to. Not only do we do the individual sessions, but then also the group sessions which is nice you'll get to meet other people I, you mentioned that sometimes it seems like. Some may not get you or they don't they don't know where you're coming from where it's Nice."
16914.0,Patient,"To like when I. mean they give me the person money like with personal issues or situation down, and it can quite because you know i'm. Because the distance or or like maybe they don't want to. don't want to accept all how difficult or how. You know I mean the situation of it. yeah."
705.0,Provider,"Oh yeah and so in in Group then you'll meet others that maybe you relate to, and maybe you know, then it's Nice that you don't feel alone and you're able to just you know walk away sometimes."
16914.0,Patient,"When I when I saw therapist when I was in high school and it was. It was great and. It was awesome I resolve issues just I feel like. I want, I want a group there, it sounds great too, but I just want to hear more people out and not be so i'm. by myself, you know. yeah yeah."

In the paper and i'll call i'll i'll read, most of it and i'll come back to it later I guess.

Furthermore, before I start with my friend and Sam Cisco ahead and I used to have with other roommate but um he's not a really he's friend my sister quran. and I just didn't like him to begin with, I feel like they're always like i'm I feel like i'm. With the word. I feel like he doesn't deserve much of my sisters help us as much as he deserves that I feel like he's um. Well, I just don't think he's I just don't think um. Well, I don't know I think I think it's been a bunch of a joke, but jokes or was it a nice a sense of the word in the nicest sense of the word.

I, so I got ios worker, I am in a bitch about a year later, I got my disability, social security, save my room I started staying with a friend. And you know what i've been very happy since and. I think it's been mentioned, and I think I, and I am homeless by choice i've always been homeless by choice because i've had a P O box. and yeah and I feel like every time that I want to. talk with her or anything I feel like for some reason that she shares all my from my conversation heard it back to him and that's not even you know.

16914.0,Patient,got any release information for her did I.
705.0,Provider,"um I don't see anything on on your record here of where you would sign it your sister, you know you would you."
16914.0,Patient,"All right, good I probably wouldn't have you know she helped them get benefits. And you know I don't think she and I don't think he deserved it."

705.0,Provider,No.
16914.0,Patient,"I mean, like, I mean I don't really think he does, I don't I really never thought I don't really think she should she should have helped them."
705.0,Provider,"Well, I am."
16914.0,Patient,"I mean for them, I mean for them, I mean like I don't get it, I mean like there's I mean yeah I get it going and everyone is entitled to be helped and everything, but you know what I mean, but this dude is like um. what's what's the word you ever heard how people could be like a smooth talker there are you call someone real slick."
705.0,Provider,uh huh.
16914.0,Patient,"yeah let's describe it, but yeah that's how this guy can be. Okay, oh."
705.0,Provider,i'm glad that you're where you are right.
16914.0,Patient,"Now, and the funny thing is that she still wants to be friends with the sky. Now funny like the first is like the middle where she men were actually nice to each other. it's all. it's all Nice and happy, but then the minute we don't get along it's like we were like have a state where out a standoff and like she has like her boyfriend like she only talks to me unless she's going off for her stupid beers. are like when she's in the car like when she's on her. Her on. Her phone on. speaker phone in the car with your kids never he never does what she's in the House with with her. When when she when her on her boyfriend slash partners around and his and her boyfriend's kid is around never around them, you know that it's as if she's embarrassed to have talked me helping me around them, you know that mean."
705.0,Provider,"And I think that some of those. I was just going to say Susan I think that some of those things you know if you want to start jotting down. Things that you feel like that you want to work on, while you're in therapy, I think that would be good, because that sounds like that that's definitely something that you thought a lot about and then you have some pretty strong feelings about."
16914.0,Patient,Now it's like yeah you know it does a lot of things.
705.0,Provider,"yeah yeah so you and I, how how we do this system today and I appreciate to because you had already provided a lot of additional information."
16914.0,Patient,"Every time we just just every time meet her get along with like four or even like a while like. yeah everything's good and then all of a sudden, she does something like that, like the like the irritating of further you know me like."
705.0,Provider,"yeah. And then, what will happen is next you and I will set up for individual session."
16914.0,Patient,"And then, some of them are upon what we we ever really truly get along. Like has never ever a time we can ever really like i'm sorry to say this, I mean like. The only reason why she's even friends me a face, because because she is because she's literally related to me as a sister, I mean other than that I wouldn't have around unfriend I wouldn't be friends on Facebook i'm sorry to say this."
