Getting have my back that discipline them. So James the older one despise me like you wouldn't believe or he hated me. And I believe that he gotten something as head. and told selena about our past and our drug addiction. And i'm kind of wondering if that has a little pea has i'm not blaming it all on him. But with whatever he said to her to make me look bad that has a play in it.
