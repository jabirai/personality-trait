ID,Role,Message
105.0,Provider,He says a tough one tough mornin. ya hard week. And my meeting with you.
2173.0,Patient,I don't know about.
105.0,Provider,"Okay okay so we're not sure. All right, um. Do you want to start with what's going on, do you feel like I need to sort of share what it is."
2173.0,Patient,we're right on the precipice and our livers.
105.0,Provider,feeling depressed.
2173.0,Patient,yeah. Where. Are you having trouble hearing.
105.0,Provider,yeah just a little bit.
2173.0,Patient,we're not doing well.
105.0,Provider,"or not okay. Well, that can be scary."
2173.0,Patient,yeah it is considering we're supposed to.
105.0,Provider,what's the hesitation for Adrian to join today what's his concern.
2173.0,Patient,He promised that he would.
105.0,Provider,Okay.
2173.0,Patient,He promised me on Sunday that he did on personal counselor and that he would do couples counseling with me.
105.0,Provider,Okay. Are you able to to do the work today. comfortably. In the apartment are you able to do that responded.
2173.0,Patient,"Yes, i'll do it. Neither one. Okay, so Saturday Adrian goes that was. A big thing for us because of the past experiences i've told you about where he's gone out with these particular friends. And it's resulted a. drunken fight with me every single time for him not telling me where he is when he's there. So this time I was hopeful that it would go good, and it did it went fine like I dropped him off, I went to love that. Like 1145 30 okay on the 30. And as soon as we get in the car he starts bringing up stuff that I did when I was on pills, and when him and I were split up and not technically together. And tells me and I asked him to stop repeatedly I said, if you want to talk about this let's talk about this tomorrow and you're sober and I was over, she said, please stop please stop please stop please stop. He didn't respect any of those boundaries, I tried to set and just continued to go around and around and around and I have a six minute recording of him telling me basically that i'm a slut. And that he's tormented every single night by what I did, and that he'll never forgive me, told me Fuck you flipped me off. I mean it was emotional abuse it was emotional terrorism. and on Sunday, he agreed with all this, he was crying begging me to stay with him telling me he would do counseling telling me that he was going to try. And then i'm like I was like, no, no, no, no, no, he showed up where I was cleaning trash and was like please babe give me another chance, please, so I said okay upon these conditions, I will do this Monday rolls around. In the evening, everything was good, I went to pull by myself, I came back, I did not drink it all, when I was there I came back. We have sex, I was in the shower he was in the bathroom and then I asked him if he had established a therapist So what is he was planning on doing it. And I asked him a third question that was a girl or female, yes, we got upset about my schedule yeah I asked if you could do it during the day, so that didn't cut into our time in the evenings. He got pissed off that I was asking questions and immediately flipped it."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so if we're going to do this, a meeting together let's meet together."
2173.0,Patient,She wants to see you. Okay.
105.0,Provider,"So we'll move let's move the screen back a little bit, and this is the it does sound like they're starting to give out have some some plans to. Get are you thinking of getting a couples therapist someone that you know because there's this risk Adrian I don't know if you feel it right because. brittany's my client right and i'm doing the couples work as as an. intervention to address stressors so that I mentioned, right up front, so this is this might be the point where you start to think about having some someone to work with outside of me. I like working with you guys, I think I think it's been effective and I want to do something with you today. But keep that in mind this this might be rising to the top where that that might be necessary, because Adrian you might just start feeling a little. Like i'm bias does that ever come up in you. Know Okay, but."
2173.0,Patient,"But that's what that's exactly what I told bringing I was like. My issue that I had when I snapped by air. it's not. it's not her Those are my internal issues right and I told her hey that's why I get my account Sir. yeah and and I also need my counselor because. have very short fuse when it comes on saying things, and the same thing, I have the same views. that she has in a way, whenever like. When you're when you're when your significant other ask you for something. When a situation where like I don't want you to ask me for anything."
105.0,Provider,uh huh.
2173.0,Patient,"Or, or like, for example, like the whole night, like the whole going out thing. Yes, I messed up but it's not I was thinking about it and. Whenever I feel that she's insecure and I whenever I feel like she's interrogating me I. It frustrates me it annoys me it really like upsets me, so I know for a fact whenever I got in the car she was asking him about some girls."
105.0,Provider,uh huh.
2173.0,Patient,"And and and and I was like hey no Those are my friends girls, they just shut up to pick them up. So I know that. A minute initial reaction is like yo like i'm not doing anything wrong, and I was wasted and somehow I ended up using. kind of like comparing myself to her and saying hey you don't have to worry about anything and then she tells me shut up she's like yeah I can stay up till two o'clock in the morning because you don't do this shit to. me because I don't do this to you and she's right now the next day but."
105.0,Provider,"So I have, I have a suggestion. I know it really feels very or I imagine it feels very relevant that this particular event. Is at central. But my suspicion is that there are bigger energies at play, and if you don't mind today, maybe instead we could share a little bit about. Your fears of moving in together. I know it's off topic, but let's see what happens if we stopped talking about."
2173.0,Patient,"i've already told them i'm terrified to give up my space, because I don't feel. Like we communicate well. She doesn't want. been with me, because I am her piece killer I came here to ruin her sanctuary I did I said since you've been and we began began arguing in this space that it's no longer that for me it's turning into what I escaped with my world. which was an unhealthy. Toxic environment that's what I thought that's not what you said, but Okay, I understand I did say that on Sunday, when you and I were talking about everything. I can't. say anything I I feel like everything i'm saying is wrong, so this is the reason why i'm the way I am."
105.0,Provider,So just listen just listen to me for a second.
2173.0,Patient,"Well, if I can i'll gladly listened to you, but if she interjects, then I can say anything I can do anything."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so Brittany do your best to to not be communicating non verbally your disapproval of what he's saying or your disagreement, if you can, and I know it's hard, because you don't agree, and neither does he you are two separate people, everyone is different. And we're sometimes doing two things at the same time we're doing our best to be honest and our Defense mechanism is also right there trying to self protect it is, it is very complicated. And this is a scary moment guys have a lot at stake, you have said you're going to move in together. And i'm guessing each of you is afraid Adrian I can I can see, or I think I see that. You don't like right now you're not saying how how you're feeling you're talking about kind of her reaction, could you just say to me anyway, before we do talking to each other, could you just say to me. What you're afraid of anything in maybe in yourself, you know you're talking about hey I have a short fuse. Maybe fears I don't know. Maybe she'll leave maybe she'll never leave I, like my space I don't like space and Let me close or whatever they are. they're yours and i'm interested in knowing what they are. But there'll be no more safety from her then she's I think agreeing to just do her best to not be shaking her head and interrupt you right with these Meta communications, if you can persevere and see if you can just say what you're afraid of what your concerns are."
2173.0,Patient,i'm afraid that this thing's not going to get fixed. I got a house. Please her. And this is going to be a waste.
105.0,Provider,Okay got house uh huh okay so Where would you like to live.
2173.0,Patient,"Anyway, as long as as long as it's it's a home as long as I have a house."
105.0,Provider,"Okay home, so I just get the terms, clear, you have a mortgage now."
2173.0,Patient,i'm getting a mortgage on the 28th I quote.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so are you saying you don't care if you have a mortgage versus rental they're the same to you."
2173.0,Patient,"know not necessary Well, yes and no when it comes down to the money wise, yes, but owning something is completely different it's an investment so i'm happy about that."
105.0,Provider,But an investment okay.
2173.0,Patient,"yeah but I wouldn't do this I picked all these houses to try to impress her because all the help that we looked at, have to be specific, what bring you wanted. Specifically, what she wanted."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, what. To notice today it's gonna it'll be a challenge but see if you can keep circling back to what your fear is so see if you can say it i'm afraid. What."
2173.0,Patient,"i'm not necessarily afraid, is just. i'm not afraid of her moving in with me i'm not afraid of anything if she doesn't want to move in with me, I can do it by myself so i'm really not afraid. What what would what i'm concerned about is the fact that. She is not going to feel like like how she said right now it's she's gonna feel like it's not I feel like she's not going to feel like it's your sanctuary um. it's very hard to to I can just imagine if if if I live in her house now. and Things are not done a certain way. i'm not going to be able to turn around into and tiger like oh hey, we need to do this because it's it's it's my house now it's our House now, and I feel like there's going to be something there in trends in translation were. Like she already said it she's like. I need my freedom you don't give me my freedom, I need my piece. So. yeah that's what i'm afraid of i'm afraid of the fact that. This is not going to change, I am 19 and be able to tolerate highlight if you or give her tips or giver. or like blusher it's like how she pushes me it's like or like you would push me you'd say something like hey Adrian if you're having a rough day let's let's think about this way or hey if you are. If you're feeling bad about yourself there's different ways that you can make yourself better like maybe go to the gym go on a walk you eat healthier. As a man as me right, but as a female. A lot of females in general, just they just like they. They vent about how unsatisfied there with life with the event, about how satisfied, they are with themselves or their events on how unsatisfied their with their significant other. But I feel like some people don't do anything regards to that they just want to sit there and they just want to live in that bubble, and they need a burst out of it. So when I when I see my beautiful girlfriend when I see my beautiful significant other and she's constantly like bashing on herself or she's constantly upset over traffic that day that she said that she went to to pull in and that she had an hour or Tuesday. i'm going to type of person like if if i'm frustrated out a call at a customer she'll tell me Hadrian chill out like. you're frustrated chill. Like show Tommy and i'm like okay cool I need I need and i'll do that. she's the type of person that walks in slamming doors throwing your keys throwing your boots punching the air, because there was construction on wyoming. And the minute I say something i'm like hey. what's going on leave me alone i'm frustrated. And to me it's just like. What about when I get frustrated, what about whenever I feel interrogated and i'm telling you hey I feel interrogated right now I feel frustrated right now. And it's like oh Adrian you need to watch where you're saying when you need me to pause and analyze that when it comes down to her, she doesn't she doesn't pause and analyze either like it's like. i'm just like, why is it Okay, for you to tell me that. you're frustrating me, and you can force me if I don't want to talk to you right now, you can force anything on me, why is it Okay, for her to tell me that, but when I tell her like hey I don't want to talk about this it's like no, we need to talk about this."
105.0,Provider,"So if neither of you changed at all, do you want to move in together."
2173.0,Patient,"See The thing is, is I that's what that's what my My point is it looks like in this relationship, I have to give in 100% and then this take it with with everything because."
105.0,Provider,"If I may. That was a self imposed. doctrine for you, I know it feels like it, because you're motivated to keep the relationship. But each of you made a decision about what you're willing to compromise on. And Adrian I listened to you, and it is wearing on you you're compromising more than you want to and you worded differently, you say, I have to do this i'm not allowed to i'm not allowed to notice that right. it's still. That that language says, I need brittany's permission."
2173.0,Patient,mm hmm yeah.
105.0,Provider,"But that's that's still an illusion that's still that's still not real. I get I get that don't be a consequence, I get that. But yours, but watch that's happening this, this is, this is the the reality of it. Brittany is managing her emotions, the way she is, and you have, however, you do it, I don't know all the stories, but just here today, you can acknowledge some some short fuse behavior I don't know what all it is. We want so badly to say is there this other way for us to be, but the way you are now, this is real, this is real, you might be over compromising. You might just be doing that you might be waiting to get permission and permission to you might be we're going to act and handle things exactly the same way I don't think that's ever going to happen. If you guys come from right. So the way when you filter through we've gone through this before, which was something like. Oh, this is how I view it, this is my filter how come you don't see the world the same way, I do, how come you don't Act, the same way, you know. or this you know it's hypocritical right, I say hey just chill out it's not as bad as you think this moment will pass we're really good from the outside, giving advice, but when we're in our moments we're throwing things punching the air threatening to get up. That happens that happened in this relationship that's real, but the the the the idea that, for example, i'm outside of this relationship it's going to be. ever so easy for me to be able to stay in my prefrontal cortex and say this is how you need to say it, this is what you need to do, but when you are triggered. by your amygdala you're not thinking straight, so of course it's easier if i'm the one who's home and i'm already chill and someone comes in upset I can see things I can I have access to words. And that rational mind of mine i'm not emotionally activated So these are different parts of the brain being access does that make sense i'm still the same person, but i'm going to think more rationally when i'm not emotionally activated. So i'll be able to give someone else advice, because i'm already chill. it's not that people are deliberately saying you know, this is one sided I get to be this way, but you have to be this other way oftentimes that's quite unconscious."
2173.0,Patient,"No it's not it's it hasn't been said, like that boom my relationship is one sided 100%."
105.0,Provider,"And do you own that you compromise, maybe early on, because he thought I don't know I want this woman, I. I like being generous I like there are people that like doing it they're like I want to be accommodating I I have an enemy to give um but maybe Adrian maybe you went a little too far, or maybe you're changing maybe you're like. I want to do it quite that much or maybe that maybe the difference in behavior is irritating you that she may not be doing the same thing, and maybe you're expecting the same thing, a lot of people have that will like a happy relationship is we just. Give the same amount we just you help me i'll help you and then we'll both be helped, I mean there's we have yeah that one."
2173.0,Patient,"So So what do. I get what you're saying. But I know that there's relationships, where they come from different backgrounds and I know that people some someone has to give. People have to get with a relationship whoa okay I don't feel I feel i'm afraid that I always give everything in from mine and I feel like you don't give him from your end. might have when said I am I like to help people I like to take care of people, I want to make sure that everybody's Okay, well then don't feel resentful about doing it."
105.0,Provider,On you that's the key so that's the key you hearing that so that's why i'm wondering Adrian if maybe you've been giving more than you have to give.
2173.0,Patient,"yeah actually I have because I cook I clean. But I have expectations that the House has to be clean before she comes home like Sometimes I feel like i'm a housemaid like Sometimes I feel like i'm on my mom when I was little like. Like it's it's it's crazy when they're like imagine if you are in your sanctuary right now you're working and then your significant other comes in, and then I don't know where just slams the fridge and says. you're here all day at least fill out the ice cubes but you never use the ice cubes. And i'm just like shit yo what did I fucking do like."
105.0,Provider,"So instead of so stay there, because we gotta we gotta grab Ahold of something so instead of shit what did I do."
2173.0,Patient,I did say that.
105.0,Provider,"I know we got we got to start. Somewhere you what you did instead of saying a feeling he gave me a little story. So instead right it's just a little story is to represent the feeling, once you tell me what that feeling is fridge door slammed why don't you fill up the ice cubes I don't care whether this even happened it's such a great example i'm not i'm not it's it's symbolic. So. Okay."
2173.0,Patient,"I feel, not happy when that happens."
105.0,Provider,"Okay hold on we're gonna we're gonna going slow gets us going further so. Do you feel just don't give me a story just yesterday, what did you do you feel guilty, yes or no. Okay, so there's nothing to defend is that right. You neither did ice cube use so never was in your conscious to know whether it was empty or full like you had no awareness like you're just sort of like jaw drop no idea let's just pretend that's the case."
2173.0,Patient,"He filled up my water thing for me the morning for an empty string which I didn't know he used all the ice. Okay, he knew. That it was trying to get back until the following morning good work it's not my responsibility to make your breakfast it's not my responsibility to stop fucking doing it, I do it because I helped you because. You thought in my things I can do it myself I taking care of myself my whole life I do it because you get up. Like, for example, I get grouchy because I tried to explain to him i'm not a morning person he gets up his mind turns on he wants to be chatty Cathy and talk about the House stuff talk about real stuff and I cannot do that and I tried to explain that to him and he doesn't get it. I tried to explain to him last night when he brought up. We were having a good night I asked him to come, take a shower with me and in the shower he brings up how i'm not cooking i'm not getting up early enough i'm not doing my. Like making my breakfast and stuff for work nope he brought up how he thought I was mad at him because he decided to get up and go to the gym instead of filling up my water container which I was not. At all I wasn't mad about it at all, it is that way and and and and then I explained to him it's my turn to talk you just got to talk you interrupted me but okay good. I explained to him, I feel ashamed when you bring up X, Y Z that i'm not doing, because I know I need to do it and i'm struggling to take care of myself okay. And i'm barely getting by getting up to work out doing with my mom and my sister posted during my weekly trust because ain't going to pull me but i'm barely able to function. And you expect all of me, explaining that to him and he still popped off for another hour I still don't understand like when."
105.0,Provider,I don't I know you down but.
2173.0,Patient,"I will never understand that i'll never understand that, because. My grandpa died last month my best friend killed himself last month my little cousin just died got killed this last week in Mexico my dad lives in the same city. My dad is by himself I haven't seen my Daddy in years I don't send him money I don't have them I don't do anything she doesn't sit there and worry and say oh. i'm going through all these things, what about you, Adrian What about the House what about you moving in here, what about your fighting What about your sister What about this no i'm trying to let her know that I don't understand you because. You say all those things but yeah you come at me like I need to fill the What if I was to tell you, like oh i'm sorry Brittany, I have so much things I can't I don't want to get up in the morning because i'm so depressed and i'm so this. But, yet you still come here and attack me or make me feel like i'm attack because. I didn't feel your ice trays or because the traffic was a certain way. We all have Adrian."
105.0,Provider,"and Brittany. You either do not like one another's became. Or you like it i'm going to keep it very, very simple for a moment. Adrian did you like the way she spoke, I just want to stay with ice tray it's just such a good example whether it happened or not. These content aside there's going to be another one, and another one, and another one that's what you guys all want to talk about she said she said, get it right get it right. And I don't see your way, this will stay exactly as it is, if we don't break it down and see there's another angle on this, did you like, how you were spoken to yes or no. No then that's where you can start Britney the town, I know."
2173.0,Patient,I don't know.
105.0,Provider,"I don't know what you do after that, but I don't know how long you hold on to it because it is not just once it is multiple steps that happened. So walk through and you're going to need to own whether you're doing if you if you right now choose I i'm already doing everything perfectly the okay So here we go, we got the ice tray and you say. wow ouch. don't like the tone i'm feeling attacked and you shut up you just shush, this is the key you shush. And you guys have heard me say this before, if you say I feel. diminished unimportant. wouldn't when when I hear you speaking to me this way with the tongue and you. guys have heard this before what is needed next see if you guys can remember that what is needed, maybe from Brittany right then."
2173.0,Patient,they're going.
105.0,Provider,"To care. This is really an interesting piece, I think. If this relationship is not about re capitulating our childhood, which I do believe most relationships are that. But if you're going to do it exactly the same way, you might get the same outcome So what if you did it differently. Brittany, is all he did was do that piece ouch that hurt i'm going to go take care of myself and maybe he walks out of the room goes for a little walk he just."
2173.0,Patient,So.
105.0,Provider,"This yeah it's hard, because both of you do the same thing, both of you, you do it to each other and then and it's happening here to."
2173.0,Patient,But I can go on a walk though that's what I that's why I shake my head like.
105.0,Provider,"you're a grown ass man, you should."
2173.0,Patient,"know I yesterday, I told her like i'm leaving. And I let I let."
105.0,Provider,My boy. This is my point.
2173.0,Patient,Did I stop you from leaving how.
105.0,Provider,"You want it. You guys are not you're not getting it because. you're going over memory keep going over i'm right both of you are working so hard to can't take this in. Take this in. Brittany, it may be there's some hard realities here, it may be, you don't care that you just hurt his feelings. Whether his psychology means that his button is bigger and more sensitive it doesn't matter if you do not care that's relevant are you taking that in. It matters now, one, at a time, all i'm doing is one side of this and, yes, very easily we can shift it the other way and i'll be able to say something that you said, and do you care. to stress. Do he just Microsoft I know it's so slow and want to get to all the ways that we're right over here, but if there's not a chair, what do we do, where do we go."
2173.0,Patient,on either side.
105.0,Provider,"And there it is again, this is a power struggle you guys are in who needs who war, and it is scary and that's why I asked this morning how scary is it to be moving in because this might be getting amplified not consciously."
2173.0,Patient,don't. punches. There were some.
105.0,Provider,"Trying to answer my question I know it's scary but somebody has to speak first you can't literally or I could say on your mark get set go both of you do you care when you hurt one another. And you mark get set go right, I mean it's a silly way to do it somebody's got to speak first so Brittany, whatever it doesn't matter that there's a ledger I deserve to speak to you, poorly because you didn't feel the ice cubes when you put the water in the what. It doesn't work like that we don't get to have a ledger and now i'm deserving and i've worked up enough, and now I can say something, do you care that he was hurting."
2173.0,Patient,Not in that moment no.
105.0,Provider,"Do you think that that has some relevance to this relationship that these little because that's what this relationship is their little moment after moment after little moment, and then we have a relationship. It matters. Are you interested to know that in that moment, you may not care about his feelings. Because you're may be consumed by yours, because they're so big."
2173.0,Patient,I cannot even focus on their emotional.
105.0,Provider,"So Adrian and want I know you're nodding your head and that's validating to hear that, but do you understand, and you get all the way through this maze hold on ready Adrian. it's very possible that ain't going to change and I don't know what the number is tomorrow, three months I don't know you get to like it, you get to not like it, but you're having to. hurt back right and now she hurt and back and forth and back and forth exactly how is that going to be this loving relationship, you get to say no, these are hard truths right, we have to go inside and say I don't I don't like this feeling like this. This is, is this not real is this not your lives together, right here, you guys and it's only one little. tiny thing it may not even happen to the way I said it, because it doesn't matter if you guys are not turning to each other, even though you're in a thing, each of you, in your own thing and be able to say. I can see outside myself, I can see that I am not good company. i'm a mess. i'm just steer clear. Or, and if you don't like it, you have a choice, but this is about compatibility isn't it, this is like I either want to live with this person or not. But these are real Adrian you are who you are, and yes, of course, we're going to change. But not 100% overnight. These are hard to look at and are you willing to look at it right now before you move in or I don't care move in and then work it out, but. If you don't like something, you see, you have decisions to make. Adrian you've been giving away your power she's busy maybe taking care of herself and doesn't even know it's happening there's so many things going on, I just named one there's so many. But ultimately don't we come down to. I either learn how to take care of myself when I see my girlfriend working through something difficult she's not going to take in my help. i'm going to go do take care of myself and see what happens to manipulate but live your life because you're operating system your normal one of give. It isn't being received i'm assuming not the way you are expecting it's not appreciated it doesn't sound like in the moment but it doesn't make you writer better. And maybe maybe Brittany will lose out Maybe she lose out on you. But that's her right and it's your right to protect yourself. To understand each of you have your own line and if you've been doing things that you enjoy finding out oh i'm growing i'm learning how to be. something different for maybe Adrian it's you it's i'm learning how to to turn that waiting for permission off and oh no I I give myself permission well that hurt ouch and you go take care of yourself. Of course you can go. course you can everything is a consequence, but if you think. Oh now i'm gonna have a negative consequence, what do I think about that, what do we think about this relationship that that's the case you get to have that opinion but it doesn't make it better than it doesn't make your writer that. This is just about is there a flow is there some compatibility and sometimes there is. Pretty your need to take care of yourself in the morning right, I mean that's that's the way you need it. it's not better than his way but it happens, and it has a consequence, you see that right, you might be pushing him away. And you do that. You guys have an interest if you step, all the way back. way back the basics Britney you are different than Adrian he has this resilience and has this ability to show up. Right and doesn't doesn't have this quite the same sensitivity and it's a neat little opposite attract kind of thing but you're not letting it in. It would be convenient if you let it in. Because you guys are not the same."
2173.0,Patient,"yeah we have a rule, right now, it started this week, where I can interact with her, for the first two hours of the morning and say it was a rule."
105.0,Provider,"Okay. Well, we can't play that game. It has to be is it is it, I asked you not to because i'm not a morning person."
2173.0,Patient,"On a morning person, so if you could not talk to me about important serious things in the morning, that would be appreciated and he takes that as me setting a rule. or babe when you say hey i'm not a morning person, please honor active me, for the first two hours in the morning exactly like that."
105.0,Provider,"It doesn't matter Brittany, it is a role he did."
2173.0,Patient,He did it's like me telling you hey don't wake me up in the mornings. it's like. Oh that's.
105.0,Provider,All we say okay well i'll do my best.
2173.0,Patient,"But then my self conscious X up and i'm like babe or you're not talking to me because I didn't do the water and that's when i'm like oh snap are you upset me because you didn't text me back and i'm just like. i'm sorry like I should have told her i'm sorry. And i'll tell i'll tell you i'll tell you when i'll tell you straight up in front of her. I humiliated her, I told the things I should never tell her I let go I brought up something from two years ago that I shouldn't be bringing back, but I told her hey. Those are my insecurities or those are things that I wonder, and I didn't have a clarification or. And and that's my and I told her That was my bad because that was two years ago. I was like that's very to me that's very childish, because I was like I didn't I can't believe I let that little thing sent me off, and I went off on her, and I have the recording to it, it sucks what I tell her is such to tell her all those things. But. it's actually told me that's really how you felt. and i'm not i'm not a perfect guy or anything but i'll do anything for her. i'll get up in the middle of night i'll go pick up her sister she wants me to all take her sister to to to appointments if she wanted me to i'll go pick up her mom while she has an accident i'll go take her guys if I needed to but that's me. And and. it's like you said yeah i'm used to giving i'm used to giving and giving and giving and giving and. I never get I feel like I never get anything in return, not, not just in general, my whole family my dad my brother everybody I feel like. Everybody just wants something for me and I don't get anything back in return, the only thing I want is tranquility, the only thing is for me to able to do my nine to five. And some something might happen to her throughout the whole day she comes in, in a different energy and like you said. it's hard for me to gauge if i'm in a in a in a in a good section or in a good moment it's hard for me to understand why the traffic got to you or why the ice cubes got to you so."
105.0,Provider,"Because of traffic there's a piece of psychology that's still it I don't think I don't know if either of you get this, we have a history. mm hmm that history. Is what dials up tiny little ice cube traffic things the actual trigger what it's doing is the physiological and emotional memory of our those more traumatizing events if they smell taste look even slightly like it and those live unconscious. we're going to be reacting, as if it was that old stuff it's not about the ice cube."
2173.0,Patient,"it's more like. topic so it's more like kind of like a frequency, in a way. That you accidentally step on once you step on it you're like oh it's that kind of similar frequency."
105.0,Provider,"Listen listen, listen to the difference. Listen to the difference you're hot watch what your brain and each of you might be doing this, I don't know choose look at this person walk in the room. And you go why you why you fussing over traffic you you run you tend to run it through your filter just as nothing but a thing like this bigger things to worry about. You may run it through that but you project your filter and expect others to use the same one we don't we don't she has hers. I have mine, they have his BA BA BA so that's one hurdle, you may want to consider is, and secondly what's happening is it maybe the felt experience of helplessness. it's not traffic what gets triggered perhaps, and it could be any number of things. can be helplessness stuck trapped so i'm in a car can't move, I want to be at point B, I want to rest I, and there are some physical it has nothing to do with traffic, it has to do with how she's doing see how you're nodding your head, if you walk. She walks in the door. Or is in the kitchen remember doesn't matter whether it's ice tray or traffic it's watch here's the difference, I see this woman, I care about she's in distress you guys complicated with content trying to be right, but it is not that it is my poor darlin. Now watch it's not just that my poor darlin my gosh what you're going through it's also you you're there to there may be times when you're the poor darlin and it's I don't have it to give I. it's so big maybe the animation so big and something is thrown or there's a door and you get activated you don't lose your right to care about you. Both of you have those rights and we have varying degrees of how much we have to give to other. And you may be depleted, because you might be giving giving giving giving that one time that's it I can't I think giving all morning let's say I don't have it, to give you look like you're really going through something. I I don't know how to take care of it right now i'm going to go for a walk all i'm doing is animating another way of being that it's not about how ridiculous, is it this traffic get over yourself it's about how much we have to give and and do we care. And this works for both of you obviously but a little different presentation."
2173.0,Patient,Well i'm just thinking about how.
105.0,Provider,"Pretty what is it what is the tape you're running right now, what are you saying, and I really just want to hear from you, for a minute saying yourself right, you know how dark is."
2173.0,Patient,One in my life I don't want to be here.
105.0,Provider,Is it because i'm saying i'm Am I heading on.
2173.0,Patient,"Taking his wife inside of pissing me off for you to shoot his arrow down the road and nobody's fucking seeing it from my perspective that I just don't have to do. Sorry, if. You love being out."
105.0,Provider,It doesn't it's just the first part that last one is the troublemaker it's the get the Fuck out saying that one no I.
2173.0,Patient,won't even do this anymore.
105.0,Provider,This is hard this you guys have your stories I know this is hard I wish I could hand you the recipe to just do the care thing because so notice Adrian I.
2173.0,Patient,I stopped asking them to do so in the morning i'm trying to explain. How. So that he doesn't think. Doing these fucking things to him that he's making a head.
105.0,Provider,I see yeah yeah.
2173.0,Patient,"i'm not. happy with that, and then I can't be listened to him screaming at me at one in the morning about how i'm a piece of shit. yeah. And then to promise me other shit and try to take it back a day later. I don't feel. Like I can even be."
105.0,Provider,"So. I, and I can see how you think I was, I was taking sides. But the phenomenon, I have to choose to talk to one person or another and that's the challenge and that's when I. i'm concerned."
2173.0,Patient,"sides because she actually told me how I did it yeah i'm not even because she's right i'm not even because she'll be right to get. You Brittany, you said, we were going to do this together, you made me get out of bed for this, and when. When it's just coming."
105.0,Provider,"To just feelings, this is hard a shame activations happening it's it's not about someone sitting down not sitting down this is hard she's feeling ganged up on."
2173.0,Patient,It but. What I really feel your word don't talk to it when like that she's not doing anything to you she's at the party. He doesn't care about my shame i've explained my shame and I still get yelled at.
105.0,Provider,"yeah I can see that that was a really big risk I took and it does scare me I don't want to be someone you push away too, but. We can we can go back because I don't I don't want remember, I was saying, I was starting to think it was maybe meeting the couple's fees to go somewhere, maybe also that."
2173.0,Patient,"No, no, what did you say we wanted to do count couples counseling. They start this that you don't want to do it, I didn't want to go back on everything you promised me when I was ending our relationship, I was done, I am done, I am trying not to be known, because you made me xyz fucking promise that you're going to try. So i'm sorry i'm sorry if I if I did anything wrong baby i'm sorry. me, and when I had a conversation, and she gave me some pointers on how I need to react whenever those things happen, and maybe you took that personal but that's not what she meant she was telling me Adrian i've been saying the same things to. Brittany like how she said it we're not going to change from one day to another know you have me postured in your brain is your enemy and I don't see that fucking changing at all. I don't see me being able to care about your feelings when I am emotionally activated and for the record I am going through my hormonal shift and started my period literally yesterday so that's why it's been harder for me this week. But you don't understand those things I can explain them to you, over and over and over and over. And you don't get it, you still expect all the ship for me in those moments that I can't give you what I expect. What you expect me to give you that same treatment whenever i'm going to my shit i'm going to my sheet right now and I don't treat you differently. I don't sit here and tell you I was getting drunk you get belligerently drunk with your friends and you come back and emotionally abused me I, and I am sorry about that I was a complete different kind, I was in a really good. I was in a really good mood when I picked you up, I was feeling really peaceful I had spent the night by myself reading my fucking books, I understand that Bernie and I fucked it up, I said some fucked up shit. That was not about this particular situation, it was about another person that is completely separate for the weekend my mental instability, so if you can't. deal with the repercussions, then I don't know what to say so, like I said I dealt with that, and then I didn't you started arguing with me Monday night you argued with me yesterday you argue with me last night. If you think Monday was an argument is because I told you, I was frustrated and I didn't leave I know frustrated that you're asking me questions about therapy. Know Britney you I started told you about Max just know asked a few questions because I asked for information let's let's do this. As soon as you walked in the House, I told you baby I got my I got my counseling I got my therapist I did you why why didn't you hear that Britney, as you said, I was emotionally activated from the traffic and then I was in the shower and I couldn't hear you. know you were activated by the traffic and then I immediately got in the shower and then, when I was when I was like did you get a therapist and I don't know I even asked, because I couldn't hear him. and apparently that's when he told me so when I because I feel and I felt ignored, I felt like you didn't care about me at that moment. So why are you going to care about me this moment, and now that I don't want to talk about it, you want to talk about it and it's like last night. You straight up told me look Adrian i'm done I don't want to talk about this you're frustrating me. I don't want to talk about this you're not going to force me into a conversation You said something like that and i'm like wow. Why is it Okay, for you to say those things but whenever i'm telling you hey babe, this is actually going to frustrate me I don't want to talk about it it's like no you don't have. That subconsciously that's what you think, but I do it with that I straight up told you, I feel it I feel interrogated I feel frustrated right now, and you went off on me on because I said. it's always something like that bit, and if you want me to give him i'll give in, but like he said, but like I said, like I said. i'll give him, but do you really want that, do you really want that barely staging and not to do anything and then all of a sudden, like like how she said. I will walk away why because I give everything and I don't give anything in return, even with my personal situations, even with my dad situation, though theme that triggered the dena worries me the most is my dad right now. And you haven't even question or asked me anything about it and I keep on bringing it up. You don't care. Okay, I don't care so let's just be done. You."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so. I. I do think that you've both been kind of exposed to one woman's approach, at least through telemedicine. I would say that it might be time to explore a separate. therapist for couples work because my concern is what got activated and I don't know that we won't use this because we've had difficult moments Brittany before were able to come around and use it, I think it's a useful grist for the mill moment. But all of a sudden, I did get a little concerned. That that might loyalty, in a sense might. look like it's somewhere else. Is my loyalty is to. Happy people. You know, to to joy to, and this is hard guys bring it difficult history, each of you. out here it's easy for me to say. you're going through something each of you, at the same time and it's just inconvenient, but it doesn't feel like that to each of you. As simple as not hearing from one shower when someone's talking like oh I didn't hear it, oh no that sucks I really wanted to hear this answer, nothing is light like that it's not like it's so heavily weighted on you don't love me. so heavily weighted on that."
2173.0,Patient,don't understand me that's it yeah. Man I don't.
105.0,Provider,And it doesn't.
2173.0,Patient,"matter so, but how once again it's the reason why I don't understand us, because we come from different backgrounds, because no one has ever taken care of me i've always been by myself, since I was 16. Right, the person that didn't care. But you want to be taken care of. Now favorite so it's not like that. No, you don't have anybody, neither do I I don't want my mom I don't have any fun. You can call it whatever please like it stay right now okay call with you and we break that I have nowhere to go either you act like I have all this support. Or what was the rule, you said that you're going to be paying rent. Three months for free, so that you can get your money and move out remember, though, that wasn't, a role that was a compromise, we made when you were trying to continue this relationship and I ended it. I said I don't feel comfortable moving in with you. I didn't come up with the three months I did because I I don't feel comfortable moving in with you, without a safety net Okay, because of our fighting and the things you said to me last night that you can never forgive me that you're tormented every single night by. The stuff I did when I was addicted to drugs. But you use Why would it logically makes sense for me to move in with you i'm not stupid it doesn't logically makes sense, it sounds like a terrible idea on paper it's a horrible idea it's a horrible idea. Then I understand why I said I need a few months to save some extra money if i'm going to make this decision to do this with you. We need to do couples counseling every week, you need your own counselor to deal with your anger issues and and the stuff that I, apparently, my apologies and me, trying to explain myself has very worked."
105.0,Provider,"Would that be okay. Since it there isn't this real flow yet between you two there isn't just this just deep leaning in of trust. Would that be okay that each of you manage your own sort of emotional boundary I don't know where that would fall for you, Adrian but for you, Brittany, it sounds like you want to have a question of money and Adrian I don't know what you might need to feel. But it's okay."
2173.0,Patient,i'm just happy to be alive.
105.0,Provider,Okay yeah.
2173.0,Patient,"i'm my mom died when I was six my ground everybody can hear me no it's true if you might go like this to me and everything but it's, the reality is the reality that I faced I let go of that i'm not gonna sit here and treat you bad just because. My dad shooter my mom like shit yeah you know, but you do know I don't um I got it Saturday night live pretty I have I haven't been around my mom and my dad. Since I was five years old. Okay. i'll tell you this. If we were to talk about my mom and my dad. I would be completely opposite of this you already know, I wouldn't let you work I would have you like, how you used to tell me you just want a little Mexican beach to cook you and clean for you all the time. If I was like my dad I would be that person, but i'm not i'm a first generation person who is actually dating somebody who is completely different than the background completely different every single one."
105.0,Provider,"I got I got a little lost you guys keep going over some content, I will say this, I suspect. i'm Brittany, is, I want to, I want to keep working with you don't don't abandon this Okay, I know it'll it'll be scary but keep showing up show up with me, I want to keep talking with you about what happened today. And I do think that you're I do think you have more insight Brittany, I just heard you here and that you can see you're starting to see. That that that dial gets real high with hormones with your psychology coming in and you just tried to do it, you gave a little analysis just now to Adrian I don't think he can see the connection. I know it's not intended to be an offense but I don't know if that you can see that your history your way right. It feeds and fuels your particular style of managing your emotions and your way of communicating mind does to everyone's does, and the more we understand it, and we can kind of have a narrative about it. The more we're humbled, we can say we can turn around a lot quicker and say Okay, I think this is coming from this, this is this and I better I better. not hurt you I don't want to hurt you and that that's the piece I think that's needed is catching it in itself and not hurting so i'm guessing Brittany, what you were trying to do was say i'm going to try not to hurt you Adrian i'm not a morning person keep the bar love for me. I don't know what else happened after that but it's coming from I don't want to hurt you Adrian. So and there's so much to do and talk about here my next client has been waiting for these 12 minutes, so I do need to go."
