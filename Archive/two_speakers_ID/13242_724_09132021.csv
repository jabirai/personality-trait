And she's not in the sessions waiting room, but I will continue to stand by. For transcription, the time is now. 143 inch. shore is now enter the waiting room."
13242.0,Patient,"hey sorry about that. hey what's up I know i'm a little late late, can you okay. sorry about that okay hi. Thanks for meeting with me today yeah."
724.0,Provider,I wasn't sure if I was.
13242.0,Patient,"On you hear me okay. um. what's going on not much about to end up in a. padded room. i'm in this House. um there's just a lot going on. So. I. You know, when I first got out of rehab I was. Extremely energetic I actually felt happy like whoa, this is what happy is. You know um I was going to sleep early I was waking up early I was you know going for long walks while it was still dark out. Just having like functional days. And I just feel like as they look back, like I. sort of just slowly. went downhill that's like. The communication, and you know, and I told I told my mother like an ultra sensitive now like I you know have like like I really felt very foreign. In myself, you know what I mean like I wasn't even used to how I was feeling, it was a lot safer in the rehab because everybody was like that. Everybody was on the same horrible yeah exactly vulnerable right. And it was safe there you know at at rehab I was able to just feel that way, all the time, every day, and it was okay."
724.0,Provider,Right.
13242.0,Patient,And here it's extremely unsafe.
724.0,Provider,See also.
13242.0,Patient,"Yes, like it's so unsafe that it's really like you know walking around and there's like landmines all over the place. You know. um. And I just like I saw that you know my functional waves just really started to go out the door I stopped communicating with you know my uncle he's. sober as well and he's like a chronic relax and he's really hung on to his sobriety this time, so he was really happy for me and I went from communicating with him less and less and everything just was like less happy and then the the depression grew. And then it sort of like. You know I felt like. My sensitive side and all that really was getting. Just really browbeat by you know my mom of all people it's like unfortunately now have to be honest with you chuck like with the last time we talked in you said to me like you can't let her get to you like that. When. You said that it made me feel like. It leaves me with a feeling of like don't you think if I could I would. Like you know I there's like a feeling of like not literally but there's an era of like inadequacy they're like Oh, you can do that, but I can't. You know any mean i'm not able to do that, you know, unfortunately, when you're when i'm in such close quarters with this woman and i'm taking a stroll and one of her fucking landmines. blow up in front here on me i'm not able to just not let it beat me up you know kind of like my first relationship ever when my boyfriend used to hit me and people would say don't let him eat you. For letting him. do anything. Right i'm not letting people verbally abuse me. So it made me kind of want to ask you a little bit about yourself."
724.0,Provider,"Well, I mean we don't have enough time for that I don't I mean the therapies and the focus."
13242.0,Patient,we're here for an hour.
724.0,Provider,"give up when we say these things like. yeah i'm. You know right so here's how it works, you know that you're not supposed to let them get to you, and when we tell you. don't let them get to you it's just a former like reinforce and we know that, like it's just like us being like yeah you need coping skills. And then just letting it hang like that it's like you're like yeah no shit I need coping skills, I don't know how to get coping skills. And, most of the time i'm up front with that where i'm, just like the only way to really a coping skills is through time and experience, and you have to experiencing all these heartaches. And the way that you respond to those that's how you become more efficient that's how you develop coping skills that's something I can teach you overnight you're like hell yeah so I say these things, because sometimes. People are only having those conversations in their head and sometimes when you hear it from somebody else it's like okay all right i'm not alone in this it's not to make you feel inadequate, quite the opposite it's supposed to like embolden you. Right. and understand that you're trapped in that situation, because you have nowhere to go, so now you're like stuck between a rock and a hard place and I don't have an answer for that, like I don't know how to get you out of that that position right because you don't."
13242.0,Patient,"Really it's not. To me, so I just i'm not and i'm not being like. You know i'm not being you know cheeky with you in any way the. Like you know when I tell you that, like, I am in a foreign sort of state of. hold on what I mean like a foreign service state of mind myself. When i'm can. you hear me OK."
724.0,Provider,I can't but it keeps cutting out like occasionally.
13242.0,Patient,"Okay, we should be a little better now um so yeah like when I say like him in sort of like a foreign like unfamiliar state of mind I I don't know how to always. before it was just like fighting words you know I would meet anger with anger and with her, I was always the dominant one the Alpha you know and, eventually, she would submit and run away. You know it's like do not Fuck with me because we're going to go and you started this shit and i'm going to finish it and it's like I don't want to do that anymore."
724.0,Provider,So you.
13242.0,Patient,know.
724.0,Provider,A lot of like the fight with her like it's just it's not worth the energy.
13242.0,Patient,"it's I just don't it's like a bad piece of meat like it got cut off and thrown in the trash I just don't have it in me anymore. I you know I go into my room and I cry now because I don't and I never used to cry never over anything. And it's like I that's how because i'm so frustrated I just don't know, like my feelings are hurt. Right, and so I don't know and I realized this the other night I was telling her something, and she was you know constantly you know, like. Defending herself and I was like i'm not attacking you she said, well, it feels like you are, and I was like. Just so that you know, once again, so that you know I am never on the prowl to attack you at all ever i'm just communicating with you i'm just letting know. You know, and so like it it's sort of like you know liars call people, you know that, so they say people lie to them thief's think people are stealing from them my mom is always on the attack so she's always being defensive when they say something to her. Because that's what she would do. Never like here's the thing with my mom that i've really come to realize, is that I am a walking talking human being, of her biggest failure in her mind in her life right like my little brother is the same thing, but the success of her life, you know."
724.0,Provider,She ever.
13242.0,Patient,Have him.
724.0,Provider,How she ever told you.
13242.0,Patient,"That ever never she would never admit to that never. You know, and as a result of that, like what actually did learning rehab was. And i'm going to use the word sick here but i'm sure you could fill in that space with whatever the above. broke my mom sort of wants to sort of have me in that sick position because. It leaves her to be able to take her resentment out on me, for you know the things that she had to deal with me throughout her life, all from starting at like a baby being pregnant in jail right. At least to be able to do that, and it makes her feel like she's sort of making up for the negligence, that she has done for him, you know Oh, and it will now she can like take care of me. and her really taking care of me as her just reaching in her wallet right my mom still doesn't know how to give love to she doesn't touch it doesn't say I love you she never says that should never. Right so that's why my mother what's i've always seen in the past, like anytime I was like doing really good or you know independent or whatever it was her time to like. Never praise never compliment never any of that shit because very, very deep down, in her subconscious I was. So individualized and separated from her, she couldn't show resentment because she had no reasons to and she couldn't take care of and because and that's her not being able to make up, but like Do you understand now like. You."
724.0,Provider,know I do.
13242.0,Patient,"Complete Lee like that in my life with her, so you know I decided to. You know, take the I called my psycho therapist the other day, the one who prescribes me my medication and. his whole thing when I got together with him was to take me off of my antidepressants and put me on mood stabilizers he was like are your antidepressants working I was like no does it seem like they are i'm paying this guy $500 an hour. Right that's why we talk for 10 minutes at a time now, but I got him on the phone for the other day, and I just told him and he was like wow page like. You do not sound like the person i've been talking to for the past two months, the person at the rehab like what is going on and. You know I just like after a while I told him everything that was going on and like wow you know she fucking blew up at me three weeks ago, like. I now in the type of person I understand now being vulnerable if somebody treats me a certain way when i'm being vulnerable and honest and I. Will will walk away from them and cut them out of my life and never looked back I don't give a Fuck what. But because i'm financially bound to this woman, I couldn't do that that day, and it was so I would have like i'm not kidding like I would have walked away, I would have left this House and I never would have talked to her again yeah."
724.0,Provider,Because you your guys's relationship is not built on a typical Hollywood dynamic of mother loves daughter. You know what I mean like.
13242.0,Patient,She should not either little.
724.0,Provider,"nope she shows her affection for you or parenting skills with money and it's a void of emotional value and that's what you need. So, in that sense it's easy for you, if you had financial stability, it would be super easy for you to disconnect from her because there is no emotional connection, other than she's in the power position, right now, power and control position, yet you and you get to be her punching bag. Now granted. She may be on the defensive all the time, just like you're on the defensive all the time, because all you guys know is how to fight you guys don't know how to communicate effectively and she may not be in a position. To hear that, and neither you just because you have so much strain in that relationship that relationship is fractured in such a way that it would take. A significant amount of time to repair anything that made even somewhat of a minor semblance of a healthy mother daughter relationship."
13242.0,Patient,"And you know it's not gonna it's not going to happen and I don't. Know it's definitely not going to happen and I don't have a problem with that i'm okay with that you know because I. The type of person that she is like the other day I you know I had a stomach ache because they ate something she's like don't eat that anymore, and I was like whatever i'm just that's who I am like. she's like well you know it's not you know, I was like. What I realized was in she basically said it was then fine if you're going to eat it, but I don't want to hear you complaining like don't ask me for help, and also, I asked her was for two cups of tea that was it. You know, and I thought to myself, like you know, a mom has this fat friend and I thinking like do you tell her like listen don't gain the weight back you know, and if you do like. don't you know don't eat any more taking your weight back you know if you do I don't want to hear you complain about the pain it causes your hips and your needs. So she could never say that to her friend."
724.0,Provider,"yeah she has time for people's aches and pains and athletics for everybody, but you you guys. You know what I mean, so we can circle back to you, you know this about her what you're trapped so like the only advice that I can give you is what like what did you how come you pulled away from your uncle."
13242.0,Patient,"And I just I was starting to get depressed and it was like a debbie downer you know any mean like I was just feeling. You know I went from going outside and like you know being outward and going around you know being outside of my room. To coming into the House to going into my room to shutting the door and not talking to anybody and just staying here and it's just like all depression shit. So anyway, this is my point of like what I was saying is that, like so I called psycho therapist and he asked me, you know after her blow up of what she did I mean I had an. You know I had a panic attack like I haven't had like in a long, long time like I really I felt like there was a hole like in my throat like that I couldn't get air could improve, and I was panicking was like I just felt like I was dying. And I don't I think that that was also part of the vulnerability of just like being so it's like living with your abuser like if i'm not being physically molested i'm being like mentally right."
724.0,Provider,Okay that's worse.
13242.0,Patient,"We yeah exactly and so. You know, and I told my husband, he said to me, he goes page like are you having flashbacks and I just lost my shit because I have been by ever since she did that i'm having flashbacks of like pieces of my life that I have like blacked out because they were that bad. And that she has been a direct part of and so he told me like it's imperative that you get out of that house. he's like I am not just worried about you relaxing i'm worried about like your life, like, I know how you are, I know what your history is and you need to get out of the House, so I went and I told her that that that's what he said and she said. that she would help me by. moving into like you know a little one bedroom or a little you know studio apartment. You know I just. You know I I just you know i'm the type of person I know where it's like I I start if these are all my often they start getting smaller smaller smaller and i've one thing left and then it's close. You know I mean last time I did that, I mean I felt that way I you know I really seriously tried to commit suicide like very, very seriously. And was angry when it didn't work very angry, it was like I can't even do that right. So I. am going to. And it's like where I live in Moran it's so fucking expensive, you know any mean um so. i'm gonna start looking around and see what I can find it just hopefully by the end of next week, I will be in a place, I don't have yeah I mean I don't have. You know, and I have to figure out a story or something to tell the renter because I don't have that I it's, not that I don't have good credit I just don't have credit. But yeah i'm yeah i'm getting out of here so that's."
724.0,Provider,"that's that's been the biggest thing, obviously, you know that I know that that that's the like a toxic environment to go to is going to zap you of all. Of all the gains that you've made, and especially if she's one of your primary if you had like a top 10 or top five. list of bullshit triggers that set you off on a downward path she would rank pretty high on that on that list so not you know. for you to go back there you know it it's setting yourself up for failure, but you had no other options so like like it is again a catch 22 which is like sometimes like I don't have like any kind of recommendation because it's like. Money is everything you know my is the the currency in the vocabulary of the world, so like when you don't have that and then you're beholden the people that just torture you. it's like What do you do like I don't want you sleep on the streets, I don't know if that's better you know what I mean like I don't want you out I had patients that were like tricking and stuff like I don't think that's better either so like. wow you know so it's like the lesser of two evils So when I say, like you, can't like get to you it's like. You need to go on like an autopilot as far as like almost like a robot in your interactions with her. Will you don't allow her to take any more of your energy away from you, like all the things that you've gained, you should still be able to maintain and if it's with her like just disconnect. Emotionally and personally with her and just hi how are you cool and then, when she starts getting I got stuff to do you don't want to be in like. not allowing her to impact you in a negative fashion, because you are seeking in some biological way you want something from your mom and you're not going to get that from her."
13242.0,Patient,and
724.0,Provider,"As soon as you realize that the sooner you'll be able to to to just separate the energy because she's just taking from you and you're allowing it because you're you're seeking that that affirmation for and you're just not going to get it so. But you need her you know so you're going to have to do some some using she's using you as her personal punching bag and a resentment from mistakes that that she's made in life, you need to use her. For the financial stability, stability and the House over your head for the time being. So, once you understand that she may not understand that you just play the part you're in California everybody's an actor there you know what I mean like you play the part long enough to get to a point where you don't need her anymore, and then you leave. and you're gonna like a like a real shitty relationship dynamic with her. But it's not worth her taking, like all the energy that you've that you've had it's like an emotional vampire like you don't have to invite them into your room. You know what I mean like like the old mythology with vampires you don't if you've liked them into the House and they'll take everything emotional vampires operate the same way, they only give you as much as you're willing to give them. So with that understanding, I would just OK, I can disconnect, but I still need you so i'll play the part and be like oh cool you're mad okay what's wrong like like I know you don't give a shit you know what I mean like. But she doesn't have to know that and, eventually, you get to a point where you're like all right peace out i'm out of here or not I mean. You know it's like heroin addicts, that they do really good and like. Controlled settings you know what I mean like I had tons of patients that like in person in residential programs, they were solid and the second, that they got out and somebody was like hey man. Maybe the first day they were cool with the second day got a little bit more difficult, and then by the third day for sure it's like if it's right there. it's like your main trigger yeah eventually you're going to cave you know, and she is that for you she's is like a negative cloud that hovers over you. know but you're stuck. So the alternative would be to fake the Funk, is what we would say to people fake it till you make it. ever say that in your dream Program. Now yeah you got to fake it until you make it with them. You know she's got power control model over you she knows you need the money so. Show us your as the punching bag. But she's willing to pay for an apartment for you. Are you what's what's the matter."
13242.0,Patient,what's the matter now we.
724.0,Provider,Go so so you're just like you're not talking back you're not engaged i'm just. blown away.
13242.0,Patient,My blown away.
724.0,Provider,"But I don't know, are you pulling away."
13242.0,Patient,"um. I don't know I don't i've never had a male therapist before, so this is all new to me okay."
724.0,Provider,um. You want to ask me something maybe that'll help.
13242.0,Patient,"yeah i've asked, I wanted to know a little bit about us so that I could understand who I mean listen any therapist that I go to I look at. I kind of look at it, as like an interview and I don't mean to use that title but it's. that's a good word, who is this person what you know just yeah like something I don't. i'm."
724.0,Provider,i'm an open book ask away.
13242.0,Patient,"Well, like the other day, you said something to me, to the effect of like you know I know what it is to you know, to go through something i've been through shit too so like. not asking you. You know personally but I whatever you're willing to divulge Jamie and. i'm not."
724.0,Provider,You know all right.
13242.0,Patient,Not a little kid I can do. Whatever you tell me.
724.0,Provider,"i'm sure um I mean i'll warn you, you don't get paid for my therapy sessions."
13242.0,Patient,Now I don't. But that's okay we're here.
724.0,Provider,um so I grew up in a highly abusive childhood i'm a latchkey kid. means like like your your parents would go to work and leave your home all day by yourself and I was like four or five so my brother and I were like latchkey kids.
13242.0,Patient,So it's like he older or younger.
724.0,Provider,Now he's a twin.
13242.0,Patient,identical yep identical.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, go ahead yep so we were latchkey kids and my mom was relatively young when she had us when I say young like a teenager. And she wasn't the best mom ever right, so there was a lot of physical abuse, there was not uncommon to get the shit kicked out of us for. Whatever reason in hindsight, as an adult now and it worked in this field, I understand, like why it happened, you know what I mean like you're asking like a lot, out of a teenager. You know what the expectations are when you're a kid is that this person is supposed to protect you and all this stuff and and truthfully they don't you know you know, nobody knows anything really so i've managed to move past that in my my elder age and i'm 39 years old now. So i've lived the life, so I get it, but I, you know I managed to forgive and not forget that stuff so it's made me who I am so I can't be too terribly upset with it, my father, on the other hand, he. He wouldn't really physically abuse us that was all my mom but he yelled and he was combative, and he would help us up you know what I mean throw frying pans all kinds of crazy shit I grew up in the city, it was crazy so."
13242.0,Patient,What did you do it.
724.0,Provider,"Now Providence Rhode island so. That was that that's an interesting childhood, you know for my brother and I like I didn't learn how to ride a bike till I was 11 because it would have gotten stolen I got more fistfights you know by that time. You know, even in high school and military time like I didn't do anything like that, even in my adulthood I fought less than I did when I was a little kid so that that that type of shit was on common. When I was 20 or when I was 18 or 19 September 11 happened and I joined the military. And went to war. So that was interesting and it was only then, when I was on the train ride to my basic training unit was when my dad Father like wrote a letter and said that he liked that he loved me and all that kind of stuff. And I remember reading it just being like I wish you would said this know years ago when I needed it I probably wouldn't be sitting on this train right now, but here I am on yep so I did that join the military how's it going."
13242.0,Patient,"enjoy when you join the military, was it like i'm like oh i'm in a fight for my country and that attitude, are we, like why why."
724.0,Provider,"yep some of it. You know, nationalistic i'm very proud to have been lucky enough to be born in this country because it's you know we're free to a lot of, to a large extent and we're not to, like others, you know. But my grandfather's you know, without my grandparents raising my brother and I during like that crucial time we probably would have ended up dead or you know worse, you know prison or whatever it is, so he was a war of a Korean War vet I idolized this man. And he used to tell a story is the good and the bad and I grew up being a latchkey kid on like you know 80s and 90s action movies, so I thought that's what life was so everybody My family has served in the military."
13242.0,Patient,So long we therefore.
724.0,Provider,For years. No.
13242.0,Patient,"Did you go back and forth, did you stay for years."
724.0,Provider,"Now I went overseas twice, no."
13242.0,Patient,way Desert Storm or what.
724.0,Provider,The recent one Iraqi. Freedom so.
13242.0,Patient,Was that did that give you trauma.
724.0,Provider,"Of course, you know, so I got I got a history of trauma, but I feel like I got a like a level of resiliency to because I grew up with it so like anything that I was exposed to overseas I was like. You know what I mean like it's another day you you learn a lot about yourself, when you relegate. The understanding that you're going to. Probably die. And once you accept that that you really start to live it's ironic right, so there was a TV show that I used to watch. It was based on a book called band of brothers is a really good World War Two mini series on HBO it's based on a book by Stephen Ambrose called band of brothers and one of the officers. And one of the army platoons he comes up on like a young private like a young kid and the kids panicking you know he's nervous he doesn't want to die. But this dude walk around he's like Christ on water and everybody like looks at me like this guy's insane. they're like I don't know how he's still alive and then he comes up to the kid and he's just like he's like what are you worried about kids like I don't want to die, and he was like you're already dead. it's like once you accept that he was like he's like all this just gets a lot easier."
13242.0,Patient,And it resonated with you.
724.0,Provider,"yep so like a lot of that stuff and you have to like really you really have to like come to grips and do you like like deep deep moral inventory and. All that kind of stuff so it changes you like that type of some changes, and now I have like a newfound like appreciation for life, because I seen so much I could go the other way."
13242.0,Patient,"So what happened after you went to the military, you were like what 2324."
724.0,Provider,yeah I got out when I was 24 and then I went to college and got a degree in psychology. worked full time when I was going to college. started working in corrections. To like like law enforcement stuff and then I got into case management and I got to the substance abuse counseling and then here I am.
13242.0,Patient,You just went from 24 to 39.
724.0,Provider,"yeah because because it took like 10 years you know what I mean like, and it was a strictly like from that time it was like go to college work school work relationships work. You know what I mean start developing and different you know clinical settings Inpatient outpatient."
13242.0,Patient,I work why don't you. Why don't you do like your own private practice.
724.0,Provider,You need a like a master's degree.
13242.0,Patient,Would you prefer to be doing that and what you're doing now. This is your dream job.
724.0,Provider,"No, I I think I already had my dream job."
13242.0,Patient,But that.
724.0,Provider,"The military was my dream job. It had structurally structure and organization, I met like like great people not I mean like like the places that i've been the people that I met and seen. Like I like I got the touch air force one like a garden air force one when President Bush came down for like like hurricane Katrina. Like I saw and did like amazing stuff i've got to travel the world and hang out with really cool people you know, there was no racism or. bigotry or anything like that you know, like all my friends are all multi national motion multicultural like you've learned a whole, but like it was a like a life. Life education and experience, you know that was like the greatest job and i've learned to like not allow my job to identify who I am because I make sense. yeah I do this because i've always managed, in some way I don't know why, but people look to me to give advice, mostly on like relationships. So, like my friends that were like breaking up with their girlfriends like I always seem to like give them enough insight and help them get through it. And it kind of just parlayed into doing counseling like I honestly don't know how how I ended up in substance abuse counseling just that I did. And I started working corrections and I saw that people from the other side because I was a cop in the military, so I got to see the other side, where it's like when people. get caught serve their time and then how they reintegrate into society, sometimes they're set up for failure. I saw that like for a sandwich like they can't get they can't get good jobs because they have felony records they can't get into good housing, because they have felony records so they're working to part time bullshit jobs and mcdonald's to make. money to live in section eight housing and it's like of course they're going to sell drugs and commit crime because they don't have any money so like I got to see, like all this stuff so. it's giving me like a lot of insight to like society i'm interested in politics i'm interested in like local government, all that kind of stuff. yeah I got kids now you know what I mean like my priorities are way different I got."
13242.0,Patient,kids do you have.
724.0,Provider,To boy girl but. One of each yep two and four. So.
13242.0,Patient,um Have you ever done drives and drinkers.
724.0,Provider,"course, of course, who hasn't. I don't know I know how I don't know anybody that's never done drugs or alcohol."
13242.0,Patient,"And, well, I mean you know what I mean like it was it just like. party and then you, you know you're out the door, did you get a little stuck on something."
724.0,Provider,"I think my I never had an issue with drugs or alcohol, because a lot of people want my family did, and I was aware of that. And so I think I had some resiliency on that side, I was always able to keep it on the tracks and never really push it my my drug of choice that left me injured permanently injured and financially strapped and all kinds of stuff was a martial arts."
13242.0,Patient,Go yeah.
724.0,Provider,"You know what I mean, so it was like that that was like my drug of choice, no, it was like the one thing that consumed my time my energy my financial resources and. Even when I was injured, despite knowing that despite the risk of being paralyzed and all kind of stuff I kept doing it, you know and that's like it's almost like the clinical definition of bad behavior and addiction, so that was my drug of choice. So yeah we you know when you're in the service like you can't do drugs right because they drug test you all the time, but what you can do is have access alcohol that's a huge thing in the military it's a huge thing. yeah so so yeah I have my phone."
13242.0,Patient,Do you feel like you're like a really you know deep person in terms of like your connection.
724.0,Provider,To work.
13242.0,Patient,I don't know you seem like you can very easily be detached.
724.0,Provider,"yeah I mean. it's like I said earlier, when you when you live a life of like like chaos you learn to spend your emotional currency like where it should be does that make sense."
13242.0,Patient,"So I mean i'm your mind will like, in your opinion, in your mind where should it be."
724.0,Provider,"I said, my my current CEO my kids and my girlfriend. At what I have leftover and it's a decent amount, I tried to give the people that are receptive, which is why I do this job like intrinsically I get something out of doing this because. You know, for, however, many people I see there are like breakthroughs that people have and i'm lucky that the see and be there with them. Like they get that self development, so I can never take credit for people's success, I don't want that that. This like seem like that's all i'm after because i'm definitely not because, if I hadn't take credit for all the success, I would have to take credit for all the failures to because it is a. it's a difficult profession to be in because not everybody makes it, you know what I mean like and you work really hard and. But you figure out where to put your currency like I meet patients here where it's just like yeah we're we're not going to have that kind of conversation like you and I have right now, you know what I mean it's very one sided in their life and their half in half out, you know. yeah so. Being able to detach though it's good for your you know it's good for your psychology because you only have so much money left, and I use it all the time that emotional currency it's like make sure you're spending it where or investing it where it needs to be."
13242.0,Patient,Again guess when I mean I mean do you feel like you're deeply insightful.
724.0,Provider,I don't know I don't know no I don't. know no I don't I don't think so no.
13242.0,Patient,You don't think you're a deeply insightful person.
724.0,Provider,"No, I don't really have like much of a like an ego you know what I mean like if there's like a conversation."
13242.0,Patient,A full is is having an ego to you I.
724.0,Provider,"I just don't have like like that, for, like myself, like if somebody said I was insightful i'd be like okay cool thanks like but I don't I don't think about it does that make sense. Like I don't. philosophy books and be like yeah I am really, really insightful I just I might have insight into certain subject matters and their stuff that i'm totally ignorant to like I just don't know like."
13242.0,Patient,"Well, I mean, I guess, I just, since this is your profession great, I guess, I mean like into psychology and the mind and behavior and. You oceans."
724.0,Provider,yeah I would say that I probably more on the pragmatic side of insightfulness like I lean more towards environmental psychology or evolutionary psychology.
13242.0,Patient,let's that.
724.0,Provider,"So it's like. Like we are like if you studied animals right you could train a dog to do a lot. And the very first dog. ever to interact with a human that was trainable was like a wolf but now we have like two hours and it's like if you took the DNA from ritual the DNA from a wolf they share the same DNA and you're like but they're not even close right. But over time and pressure. and change they develop into whatever we make it so humans are kind of the same way, like the reason why we are where we are is because we have opposable thumbs, which means that we're able to manipulate our environment or, like other animals can't. They can't like science really can't explain what the like the natural jump was to why all of a sudden, we developed like a consciousness. or former intelligence. But somewhere it did happen, you know I mean you can either chalk it up to religion or you could chalk it up to something else, but with the two. can agree on is that they like they don't know how we came to be here and, if you look around there's nothing else on the planet, like us, that thanks, like us, and acts like us, you see little things. You know what I mean like in like killer whales and dolphins, you see certain behaviors that aren't trainable but they they they're like natural they seem like there might be a little bit more to it like, if you take a cat and you stare at a cat. there's not a whole lot going on, like behind the eyes, you might think they are you know it'd be just like. Really they're just eating killing machine right you're just like Okay, but if you go to like seaworld and you like look at a dolphin or, if you look at like an orca like building or a better example, have you ever been to like a zoo that have like gorillas or apes or anything like that."
13242.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"yeah and like a lot of times you go like what are they doing like they're sitting with their back to you like there's things that you could watch and primates where you just like there's more. there's more going on. yeah there's some kind of connection there and we're we're not that far removed in the Grand scheme of things from primates. You know what I mean like we just happened to be where we are and we think we're we're smart as hell, but those things are on the evolutionary track are getting to that point to like they have. tribes that they studied down in Africa that are like in their stone age, which means that they're using stones to like start to manipulate their environments and they're. Using spears to catch fish and little things like that it's like they're catching up to us, I mean we still got thousands of years on it, but they're catching up you know what I mean so. The reason why we are what we are and why we experience the things that we do it's like natural fears and why are Why is everybody afraid of the dark, why are they afraid of loud noises, why are they afraid of falling like. You could take a baby and they've done these studies, where they take like two tables right they put a glass top on it."
13242.0,Patient,and
724.0,Provider,"The kiddo crawl to the edge of where he sees the two tables separated stops it's like that's that's not something that you taught the kid that's an in like an instinctual. trait that they have they don't want to fall, where does that come from well probably thousands of years ago. we're all living in trees, because we're pretty soft right like we're not tough we don't have metal clause or anything like that, if you fell, out of a tree. That probably meant certain death right, these were like prey animals predator come Jackie what is every horror movies start off like in the middle of night with fangs. You know, you could have never seen a horror movie before like cause my first one, and you watch it and there's like a monster that. kills people from the darkness and that resonates with you it's like, why does that happen it's like well it's probably way back in our DNA. You know what I mean we're hanging out and trees and jaguars and panthers jack those sharp teeth in the dark, you know what I mean like they're like little things like that are like leftover in our DNA and. If you pass on positive genetic traits you know, which is why, when we do these assessments and we asked you guys like what your family history is for like medical issues or psychological issues we're not just asking that because there's nothing to it means like if. My grandfather died of cancer and my grandmother died of cancer and then my mom had cancer, and then I had cancer and it's like. Well there's probably a link somewhere, you know you're at risk for that, so my dad was an alcoholic my mom was an alcoholic my brother's an alcoholic uh probably somewhere in my DNA i'm at risk for that. Right some of its environmental you know it's taught and and some of it is is predisposition you know, some people are sensitive to it or not. You know I can drink so much caffeine, and I never got a sugar high and ever get a caffeine, I like literally I will pound in my military hey they like. Red bulls and Jaeger Meister like 20 of them and, like a six hour window just and go home fall asleep. You know just not sensitive to it, where some people are just sensitive other things and it's not up to you, you know I mean like I as far as I want I can't get addicted to caffeine I can't drink monster energy drinks and and get energy for it and as much as I tried it doesn't work."
13242.0,Patient,"So do you think that, like in your. Within like your education, I mean this is your industry can you see like in certain people's behaviors are you able to say, like they probably went through this like they have the behavior of somebody that you know what I mean, like you, you learn that in school or like."
724.0,Provider,"You would you would learn that more and in person, so psychology is the study of the mind the human mind and behavior. And study being like the key word because there's no empirical evidence will like. Why we do what we do, but you do pick up on like through experience like like certain behavioral traits where you're like okay well they're probably. they're probably not going to listen to what you're going to say and they're probably gonna do what they want to do anyways until they hit a certain point, and then in hindsight, they grow from it, so is that what you mean."
13242.0,Patient,"I just mean in the way of like you know I. I see somebody sort of behaving in a certain way or. I don't know even like myself yeah I see a lot of psychology and all i'll see somebody within their behavior and I can ask them like. You know Is this something that you have been through where you, you know traumatized as a child by your father or your mother or whatever the classic tree is. um you know, nine out of 10 will say yes that's what I mean in terms of what i'm asking you like, do you do you learned like are you able to take some of the things that you learn at school, like tools skills ways of going about you know getting information or whatever like."
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah, of course, so, so what happens sometimes it's like when you're in class and most people get into like like their their career field. Because there's some kind of pull natural pool to it like, if you want to be a mechanic and probably means that you're probably good like tinkering with stuff when you're a kid so it's kind of like a learned behavior right. And then, when somebody explains it to in a way that you thought you understood it, but then they put it, a title with it then you're like okay that's what that is does that make sense. yeah yeah so that that's kind of what it is so like when you're in school and college is just like high school, you know what I mean like they throw everything at you. And then, whatever sticks is probably what you're more receptive to, which is why they teach you like. everybody gets the same curriculum, the same math the same English, but not everybody goes up to be a mathematician or an English major they kind of separate based on their strengths and their weaknesses. And psychology is the same way, so like when I was inside I took like 20 classes right, so the first few years of college. I took one site course in general site so it's like a real broad thing and then your last two years or last my last few years is like now, you get to take 20. standardized or individualize site courses and really that's the see what sticks and then, if you went out to your masters, it would probably be like one or two. Things that stuck in most and that's where you end up being right and the things for me that stuck was like like cognitive psychology so like the way that we think, and I struggled in that class but i've learned, like the most I took. abnormal a hoagie."
13242.0,Patient,Like cvt type stuff.
724.0,Provider,"That that's. yeah that. that's a that's a therapy model right so it's just like cognitive therapy behavior so it's like the thought process. Whatever you think and then how you respond as your behavior and then the treatment would be like. Okay, so now that's the behavior let's find alternative practices so, then you can retrain your brain so when you have that thought again you do this new learned behavior and then that becomes the standard. So it's like a like a conditioning, you know I mean the slide was more about like the way that the brain processes information. retains it, how you recall it, you know short term memory long term memory all that stuff to me was interesting. How I would apply it today, you know you probably have to be like a neuropsychologist word. But I learned a lot just generally like I learned a lot, I thought it was a cool class the abnormal psych courses that I took and I took like a woman's mental health psych course. They were they were almost identical because women suffer from mental health conditions more than males do."
13242.0,Patient,Why do you think they really.
724.0,Provider,"yeah, why do you think that is this goes back to the evolutionary psychology."
13242.0,Patient,I mean what you know I I one thing I definitely observed in rehab i've been to the one when I was sober 15 years 16 years ago was there's a lot more men than women in rehabs it's.
724.0,Provider,For for drugs low or for mental health.
13242.0,Patient,"Because there's like a fine more well, I mean I you know, obviously, for drugs there that's the first diagnosis obviously there's always something mental connected to using drugs, we don't get you know we're not trying to check out emotionally, because we feel dandy and grand. Right right so. yeah they're all dual diagnosis so. But still there's still like it's still like a, so why do we think, women are more I just think that women are more emotional they."
724.0,Provider,Right. But why are they more emotional.
13242.0,Patient,And they have fucking hormones.
724.0,Provider,Go. There you go.
13242.0,Patient,"I hope that shit that's The one thing I hate about being a woman, the whole hormones, and you know babies and crying and."
724.0,Provider,i'm sympathetic to.
13242.0,Patient,I hate all that ship.
724.0,Provider,"To the women's plight, but they haven't definitely have it harder than men in that department now. Now so think of this right, and I use this as an example, just like this one observation. On an 11 year old girl is probably pretty manageable, you know what I mean like there's nothing. unique or significant that you're probably on the lookout for the prize like a normal kid right and then what happens. They get the first period and now their chemical balances all screwed up, so what you get is the week leading up to administration your hormones are like this and then you get your period and then you're. you're devastated your iron deficient you're just emotionally rag that you're just a mess and the following week is like your recovery week."
13242.0,Patient,"Right, mostly rag doubt is felt. Like people say i'm on the rag."
724.0,Provider,"could be so. Okay, so the following week is like the recovery week right. you're right your chemicals are finally getting back finally getting back and then, what do you got you got about a week. or less. To kind of be cool and then you're right back into that cycle, where it's like the week prior like Oh, I can feel it coming on and your mood shifts and you get to the period and. So that happens right altered teenagers, on top of your cognitive development. Your you know your brain is developing you're inundated with do environmental things to stress anxiety, like all this stuff has happened to you during that timeframe. You introduce chemicals that probably aren't naturally your body caffeine nicotine alcohol we cocaine and heroin, you know, like all this stuff is happening right and you're still managing your natural hormonal cycle. And then you hang out with a bunch of girls you joined the cheerleading squad and guess what now your. cycles are all screwed up for a while, because then they set up and then somebody leaves and somebody else comes in and your cycle get screwed up, so this goes on and on and on stress and college and bullshit bullshit bullshit. Now you're in your 20s and you have a kid and then what happens. Those hormones, stop the other ones come in and then for nine months you're carrying around this life your oxytocin levels are through the roof you're you're kind of a master. Your pre part of your all these things, and you have the kid, which is a life changing event. it's all these things, and then you have postpartum withdrawal postpartum depression it's not like, I want to drown my kid but your balances all out of whack again crazy crazy and then for months it's certain light backup and then guess what up."
13242.0,Patient,"Now, your periods Okay, so I get it roller coaster."
724.0,Provider,"Right and then metaphors happens so just as soon as you guys figure it out menopause happens and then you're out of the you know you're out of the cycle again so. yeah, you would think would all those deviations and exceptions like they almost certainly more prone to have mental health concerns because all it takes is one thing to go bad too much serotonin and not enough to open mean your."
13242.0,Patient,Your Angela do men have like what.
724.0,Provider,know when it comes to that.
13242.0,Patient,Blue balls.
724.0,Provider,"Sorry Sorry, I guess, maybe as as bad as it gets for them, it seems."
13242.0,Patient,Like you.
724.0,Provider,"know in the chemical department, it probably is you know for the broad spectrum of men that don't have mental health issues on either side yeah they don't have to worry about that we have to worry about. Johnson has killed, you know what I mean men take high risk jobs, and you know that kind of stuff there there's more men died violently. In the world and women, do you know what I mean so there's like a risk association would be in a male from mortality, but. So that's that's kind of the payoff the yin and the Yang would be like you know emotional mental instability versus physical instability. So, but those are all leftover evolutionary trades, and I mean like. that's why we are what we are the pressures isn't something that I invented anxiety isn't something that you invented like it just it's been. Common in in our species for a long time, some people haven't way more some people don't have it at all when they should like being anxious is a natural reaction, you know. You know, to test taking to entering things that you don't know the outcome anxiety is a very natural thing it's actually a safety mechanism that keeps you alive, because if you're just like oh i'm just gonna walk up to this cliff and then. fall offering like Oh, actually, let me look like you should be anxious in certain like certain respects and then obviously you know the people that were it's debilitating because they can't get out of bed like that's a problem it's a chemical imbalance. Depression that's that's are."
13242.0,Patient,You have you ever had depression. Or do you just get like oh i've been depressed before but not like.
724.0,Provider,"Now, of course, growing up like my childhood growing up like you know it's like there's a real hard time real horse on."
13242.0,Patient,That as an adult not so much.
724.0,Provider,"No, I mean as a dog I have just as much as anybody else you know I worry about my family I got other stuff going on personally and it's like yeah I mean."
13242.0,Patient,"Like I show them the way that you come off I guess you could say, is the only term I can use right now is is you seem pretty resilient."
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah yeah like you have to be like that's that's the right thing is because i've seen people I use military a lot I think in this country if there was some form of civil service, not everybody needs to like be in the infantry or go to war but. The structure that that thing gave me and a lot of people that that's been in it the ability to connect with people from all different walks of life country bumpkins to city people to. You know, like like one of my best friends was from California, is a Mexican dude from California like just the exposure that you get to all these other people and then being forced into a small tribal setting which we thrive in you know. And then forced to perform tasks that you mentally think that you're incapable of doing until you actually doing them and you're like holy shit i'm doing all these things that that I don't think I could do it's very empowering your confidence level is like through the roof. You know I used to like. Like I was skinny kid and you know, by the time I got into the military, by the time I left, I was like whatever like whatever throw whatever you want at me like an hour and i'll do it whatever tasks like i'm not scared of shit like what can you do you know what I mean so."
13242.0,Patient,What are you scared of. The site your kids.
724.0,Provider,testing.
13242.0,Patient,"that's pretty much it you scared of, though."
724.0,Provider,"I mean, I have like an irrational fear of sharks and I don't go into the ocean, because I can't like I didn't learn how to swim until I was like 31."
13242.0,Patient,Oh wow so.
724.0,Provider,I have like an irrational fear of drowning.
13242.0,Patient,So that's your. that's your that's what you fear in life is not. You know this or that or whatever is sharks.
724.0,Provider,"Yes, women like drowning swimming in the ocean get attacked by a shark it's an irrational fear, I have some rational fear because i'm not i'm not a good swimmer so. Having a fear of drowning in the ocean is reasonable, because i'm not a strong swimmer so like I don't take that risk, but the rational part of that fear is like sharks like I couldn't imagine not being able to see the bottom of the ocean, so I like dark ocean terrifies me."
13242.0,Patient,"You know I live in your in your industry. You, this is what you I know your dream job was the military but let's put that aside is this your dream job. This is what would be your preference. So then, what."
724.0,Provider,yeah I don't know like I don't know what I.
13242.0,Patient,don't know.
724.0,Provider,"Because I don't think I think most people that work they don't really have a choice of like what their dream job is like like you. know. Like everyone's dream job my dream job if I could get paid to do anything yeah let me play video games, but I get."
13242.0,Patient,"It I mean like in your industry, as I just said, like in your industry and this industry that you're in right now. Is this right here, where you want to be, this is perfect, this is this is great."
724.0,Provider,"I would prefer, if I have the choice to work with veterans. Right. Right, but I get to work with veterans occasionally because of this job. I got a handful of people on my caseload better veterans and i'm like oh shit you know what I mean like and that that that that gives me some motivation, because I like there's like a mutual thing that we can really share like shared experiences like that. So yeah like like i'm in the business of helping people i've been in public service my whole life so if it wasn't this, it would be some other form of public service. And that's what i've been trying to naturally I cherish it don't do it for the money like social services, does it bay. You know so i'm not that smart to where i'm like oh yeah I should be making millions of dollars like like I don't do this for the money I get and I don't work till midnight 1230 most nights with this job because I do it for the money. So there are times, where I can connect with people and give them some some some information, you know, based on my experiences and experiences that i've obtained through other people's experiences and then maybe help people become more productive in their life, no."
13242.0,Patient,Have you seen like. You help people have you seen the help you've given people and that the effect that it has on them.
724.0,Provider,"yeah now get some summary of my when I was a real big idealist when I was younger and the field and shit and I wanted to save everybody. yeah I got patients that i'm still in contact with to this day, that have been gone on pull themselves out of whatever right They ran and. managed to like live a productive. Life get married have kids you know what I mean like. Like everybody is salvageable you know what I mean like that's why we are, we are again at the top of the food chain, because we were very, very resilient We just have to get out of our way and if it takes. Two months to do that or two years or 20 like eventually you will figure it out, people do figure out the answer and that's where they'll start to invest their energy. People that want to be helped, ask for help and that's when they're ready. If there's still resistance and fear, all that stuff some of that's something that's natural but you're gonna you're going to embrace some of that chaos, to know, because it can't always be like this it's not always chaotic. So that's my that's my perspective."
13242.0,Patient,"All right, well, I conclude this interview."
724.0,Provider,"I didn't get an answer any questions, I mean I had thyroid cancer to you know something like a cancer survivor so."
13242.0,Patient,It answering my question. yeah I said tell me about yourself and you did. yeah I appreciate that.
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and I believe me, page like I want you to I want you to get out of that trap that you're in because I think you, you are insightful you're probably more insightful than I am. And you have a story to tell, and there are people out there that want to listen and would love to engage with you. But your current. peer group sucks and you're stuck and there is no immediate fix to that it's it's going to take a little bit time but you can't you can't check out on that. You know me and you can't let them dissuade your effort, because that's what they're going to do they want to sidetrack you know, and I want to knock you off your fucking horse, but just don't let them. sounds cliche but it's like you, are the master of your own domain."
13242.0,Patient,"No cliches. All right, I get enough I grew up with the cliche of go with the flow yeah like I don't think you know four year old child should do that when your mother is. Right, you know dealing drugs and being you know promiscuous and is a bunch of creepy people around you know move you 50 times in your life so yeah. i'm not i'm not into the cliches this she's. she's the cliche queen Anyway, thank you for talking to me, I appreciate it."
724.0,Provider,"All right, i'll see you what tomorrow."
13242.0,Patient,yep tomorrow. Six o'clock right.
724.0,Provider,yep yep six o'clock your time alright.
13242.0,Patient,"Alright, thanks, Joe how are."
724.0,Provider,You today good.
13242.0,Patient,Come on let's see. where's the thing boop.
