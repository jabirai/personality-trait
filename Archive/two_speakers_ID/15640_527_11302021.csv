ID,Role,Message
527.0,Provider,"hi this is Andrea, this is an individual session for Scott Claire. hey Scott, how are ya."
15640.0,Patient,yourself.
527.0,Provider,i'm doing okay thanks. Nice yeah well how things been the last couple weeks.
15640.0,Patient,"Fine ish I think. The best way to describe it, you know, I think. they're kind of, on balance, fine you know, again, I understand that's not how these things work, but like I kind of feel like i've. come to grips with my sister and her passing and her death and like you know i'm not. Thinking about it all the time i'm not kind of like questioning things and just sort of like okay I got the information that I needed to get and I can move forward, and you know it's just not you know that. You know not not an area of focus for me right now my job, stressing me out as a super big area focus and then, and you know this week i've been doing PR rhonda has guidance, I have been logging my food. And then really funny to watch that process. You know lots of not surprising insights and lots of surprising moments of just like oh man, this is, been a fun experiment and i'm going to go back to not eating so i'll see everybody later."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
15640.0,Patient,So so yeah.
527.0,Provider,"Okay, so where where have things landed with. With your sisters passing and everything I know the last time you would you'd gotten some information and they were you know. yeah any any additional information or any other anything else, since then."
15640.0,Patient,No nothing since then so there's still no plans for any kind of Memorial or anything and. They may be something later and. she's being cremated and I have no idea what's going to happen to her ashes and that's it it's all. About.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15640.0,Patient,So yeah.
527.0,Provider,"how's how's the rest of the family doing, are they leaning on you at all or everybody able to. fans."
15640.0,Patient,"process, you know it's interesting to my sister Julie and I are super close and so we spent a lot of time talking about it right and we do. You know, for me the part of the processes, and you know, of course, we did a road trip for thanksgiving down the stairs moms and on the way back there and I were in the car and we're listening to. This comedian and he was doing his bit on eulogies right and he was. Okay, why are you would you though so like hyper positive and he did a much better job than I well, but he was like not everybody's great. You know, could you imagine you know, like his joke, was it like for like a serial killer he's like well when he wasn't killing people like he also had to pass. It was really funny and it just sort of illuminated. me how important it was to come to terms with like the positive memories, I had a Stacy and also the very negative memories, I had of Stacy and not to like overly. shine or Polish either side of the coin right like the US, you know she was funny she was very smart she was a part of my life. You know, Sarah talks very fondly about me being her and, like the connection the two of them had and also she was like hyper vicious and super manipulative and just you know kind of mean to her bones. And both of those things are true."
527.0,Provider,yeah and I was gonna say what's it like being able to hold both of those because they are very incongruent with each other.
15640.0,Patient,"yeah and it's that it's just that, like accepting Stacy for who she was part of the process, you know and just remembering that so yeah it's easy for me to hold those two things because there's so much evidence on both sides."
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm yeah yeah cuz that's definitely challenging for a lot of people is to be able to say you know i've got this positive feeling but i've also got this negative feeling and it doesn't feel good it doesn't. Sometimes doesn't feel right but they're both true and so. Being able to say it's it's kind of like radical acceptance and so you know that it is, it is what it is like they're both true and and and I can be okay with that as well yeah."
15640.0,Patient,"And so Julie and I are fine, and you know I wouldn't say that she's leaning on me, any more than i'm leaning on her, you know that feels really equal and balanced. My mom. is definitely like you know i'm going to be mean but she's been you know morning at more higher touch. You know, etc, etc, and. You know I think i've emotionally signed up for just sort of helping being a little here more available. Because it's the holidays, and you know it's not you know she's not including our thanksgiving implants she's not included in our Christmas plans, but we can find a couple Saturdays to see her so it's two holidays in her birthday and her daughter died right like I get that. i'm not okay i'm not totally blind. is probably you know it is much harder for her and she hadn't spoken to Stacey seriously since like 96 you know they saw each other briefly at my dad's you know 16 years ago. But not one word sense and so now my mom, on the other hand, is just like sending me these just awful text messages of like spewing this hyperbolic oh my God Stacy was so great and it's in this line better have it like I get it it's all the things that she has to do to deal with. Processing on her end but it's like it's not mine."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
15640.0,Patient,"yeah so and so she didn't answer your question she's leaning on me a little bit more. But nothing, nothing crazy, you know it hasn't got it hasn't gotten past it a comfort zone or any kind of a trigger boundary that I would have."
527.0,Provider,Okay okay yeah so how How did the holiday go thanksgiving that one's always can be a tricky one for people.
15640.0,Patient,It was totally fine you know it was it was really interesting because my sister Julie decided kind of at the last minute to come with us. She doesn't have the full week of work off and they obviously she's a she works at a counselor at a high school and they frown on people taking time off sick days basically in front of a holiday like she's like I can actually use my bereavement day.
527.0,Provider,yeah.
15640.0,Patient,"They can't question it at all, and so being available so she came down, which was nice it was nice to have time with her. And then there's. brother came and it was you know all the family dynamics that you would expect, Sarah. Was I think it was in one of the intuitive eating podcast she was listening to someone was giving some advice around dealing with the holidays and one of them, which was the one that stuck with both of us was. This this holiday be unsurprised. And I thought that was really clever right like people get together and act. Actually, like they always backed off every time throughout the year, and yet somehow there's sort of like an exaggerated response to that. And i've been super guilty of that myself and those just been like oh right that's how my sister acts and that's how it says mom X and that's how I act right and that's how."
527.0,Provider,You know everyone and yeah.
15640.0,Patient,"It was just a little bit like that relieves a little bit of the stress and pressure and we ended up leaving a day early we weren't sleeping well. It had like six nights five nights of interrupted sleep due to diabetes, you know, Sam had some like crazy scary lows yeah. Okay, if i'm if I mentioned diabetes stuff that doesn't make sense to you i'm happy to talk about it and kind of get context, if that's helpful I just tend to talk about it and. sure not really so I always available to get more you know, and he had some highs and so we're. doing a little bit of like middle of the night. Maintenance around diabetes and, like all the normal stuff that happens, like when night his site just fell out and so that means he's not getting insulin while he sleeps and so his blood glucose got super high, which is scary. You know, Sarah caught up with him and corrected it, but it was like lots of nights of interrupted sleeping and then just we'd sort of figured out the sleeping arrangements in sarah's mom her brother showed up with their two kids and it was just like a night of screaming children. And people were anyway and we're just like leave a day early and it just it didn't that perfect thing of leaving everyone wanting just a little bit more, which is kind of the ideal state to leave in so we got two nights to sleep in our own beds and recover from the holiday, we had an. Add stuff to do around the House which was super helpful. yeah it ended up being fine and you know, of course, like. So yeah there were no like big fights or any issues is very interesting and I don't know if this is like good therapy father or not, but happy to talk about it, you know sarah's mom is 75 she's like the same age as my mom. And I love her she's wonderful great person like just like all thumbs up. share, and she drinks and, as always, drink and like I remember the first night I met sarah's parents like we put down like man, it was a lot, like, I want to say I drank like one to two bottles of wine that night like I was hammered. Okay, and so like they've just that's always just been a part of like her life, and she enjoys wine. And now she's retired. it's you know it's just it's interesting for me to watch her, and also for Sarah experiences like. You know she starts shrinking and you kind of lose her right she gets strong. She often will be much she. repeats herself a lot she says things and just like her, as like the person Jane kind of disappears, a little bit. And we saw that exaggerated a little bit over the holidays, where it's."
527.0,Provider,Just like.
15640.0,Patient,"You know the ability to kind of engage with her and like I don't think it's at a point where like Sarah would bring it up to her, but it's certainly something that like you know we everybody notices."
527.0,Provider,You know hey yeah.
15640.0,Patient,it's really it's really interesting so it's weird for me to sort of like monitor that and I always get self conscious about like you know because i've liked the fucking teetotaller like over to I don't want to sit there and sort of be perceived as this like high and mighty well i'm.
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
15640.0,Patient,"And so I just kind of like observe and watch it and so that was one key one was like man sucks because we just lose her like we lose her before dinner. And like we can't even have a cool. dinner conversation, you know because it's just a little. Sarah can hear me now which we talked about this very openly. It was very sad and then the other thing was like on the last day we were there Julie and I were sitting on the deck by ourselves and we're like it's weird that no one has asked us about Stacey like sarah's mom didn't bring it up. bring it up, and it was just like I don't care like if people don't want to talk about it, they don't have to i'm not going to force the issue."
527.0,Provider,It was a funny moment where you're like oh.
15640.0,Patient,gosh sister just died and like these people who whom we've known for.
527.0,Provider,A long time.
15640.0,Patient,"didn't even give the like hey i'm sorry or hey condolences or. yeah how are you doing. Those just sort of like. And I don't know what to do with that information, and I think you know there's like she has a real strong point of view about how Americans do really poorly with that, and you know I certainly see that as well, so i'm not going to graduate them. Like i'm not like you know, keeping score on that, but it was just an interesting observation that sure yeah definitely."
527.0,Provider,"yeah I mean it's that's a great point that you bring about like, how do you deal with death and loss and grief and it seems like it's something people want to tiptoe around I. Think, and not just. be direct with it and I I don't know what that's about either Scott, you know, is it because it's uncomfortable you know it's an uncomfortable feeling and so. You know, or you don't know what what to say exactly, but sometimes saying nothing is just as bad as saying something you know saying something that. That you're not quite sure what to say you know, and maybe it's even just saying you know I don't know what to say right now but i'm just sorry to hear about your sister like even just to acknowledge that, like to make note of it yeah is is. yeah very interesting dynamic, especially with with the family yeah like that you've known."
15640.0,Patient,"me. And i'm not being flippant nor light like it didn't bother me, you know it's not like something that I was like Oh well, that sucked and i'm super heard about it and I need to go back and like confront them, it was just like oh yeah that didn't happen weird."
527.0,Provider,"move on. yeah well and I think probably part of that is you've been in you know processing it now for a couple weeks or so and and working through those different emotions, so it wasn't as raw I mean it's still there, but you also had a distant relationship with your sister too so. You know the. yeah the dynamics were you know not not as close as it maybe that's maybe that's what they were thinking I don't know i'm just kind of reading minds, maybe they knew, you know you didn't have a super close relationship with your sister and so. Maybe it's you know not something to acknowledge acknowledge I don't know but yeah."
15640.0,Patient,"yeah yeah, so I think that was the summary, then the other thing is just like the food stuff you know it was just like. You know i've been making my log and you know going through the process of it and there was a day that's like Wednesday we're saying man I got this like i'm gonna I feel like i'm gaining weight, I feel gross about any way I don't like. That that's happening and I don't know that I see you know I don't I can't see the end state clearly. So I just have that like panicky like."
527.0,Provider,"Oh, my God."
15640.0,Patient,I think I should and My instinct was to restrict my instinct was to just stop eating. Okay.
527.0,Provider,And then.
15640.0,Patient,Oh go ahead.
527.0,Provider,"Oh, so when you do."
15640.0,Patient,"might have been a couple of meals, that I skipped. And you know but what's funny is like on thanksgiving I didn't actually for any of the thanksgiving in recent history, like, I am one plate of food and and he's buying some ice cream and like felt fine you know I didn't feel stuck or disgusting or gross. And didn't feel like I over a earlier in the day, just sort of felt like a pretty normal day. Okay, eating, which I was like oh that's kind of cool i'm like I get it like I can see how this would be like a really healthy way to live, where you just sort of eat and don't make a big deal of it."
527.0,Provider,But yes.
15640.0,Patient,"But extrapolating that one day. was really hard for me and then the other thing is, you know and i'm such a hot mess in my brain about all this stuff that it's like I can't hold on to a thought along like. It what struck me is like I was like Okay, I want to restrict like restricted, what I want to do, and then at the end of the day, I would binge and they were like oh yeah benjamin's what I want to do, and there were a lot of days, where on the charting. My I forget the way it's phrased but, like my my desire to restrict was very high and my desire to binge was very high simultaneously and I wasn't aware of that happening at the same, but like I just in my own head hadn't thought of that."
527.0,Provider,concern.
15640.0,Patient,"You things that happened at the same time. But it was like oh yeah right, I want to stop eating, but then I also want to just overeat really quickly. So. yeah."
527.0,Provider,"yeah, and so what what's been like the pattern of holidays in the past as as opposed to this, this one."
15640.0,Patient,"yeah and just think I wouldn't just completely overeat like at every. You know, on a holiday it's like the total. You know I have, like many people that logic of just like Oh well, thanksgiving the new year's I guess we'll just destroy everything versus the like oh there's also three special meals that happened in six weeks like. Special meal, instead of torpedo even. You know any of your efforts. That that. connect to kind of higher aspirations or goals so. So yeah like yeah it would just be overeating and and and and perpetuating an extension of that like Oh well, that was thanksgiving but then that after there's this thing and then. You know, on Tuesday I better just have this because now we're doing that, and then it just kind of snowballs into like. Okay, and have five weeks of over over eating for sure. yeah and there's been times like when i've been. So funny because I always want to use the phrase when i've been better about my diet. yeah when i've been hyper restrictive. There have been times, where I can get through it, you know where I can white knuckle and be like oh there's all this food and candy and I can get by without it, and I can compensate by drinking coffee or I can compensate by. You know just white knuckling or whatever the. Coping technique is. So yeah."
527.0,Provider,yeah what kind of feelings are starting to come up with with the food.
15640.0,Patient,"um it's interesting you know, the biggest ones, and in the the ones that they listed to choose from anxious is a big one. I would. translate that a little bit into like stress just like low grade stress. is really common and I find that. I find that one more correlated to restriction, you know I just like today, or it was yesterday. I wasn't even thinking I just didn't eat and it wasn't like conscious it wasn't like oh i'm going to restrict today or oh. This is like. now's my window to restrict I was just like my stomach and body just felt so anxious and I was like i'm not gonna eat it. I literally did okay even afford myself the space to think not to eat I just like looked up, and it was one o'clock and I was like oh shit my reminders on the phone off, I totally didn't see them. I totally did me and then it like for after my meetings that down, I went into the kitchen like told me eight four pieces of pizza and then you know it was just like well. So stress is a big emotion that comes up. Shame is a big one that comes up and just confusion, you know it's just an area that just stirs so much like so many different voices in my head like five or six voices, you know saying. You know. saying things like both. suffering is a part of it, I think that's a common mantra that I have that I use in lots of different areas of my life like, if you want something great you need to work exceptionally hard and suffer for it like suffering is certainly a component of success in my worldview. Okay, and I don't know why. But yeah but that feels connected to weight loss it feels connected to. professional success it feels connected to. You know, to working out as much as I can delineate or distinguish between working out and weight loss. yeah but, like you know those mantras of like do hard things, and you know fight through the pain and you know. Those sort of myths that have been ingrained in my brain for 45 years from culture okay definitely live they're still you know they definitely are in my head and I hear them a lot."
527.0,Provider,And then.
15640.0,Patient,"You know it's just like oh carbs are bad sugars bad he you know he permissive Lee what you want. yada yada yada have some candy it's not going to kill you like Okay, you know it's just like all these like different things like Oh well, you should eat you know healthy, vegetables and let us and you know steamed chicken or you should eat you know cheese and bacon. You know yeah. And I just inside say with like the stress and anxiety and. In other emotions that confusion just sits there front and Center."
527.0,Provider,Okay what's the confusion about.
15640.0,Patient,What to do.
527.0,Provider,Okay.
15640.0,Patient,"And even like I was like oh even like. If we get doing doing immediate and I let's say I achieve some place where i'm very comfortable like listening to cues and my body even according to what my body needs like. What, then, like what like like isn't there also like a method that is like you should eat this kind of food because it's better for you or like. That this is better fuel for your body like where does that come in, in three years right like I just and I don't know what that answer is like. I think it's better to eat salad and chicken or salad and you know something, but I don't know like what if, in three years that's not what my body wants and i'm just like 500 pounds and fuse to a couch somewhere, which is my biggest fear. Okay."
527.0,Provider,Because.
15640.0,Patient,"Because it just signifies like. It signifies totally giving up like that's like I I translate my struggles with weight loss in to failure, obviously, for me, and the extrapolation of that failure into the absurd is like a total quitting you know that passive suicide of just over eating beyond any reasonable. You know notion."
527.0,Provider,yeah and any thought of i've i've turned into my parents.
15640.0,Patient,"Sure yeah for sure there's that chunk. You know it's that's always the sort of juggling that ball, of making sure that it's not that the the circles never overlap in any kind of a better way."
527.0,Provider,"Okay yeah yeah. So let's So then, where does the shame come in."
15640.0,Patient,"The shame just comes in, with you know not looking conventional right and it's just not it comes into like not being able to buy clothes at a normal store it comes in, and like falling outside of like traditional sizes. And things like that and, just like you know I I translate a lot of that into just like self hate and disgust and shane."
527.0,Provider,"yeah so when did that start, do you think those mantras those. You know self hate the discussed this."
15640.0,Patient,"Many years ago, as I can remember man memories in elementary school feeling that way certainly high school, but like younger."
527.0,Provider,yeah what comments were made to you at that age.
15640.0,Patient,"You know, some basic comments around you know just being like fat or being teased for being fat, but to me it's like less about. comments made you know we've talked about this like looks that I that people would give me sort of whispering and like shock it seeing my family walk in anywhere movie theater a restaurant whatever. Those were pretty damaging those those have stuck with me a lot, and you know it's just sort of that like. You know sort of like freakish nature hush hush and then I would say that you know a lot of it is just societal you know internalization you know i've just taken it and just grabbed a hold of it and said cool, this is the worldview unchallenged and. You know i'm just going to adopt this is, is what is conventional thinking and and I did you know tremendously successful at just paid myself for not looking. Like my peers, like my friends super confused like watching my friends eat whatever they wanted, and I would eat like an eighth of it and still gain you know and still sort of sitting in like a morbidly obese phase and that's you know, obviously isolated, but like. Sure in in general, and you know it's hard to go back and try and analyze like you know how much benji and happen, how much overeating happen, you know in my childhood, but like. Just in a general way I would kind of look at how other people, I mean like like either we're eating the same or i'm eating less and gaining more weight. i've kind of held that. sort of basic thesis in my head for a while, unable to really validate or or confirm it yeah yeah."
527.0,Provider,"What was what was your initial like if you can think back to like when you remember, recognizing just where mom and dad where's forest with food or way body image like woody, what do you remember, thinking about that."
15640.0,Patient,"Man, I want to say for ever, but that can't be right, you know, but I wanted you know. you're like even as early as like you know my memories are kind of shit you know, I was born in Lake tahoe. For six months, and then we moved to Idaho and I live there for seven years and I have just like Barry few memories like handful like maybe 10. memories and it was funny Julie was my sister was talking about this, we can just like you remember that we left I don't know because. Our parents filed for bankruptcy, they were having the House foreclosed on them like that's why we left, and I was like I had no idea, no idea about that. You know, seven like."
527.0,Provider,Sure yeah.
15640.0,Patient,"yeah I wasn't performing audit yet yeah. And so that was like an interesting data point to pick up. And then, so a lot of my memory start. We don't want to we move to the bay area in 1984 and I was eight seven or eight and. And you have to say, every memory, I have at that point my parents were obese."
527.0,Provider,"What do you remember them saying about food or weight, like any messages or talk that they had or."
15640.0,Patient,"I think they had very conventional talk tracks like Oh, we should all die, we should be losing way like we shouldn't look like this, you know, I think that was definitely a. commonly held premise, you know my dad was particularly hard on my oldest sister Stacy who was you know I would say morbidly obese and 14. And that sucked obviously and then she would react, and that would suck. You know, and it was just like yeah I mean at that point yeah that would have been right when I was a I mean she was probably she started high school and we moved to San Jose and I was in the second grade. or seven years apart. So yeah my memory of her as always have been overweight. And they're being tension around that. You know and it's so super easy to see in hindsight and with adult is like you know my dad fucking hated himself, he totally rejected all of this shit you know under her. You know, and she, of course, reacted and but, like you know my dad was the adult like that's his fucking job like he needs. To be able to do that."
527.0,Provider,So what was his comments about mom then.
15640.0,Patient,"You know, he was never like I don't have distinct memories of him being like like gnarly towards her as being fat."
527.0,Provider,But he would pick on Stacey. For sure that's interesting. Like why why CC. vs or even you know your mom in both of both the sisters like I know.
15640.0,Patient,"So yeah I don't know it's funny because, like you know everybody's got different memories, you know my dad died. Like 16 years ago 2004 15 years ago. And you know I have never raised him, just like Stacy right being both like he was an awesome dad to me as a son. You know, up until the seventh grade when he had this accident and then you know just have these like like warm memories of him. being engaged with me I played baseball he really like that I. played in the all stars and you can all the games and keep my mom would be friends with all the like baseball parents and like no that was just sort of something we did. Time was always allocated for it and those were just super positive memories for me and and then you know hyper aware that key and Stacy had tension and you know. Just like you know and then after his accident just his fall from grace, which I think is you know, not an uncommon trope for children of parents and I feel like my dad was on kind of an accelerated path, and you know, Sarah in parallel sort of looking at her father he's still alive. And just sort of tracking his sort of arc of like good dad very good dad really interesting person and just collapsing down to like this unrecognizable. entity like I bet some so. You know he's just like. A weird dude who just doesn't seem is interesting in his oddly incapable of caring for himself and weird way, so he. kind of remarried was involved in this like. super from the outside. super fucked up relationship with this woman. You know, and they think recently broke up but he's still like pays her rent to limit one of her properties nearby and like. he's you sort of confessed to Sarah that he's like i'm a cusp of homelessness but like can very concerned about his homelessness like his prospects of being homeless, which is irrational and he is prone to those sort of like extreme. condition. which of course I can relate to, but like you know it's just like put the shoe on your daughter. I don't care that she's grown like I can take care of yourself dude you had. All these decades to get your shit together. And that's your business and then I don't mean to sound like it's not. Sure, like not you know sort of a cooperative group of people who come together to make sure everyone's successful but it's just like you know this view of sort of broken men, you know that Walter Mitty view of the world of just this like. yeah you know truly at the core broken dude seems to be like everywhere, I look."
527.0,Provider,yeah so where Where are you seeing your worldview at this point is it shifting is it changing is it. Question me.
15640.0,Patient,"i'm just yeah it honestly it hasn't changed much at all I just like. i'm enjoying eating food. I don't know that I should be it feels weird to do it. there's definitely like i'm days, where i'll eat like the Six, for you know at lunch breakfast lunch dinner and then two snacks and evenings act like the six times it gets very mechanical you know, like. i'm not hungry, I will do this. So yeah I don't know I don't I wouldn't be able to track that just even in the last month that my worldview is is really changed."
527.0,Provider,"No, I was just curious I was just curious you know just because you, you know you've mentioned just some things that you know. Just more awareness, I should say of things like. Questioning things and confused about things, and you know, is this. Is this you know tho Those were my you know beliefs growing up, and now being challenged on looking at some of those things, or how you view yourself or. anything."
15640.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I mean, I think that if. there's one thing that i've been more open to it's like you know how do I divorce sort of the connotations around fatness and you know. Whatever the right next adjective is goodness, you know. And, and I don't know that i'll ever get to that place like I don't know that i'll ever be able to like even when I was working out of time, like, I also think, I have a pretty severe case of like body dysmorphia. You know i'd gotten down to like I think like I was fitting into some like 36 inch waist pants mostly 38 comfortably down to an extra large sure. And I look in the mirror and I don't know that I see any difference like oh i've lost 80 pounds, but like I don't see it like I just all the same bits of my body. So you know that's that's always going to be a struggle for me as well."
527.0,Provider,"yeah just that this very distorted body image and that's not uncommon at all, either so."
15640.0,Patient,"Again, such disdain and shame. Even in even in a more sort of conventionally socially. Acceptable money, time."
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah because is there at any point that you would be okay with your body.
15640.0,Patient,"there's asked me that the time. And I can't. I want to say yes, and I have no idea if that's true."
527.0,Provider,yeah is would there be a number that would be good enough.
15640.0,Patient,"See, I think the number is misleading I think it's all about kind of how it looks. But I don't know that i'll ever be able to. reconcile how my body looks and how I like how I interpret how my body looks. Like I don't know that I can ever make that bridge."
527.0,Provider,How has your body let you down.
15640.0,Patient,yeah just being so big right like that's that's the letdown is the largeness.
527.0,Provider,Because.
15640.0,Patient,I don't want to be like this. yeah.
527.0,Provider,"And, and the hard part two, is looking at genetics to. And you know and realizing that that plays into our body and and no matter how we try to manipulate it, it may still you know still be there because that's our genetics like. You know, we can't change certain things. So much as we want to. And what we think with behaviors doesn't necessarily change it. So, are you feeling like the emotions are starting to come to the surface, more as you're. Trying to eliminate. The restricting and the benching behaviors."
15640.0,Patient,"yeah a little bit, but you know I they feel also like a lot of the emotions of restricting and binge eating right it's all about. Like am I doing the right thing, am I, putting the right things in my body, am I going to achieve the desired outcome, and like it's the same questions it's just taking a different. kind of taking a different approach to it, but I feel like the emotions are all still like that the same for me as of now. You know it's still just like lots of shame lots of anxiety lots of. Lots of regret and lots of self hate lots of. your desire for it to be different desire for to be different than a very accelerated curve and. yeah and very little acceptance like that's. The acceptance seems so and intolerable to me. yeah."
527.0,Provider,"Well, and you're not going to be there yet so."
15640.0,Patient,yeah yeah five.
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah because first of all we've got to get to a point of not doing the behaviors. And really figuring out what is your body going to do without the behaviors, and that is the scary part of all of this, too, is. You know, am I am I gonna you know go to the other extreme of you know, the 500 pounds glued to the couch like you said, and so no, we obviously don't want you going like that either. But it is trying to figure out like where where is kind of my natural range for myself without manipulating it. mm hmm and the one thing I noticed, too, is just how diet focused your thoughts are. Do you do you recognize that, like do you notice how intense and how kind of intrusive those are for you."
15640.0,Patient,"Sure, but what other thoughts should be there."
527.0,Provider,"Well, what would What would it be like Scott for you to just eat and not have to think about it."
15640.0,Patient,"Honestly, I can't even go back in time far enough with clarity to think of a time I didn't put food in my mouth and not have some question about it. Literally everybody."
527.0,Provider,wow. yeah.
15640.0,Patient,So. So I can't I can't even honestly I don't even know how to process that question.
527.0,Provider,"Sure yeah definitely definitely. So you mentioned at the beginning, though, just a lot of like your your heads of mass what, what do you want to do as far as homework in that area, what do you, what do you think would be helpful in that area."
15640.0,Patient,um I don't know I mean. I think my head is pretty continuously in a messy state so. i'm open to you know i'm open to anything I don't I don't know that I can self guide on that.
527.0,Provider,"I mean, do you want to do just kind of some free writing just all the thoughts and feelings that are whatever them, however, you want to define the mess is. or a picture of it like if you wanted to draw what it looked like what it's what it's you know if I you know did opened your head and then looked in what I would see like do you. What why don't we get better results for me writing. Okay yeah. yeah either way. Like whatever you feel most connected to that might help just to describe that mess."
15640.0,Patient,um it's just freeform.
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah no. No, no, no rules or expectations around it it's it's just a free right yeah."
