ID,Role,Message
11279.0,Patient,School so we're doing this little car.
706.0,Provider,Okay long as you're not moving we're good to go.
11279.0,Patient,"Well, I don't have to be home for like another half hour so. We can do we can do this. Another appointment."
706.0,Provider,So um. what's been going on.
11279.0,Patient,well. I kind of just been trying to. figure out how to believe Austin and see that he's trying to do this. Yesterday I went through his lunch box and I found condoms. We don't use condoms. He works at the dump things that he found them in the trash and that he liked the logos on them. But still.
706.0,Provider,that's kind of suspicious people don't typically collect condoms.
11279.0,Patient,"I don't know. So he had already used them in my mind, or he was planning to. I don't know. I really kind of want to just leave before he gets home. today. I don't know I feel like I can't believe anything he says to me right now. So."
706.0,Provider,"When you confront him about things like that does he get defensive or is he, like completely calm, how does he react towards you."
11279.0,Patient,"um. Yesterday he was lacking like. He said he found them in the trash and I said, you understand how this looks right now right and he said yeah but i'm telling you I found them in the trash and I said you expect me to believe that and then he got shitty. So. I don't know."
706.0,Provider,Have you guys thought about the couples counseling.
11279.0,Patient,"I told him that if he wants to do that, then he's gonna have to be the one to initiate it because. i'm not fighting for this anymore alone I can't do it."
706.0,Provider,uh huh and What did he say.
11279.0,Patient,"He didn't really say anything that's the thing when I talked to him about it, he doesn't really say much he kind of just locks up and gets quiet so. um. I don't know Yes, he is he's around us more and stuff but. I feel like the only way to get through this is to talk through it and. I don't know if I find you I don't know if I told you about the text that I found it as phone two weeks ago. That said. It was a deleted text that he had accidentally snapchat or a snap like took a screenshot of. That is deleted pictures and it said it was to savannah and it said. It was talking about how much he really liked her and how. He and I were on a break, which we were never on a break and then he was telling her that he was he didn't want to be with me that he was basically waiting for me to leave so that he could be with her that was on Sep tember second. And on the first on the first is when that was literally not even an hour later was when he sat down and looked me in the eye and told me that he cheated on so. Do you think, having a hard. Time believing last, the last thing that he said to her. Which is what he's telling me right now."
706.0,Provider,"So did you confront him with that. Yes, and he said."
11279.0,Patient,"First, he lied. Now he just doesn't really say anything he just walks up when I tried to talk about it, so it makes me feel like he's either talking to her still or. I don't know."
706.0,Provider,"So they work together so obviously they can tell you, and they talk to each other at work and."
11279.0,Patient,They don't but.
706.0,Provider,They did they don't talk at work and they don't work together anymore.
11279.0,Patient,"They don't work together they work at the same place, but he says that they don't talk, talk at all."
706.0,Provider,"So the thing is is once trust is broke, if you don't rebuild that trust and you don't. quit. Thinking the worst and every situation. You can't have a stable relationship. You know, like. You know if somebody if somebody finds something and ultimately goes to that place of older cheating, or if he comes home five minutes late. you're like Oh, he was cheating, or if he's acting you know really like suspicious and sneaky you like always cheating. But maybe he's planning a surprise party for you or maybe you know he got stuck in traffic or you know, and those are that you know and, like the surprise party thing obviously you would know, later on, but you know the stuck in traffic, you would have to be able to trust that that's true. And that he didn't stay someplace and talk to somebody and maybe not just her Maybe she moves out of the state and she's gone."
11279.0,Patient,Because I think someone else in my body.
706.0,Provider,"know exactly exactly so it's not her that you're concerned about it's a situation in general, you don't yeah."
11279.0,Patient,"Because i've talked to her. A few times and she's lied to me and. i'm rusty either one of them, so."
706.0,Provider,"Well, no, but I know they exist, no one, a relationship, I know I just I don't trust either one of them, and I don't. know no absolutely you don't. You know I guess I, what I want you to think about is if she was gone out of the picture, would it be different in your head. If you find out if you found like the same things and she was gone out of the picture, would it be different in your head."
11279.0,Patient,Right.
706.0,Provider,"Or would you think Oh, he found somebody else."
11279.0,Patient,Probably. But I don't know he's now that I know he had feelings for and stuff like completely changed it for me yeah.
706.0,Provider,So what does what does life look like without how.
11279.0,Patient,Have you thought about haven't really put much thought into it.
706.0,Provider,So.
11279.0,Patient,"I feel like either way, no matter what I do i'm going to be miserable."
706.0,Provider,Why do you think that.
11279.0,Patient,I don't know. How to be happy.
706.0,Provider,"So you have to know that you deserve so much better. And you have to believe that and that's why I said what does life look like without him because I know that he is your girls bad that is tough really tough. But you're miserable now. Like every day you live in this place of uncertainty and that's the worst place to be and. And this could be at you know if he's not he's not really communicating he's really not trying to show you that he's trustworthy again. And that, I mean people in this situation, when they really want things to work typically they are bending over backwards, I mean they are. Reporting hey i'm leaving work at this time i'll be home at this time hey just letting you know I. You know i'm on i'll be on lunch in five minutes i'll give you a call hey you know, like they're over communicating over communicating because they want to build that trust again they want to be held accountable. If if those things don't happen you're never going to have that peace of mind you're going to always be in that uncertain place and that is going to be a miserable place for you to be."
11279.0,Patient,Right.
706.0,Provider,and your girls are going to pick up on that. and it's going to change how they develop as young girls as well.
11279.0,Patient,Right.
706.0,Provider,"So that's why I said know what does you know, to think about what does life look like without him. And you said well i'll be miserable but will you will you always been miserable."
11279.0,Patient,I don't know I just can't I can't see it mm hmm.
706.0,Provider,"it's hard it's hard to imagine life without somebody that you love, especially the that your you know your kid's father. Right, you know if you can't trust him. That this is what your next you know 25 years look like is every time something looks, especially as your heads."
11279.0,Patient,going to go.
706.0,Provider,or who's cheating on me. or who are who isn't now you know and and that's not fair to you.
11279.0,Patient,Right.
706.0,Provider,"Are you. So you aren't you keep saying you know you, you want to leave like I want to leave before he gets home, I want to leave you know, like these, all these different things, what do you mean like the for the day leave for a couple days leave."
11279.0,Patient,If I leave i'm i'm leaving for good.
706.0,Provider,"So you thought about it, you just. figure out what that's gonna look like."
11279.0,Patient,Right.
706.0,Provider,Where would okay Where would you go.
11279.0,Patient,Either my sister's house probably my sister's house okay.
706.0,Provider,she's aware of the situation. And the good support for you.
11279.0,Patient,yeah okay.
706.0,Provider,What does she say.
11279.0,Patient,she's wanted me to live she wanted me to leave a long time ago. Just tired of this I know.
706.0,Provider,Can you flip on your camera so I can see if you freeze up because I feel like i'm losing yeah.
11279.0,Patient,Oh sorry.
706.0,Provider,Oh no that's okay so um so you were talking about your sister and kind of what she.
11279.0,Patient,She wanted me to leave a long time.
706.0,Provider,Before this cheating thing happened or before.
11279.0,Patient,"Like right. Well, I mean as soon as I found out, he was talking to somebody that wasn't me and that he was lying to me and hiding to me I knew in my heart that he cheated on me but. Of course, more lies well I just kept building up and. As soon as soon as she found out that he was lying to me, she told me to leave yeah."
706.0,Provider,"So I mean and that's the thing you know, like I said. You found out. Something that is, I think I think the two worst things you can do to somebody is lie to them, because then you don't respect them enough to tell them the truth. You know, and along with lying obviously comes cheating and deceit and all of which were happening. and You confronted him about it. If you would not have confronted him do you think he would have told you."
11279.0,Patient,know I probably never would have found out. And then he probably would have fallen in there and try to break up with me and blamed it on not that and. I don't really know I don't know what would have happened but.
706.0,Provider,Or is he. doing the same thing to her that he's doing to you is he telling her all the things he thinks that she wants to hear.
11279.0,Patient,Now you will.
706.0,Provider,You want to hear so he can have his cake and eat it too.
11279.0,Patient,We was doing yeah he was definitely going up.
706.0,Provider,"Have you asked him have you have you said, if we didn't have children, together, would you still be here."
11279.0,Patient,"No, I haven't asked him."
706.0,Provider,"Because he's seeing because I mean that's always something important and are you staying for for me, for us, for our love for this relationship for our future, or are you saying I have your girls. He has if you're just here for these girls, I mean. You know and that's what you need to say to them because, and I if that I mean I think that's how you would feel you don't want him just to stick around for the kids you want him to be there for you. Because you deserve that you deserve to have somebody that worships the ground that you walk on I mean, like every woman deserves that. They deserve to feel loved you know, like they deserve to you know get a kiss goodbye in the morning and a kiss Hello at night when they get you know their partner comes home and. You know they get the little pieces of affection, you know all those little things that make you feel secure and loved."
11279.0,Patient,he's been doing those things but.
706.0,Provider,But now it feels fake.
11279.0,Patient,Right.
706.0,Provider,"Like he's just trying to cover up the things that he's already done. So. When he does get close to you, and he you know shows you, you know, like affection and anyway How does that make you feel."
11279.0,Patient,"I don't know I feel like for a long time, the only thing I wanted from me with sex hmm so. I don't know it does make me suspicious so. I don't know what to think or believe anymore."
706.0,Provider,"Does it make you like uneasy the he's he's touching you and, like he touched her like do you get that feeling of you just don't even want them to touch you. Have you told him that."
11279.0,Patient,Yes.
706.0,Provider,And what does he say.
11279.0,Patient,"He gets kind of angry. I don't know I feel like I feel like if you really wanted to make this work, then you would be going over the moon. So he's crying a little bit. yeah not not."
706.0,Provider,"What is he so what's he angry about did you ask them like what are you so angry about I didn't cheat on you have you ever said that to him. Because I don't think that's that he's allowed to be angry, I mean I always say people are allowed to feel how they feel and all their feelings are legitimate, but for him when he put the relationship in this place, he doesn't really get that right to be angry. Plenty he needs to put you know basically his head between his legs admit that he really amped up the relationship and move having a nurse defect set. You know. yeah so. Especially knowing you know somebody who can put somebody through something so traumatic like this, I mean you just you know you just had a baby, you have another little girl. you're also in recovery. And so to me that's even one more layer of the cake because you're in instability in life. could potentially and hasn't and thank goodness, it has not could send you off of your path of recovery, how is that going to affect you how's that going to affect your children. You know, and so before you traumatize somebody with something like cheating and you know you think about you know what that ripple effect does, and how does that affect everybody else."
11279.0,Patient,Right.
706.0,Provider,"And what would he do without you, you know, like what if he had those girls on his own. And you know, could he do it."
11279.0,Patient,or not.
706.0,Provider,"So I mean like that's the thing you know he needs to think about is. It even if you two don't make the relationship work, you need to be able to coexist, and both be healthy, in your individual bides for your children. Because they need both of you."
11279.0,Patient,alright.
706.0,Provider,"So. You know. Do you feel do you feel like financially, you can do it on your own."
11279.0,Patient,No there's no way okay.
706.0,Provider,So is that one is that one of the things that's scaring you to leave.
11279.0,Patient,Okay. I have no means of. Any financial stability right now okay.
706.0,Provider,"So you would get child support from him. And you can file for child support child support on both of the children. and Obviously, would have to find work, you know, find a job. But I mean there's. There people. People do it all this time and there's you know different programming and stuff that's available and, obviously, your sister's wedding you stay with her so she you know you could get back on your feet."
11279.0,Patient,she's got. kids so.
706.0,Provider,She has what.
11279.0,Patient,"Eight kids. Eight oh my gosh that's a couple of a couple of them aren't hers but it's a really, really full house and that's another reason why i'm struggling i'm going because it's a lot i'd be reading my sanctuary to kind of go into chaos and."
706.0,Provider,"And can you do that, and then. Is it is that a fair place for your girls to be because that's a lot of kids."
11279.0,Patient,and
706.0,Provider,"So and i'm not telling you whether to leave or not leave i'm just asking you to kind of look like What would it look like, if you did. And then, if that's not the outcome that you want, you know, but you still need to leave okay so then what's a different plan different approach, you know. Is this something where you know you you start planning to leave and you give it a certain amount of time, like you give it three months, and this relationship, to see if you find condoms again if you have any suspicions."
11279.0,Patient,"I told him last month that he had a month to show me and. Since then, I found out that he is completely had feelings, for her and been lying to me that. So he was showing me."
706.0,Provider,"So there's a program out there. That you can put on somebody's phone. And you get live what they do so, you get live all their text messages you get live all of their snaps you get live everything. But he has to let you put that on his phone. However, if he has nothing to hide."
11279.0,Patient,Know he's got I don't think he's doing anything on his phone anymore he's got a work phone so.
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11279.0,Patient,So you can send things if anything's going on it's on his work phone.
706.0,Provider,"Do you have access to that. This does he bring it home with them. No, so it stays there. So that's another uncertainty that you have no clue about because. You know, then you have the other side, but can I mean, in reality, is it possible that he's doing that, on his phone typically people don't use their work phones to have affairs, but nothing it doesn't happen. um. Does he have any friends like guy friends."
11279.0,Patient,"Not not that, not that I don't know."
706.0,Provider,"you're in a really tough spot. And the only thing that you can do is look at kind of both sides of the coin and say Okay, this is what life is going to look like, if I stay. This is what life is going to look like, if I leave. And then you have to decide, because if you say if I look at it this way when I measure things out if somebody stays someplace that they're unhappy and that's a question every day if they are. loved respected, you know all of the things that you're supposed to have in relationship. you're never going to find happiness because you're going to constantly be double guessing what's going on. On the other side if you leave. It could definitely be tough being a single mom it's have I was a single mom of my son my oldest son until he was eight years old. it's."
11279.0,Patient,challenging.
706.0,Provider,You know.
11279.0,Patient,But it makes you a stronger person.
706.0,Provider,Because you did it on your own your.
11279.0,Patient,"so tired, are you strong."
706.0,Provider,"I know. But the strength that you show always remember the strength that you show in your life. That will make your girls strong women because they will say you know i'm strong like my mom like my mom taught me how to be strong, my mom taught me to stand up for what I believe in my mom taught me I deserve to be treated like the wonderful person that I am."
11279.0,Patient,"I don't want them to have to see me a strong, though I want them to see me love them yeah happen."
706.0,Provider,"Yes, and but are you going to have that they're it, I mean, and I, and I obviously don't know day to day which you go through, but from what you're telling me is you don't feel that way. And so. And you are, you know young and beautiful and smart and you like you're all of these things, and I think you forget when you look in the mirror all of the great things you are, I think you look in the mirror you see yourself as. You know, a mother and a wife to be and that's why I said it was so important, you know when you got when you got that job that was really important. And how you got treated that what treated there, I mean that's terrible and that just adds to everything that you're going through i'm sure. i'm you know just being disrespected and you know. violated. Because it kind of as a reflection of the relationship that you're in you felt disrespected and violated and so that really takes a hit to your self esteem and takes a hit to the your person, how you feel about yourself. And I just I want you to really think about. Being strong enough to say I deserve better and leaving doesn't mean that it's forever. doesn't mean that once you leave it's done it's over if you if you don't want it to be, but it's a nice break. And a break, to see what does he do with that. Is he at your sister's door every night begging you to come home. or."
11279.0,Patient,I don't think you'll do that.
706.0,Provider,"we'll see that's what I mean I mean that's just an example, but I mean is he spending every waking minute besides his work hours trying to get you back is he sending you flowers, as he begging you to come back is he banging on the door being like I miss you come home. Is he doing anything during that period of time to make you think that he can't live without you. Or is he taking it as a nice vacation from the relationship. Because. If he doesn't change anything that he does during the time that you're gone. If he doesn't make you feel like you're everything to him. Do you really want to be with somebody like that. You know I guess. He proposed to you, he wanted to spend his life with you, and then you even you take his girls he doesn't respond in a pretty dramatic way. You know. doesn't that say a lot about. how important it is to him. Is there a part of you that's. scared that. If you do leave you aren't going to get the reaction that you want, and then you're going to know for sure."
11279.0,Patient,"that's what i'm saying, I think it will leave that's going to be good."
706.0,Provider,"So the financial peace and kind of where you need where you go is the two things weighing on you, what else weighs on you as far as leaving."
11279.0,Patient,The kids.
706.0,Provider,The kids as in like not being with their dad.
11279.0,Patient,Anastasia she's not. he's not her dad her biological dad but she calls him dad and don't be scared to that. Apart again. mm hmm but he's kind of already done that so.
706.0,Provider,So she she doesn't have any relationship with her biological dad.
11279.0,Patient,No okay.
706.0,Provider,"So. So, leaving with then. you're worried that he would be like Oh well, she's not mine and I don't need to support her and I don't need to because he didn't actually adopt her Daddy."
11279.0,Patient,No okay.
706.0,Provider,So you're afraid she's going to get just shoved off to the side because biologically she's that has. Do you think he would do that.
11279.0,Patient,I don't know I really don't know I don't even know who he is anymore so.
706.0,Provider,Do you think he would be willing to come to a therapy session with you.
11279.0,Patient,Maybe I don't know.
706.0,Provider,"So if you wanted to you could have a therapy session, you know with you and I, and you could have him involved in it, you can have anybody involved in your therapy sessions that you want, because if they're your sessions. and If you think that he would be willing to do that if you think that it might how that'd be something i'd be open to I can even open up my schedule to make an evening, where you're both available so that you can have him there, because I know that he works during the day."
11279.0,Patient,When we talk through first see if you can do that yeah.
706.0,Provider,"You can just let me know, but I can open up you know, an evening that so that I can be available during a time that works. You know, and if he's willing to do that, then. Maybe I can ask him some of those harder questions that maybe he's not answering for you."
11279.0,Patient,Right.
706.0,Provider,"You know, sometimes sometimes having somebody."
11279.0,Patient,"frozen right there yeah did you hear and I said, you said something about facility."
706.0,Provider,"yeah so sometimes an outside party, but a neutral party facilitating a conversation gives better insight into what the situation really is because typically the person or people are just too close to the situation to see it for what it is, does that make sense yeah. And I know I know you said that you have to you have another appointment, or something that you have to get to."
11279.0,Patient,I live like 30 minutes away from where i'm at right now. yeah i'm part that one needs right next to my daughter's school so. completely forgot to go home. i'm.
706.0,Provider,"I just I just lost you for like a few seconds, you were frozen again."
11279.0,Patient,"I said oh I gotta get driving home, I live like a half hour away from now."
706.0,Provider,"that's what I that's what I had just said is, I think."
11279.0,Patient,You did.
706.0,Provider,"To get going, so we can go ahead and under session, I just want you to think about that's the stuff that we talked about, because I think it's really time to to look at you know. What are going to be the pros to leaving versus the pros to staying and what's the kinds of leaving versus the cons to say it's to staying and. And really see what which outweighs the other, and you know and having that conversation like. You know, maybe don't even you know, give them a choice, like, I want you to meet with my therapist with me because I need for you. And I to talk I need I need for us to have that conversation and a therapeutic setting and it really maybe just don't give them a choice feel like and if you can't do that."
11279.0,Patient,be there.
706.0,Provider,"And if you don't have a person in line and appointment made for us, then, that shows that you're not committed. You know this isn't this isn't on his timeframe, this is he doesn't get to drag this out, as long as he wants to, because all this is doing is making it harder for you and harder for those girls. You know, he. It almost seems like he feels like he's the one that was wrong and that's absolutely not what happened. Sorry just. Think about those things, think about it, maybe you want to do a session I guess i'd be more than happy to try and facilitate. Absolutely. and take care of you. You know and love on those girls because. They don't even realize it, but they need, you know you need their snuggles more than they need yours, you know, like sometimes it's just snuggling up with your your kids can just make it all go away, you know. Right, you know and and just stay strong and just know that if you need anything you know you know get Ahold of bright heart they'll get Ahold of me, we can do an extra session or you know. If you need to be seen weekly for a little bit to get you over. through all of this, we can do that, I mean there's things that we can do, I can help you get in contact with the case manager from bright heart, they can help you to. figure out, you know things in your area like you know housing stuff like that, like you know there's there's probably programs out there, that you can sign up for. You know just take it one step at a time, if you decide that you need to leave for your own mental health and for your own recovery and stability and your own just self worth and. You know, there are places out there that can help you so. You know, and I can help you to figure that out too and come up with a plan."
11279.0,Patient,Thank you.
706.0,Provider,So um but you need to get going so i'll let you go and. Do you have another appointment set up.
11279.0,Patient,No i'll make i'll have to make one I have to log into the clinic one.
706.0,Provider,"OK OK that's fine all right, well, I will see you in group next week, like I said, if anything happens and you need some extra support just reach out."
11279.0,Patient,"I know, thank you."
706.0,Provider,And you have my email to feel free to use it. yeah cuz I emailed you. that's my yeah that's my brain heart email.
11279.0,Patient,Okay cool.
706.0,Provider,yep so you can just email me to if you need to.
11279.0,Patient,Thank you.
706.0,Provider,yep you're welcome.
11279.0,Patient,You too.
