462.0,Provider,Hello.
12971.0,Patient,hi how are you.
462.0,Provider,"i'm doing good, how are you. Good yeah so how is everything going with you, I know you had to cancel the appointment, so I haven't seen you in a little. Can you hear me."
12971.0,Patient,"We okay froze for me, is it King hear me."
462.0,Provider,I can see you and hear you now yeah.
12971.0,Patient,"Okay yeah I just like switch my wife, because it was being worried and he kept cutting out but Okay, I think it's good now."
462.0,Provider,"yeah I think I can hear you better yeah so how's everything been going for you, I it's been a little while since i've seen now."
12971.0,Patient,"i'm um yeah it's been. Going it's been going i've been on winter break so that's been nice when I say like have a break from school and just like chill like my family and stuff like that I just got my. Co producer yesterday so last night I was kind of it was really rough I was like literally like a second, the second vaccine shot but it's been good we go back go back to school on Sunday so that'll be nice to just like start to the next quarter. i'm a little nervous for the next quarter, because I feel like my classes are going to be a little more hard, but I don't know we'll see. But yeah and then actually husband kind of I know we've talked about like being home and like what that brings up and stuff for me, and I feel like. it's been really good and kind of like i'm kinda ready to go back because, like just a few days ago my brother actually tested positive for coven so was kind of a whole thing, and you just quarantine whatever and you just kind of tough because. I feel like me and my sister kind of have to step up and like take care of him, and like do whatever he needs and, like my mom doesn't really take that initiative to do so, we just so annoying it's like okay like. You should be the one that's like more concerned and, like you're doing seven I feel like she just kind of brushes it off kind of nonchalant. And i'm like I don't like I don't understand like why you just like not kind of like I don't know like. Make it, you know have it be like more of a big deal and like take care months of not just like be like oh it's fine it's whatever like which I guess it will be fine, but so like I don't know, I just wish he, like took more. initiative, I guess, and like that, like mall role which I feel like she didn't even were younger and like figure brings up a lot for me because it's just like annoying that like she. I don't know she looks kind of like a roomie and not like a mom."
462.0,Provider,"If that makes sense yeah it does, and this was kind of one of the biggest things we knew you're going home it's a little bit triggering there because. Obviously, everything that happened the trauma that happened there for you, and then on top of it there's kind of this lack of parenting as you described right lack of emotional parenting especially. And then the big co bad things happen, and you once again have to step up and fill the role of something that's not necessarily entirely your role to fill are entirely your and your sisters role to fill and that's just really hard it's the. kind of continual reminder of the emotional support that you are the motherly emotional support that you don't have."
12971.0,Patient,"yeah and I think it also just bothers me some link with my friends doors and everything like. This is now a chance for me to like kind of make things better, I would say, like work on the relationship with us because I feel like before she kind of had that thing where. Okay, like you know she didn't want to Maybe she want to be home because, like her my dad and fight and they kind of be like absent and like. do that because of that, but like now it's he's only been here so it's like, why not just work on you know, making a venture partner with us and so it's kind of like I don't know just like annoying more annoying this law."
462.0,Provider,"It is yeah it's hard to understand, but it's one of those things where you can't control her choices, or how she's gonna choose to respond and cope with this So what do you think can just help you as you finish off this trip and kind of get through being in a very triggering atmosphere."
12971.0,Patient,"I think, like the other day she's like we were just kind of like going back and forth little, and I was like i'm just going to like. Take a minute like go to my room like just not talk to her, and I think that helps like. Just not even engaging because it's like even when I say something like she doesn't really it doesn't even make sense, like the stuff that she says back as a response so then it just like makes me more mad and then actually thoughts when i'm getting like. Really, just like angry and like triggered, so I think that's when I can take a step back and like should not be around her for a second."
462.0,Provider,"yeah that's a really great response rate so just know rather than getting too wrapped up in it, or too reactive just taking a step away going into a private space or taking a walk or something."
12971.0,Patient,yeah.
462.0,Provider,regrowing yourself.
12971.0,Patient,yeah I think that's like the thing I hate the most is like she always makes excuses for a lot of things and it's so really bothers me and then it's just like. tape thought.
462.0,Provider,"yeah it is it's it's bothersome you know you want something that. Is kind of seemingly natural, which is just them, that support that love that parenting and you're not getting it and then it seems like okay Well now, could be a good time to get it, because he's gone and whatever but it's still not there, which is disappointing, let down really."
12971.0,Patient,"yeah and I think the thought made me think about next year and, like living at home if I like fine like a job that's closer to home or. And then I thought i'm thinking about that more than it was like I don't know it's like. Sometimes i'm like okay it's like not bad, but then sometimes like that i'm like I don't know like I just feel like it's so nice, because now like I have that. thing we're like Okay, even if i'm kind of like I know what or whatever here like it's only like a few more days and then i'm going back to do is going back to school. But if I was living here then it's like I don't have that just you know getting away and like being my own space that really makes me nervous."
462.0,Provider,"Understandably, did you get a confirmation from that job that's in your home area like did they offer it to you."
12971.0,Patient,"yeah they did offer it so basically there was there's there was two weeks to accept it, so I just accepted it, for now, but i'm still applying for other places, just like email options open. Sure, I yeah I don't know I think like I do, I did really the company it's like everything would, I think the only thing is like just living at home, would be like be."
462.0,Provider,"Good so obviously with an offer comes a salary, so we talked about maybe kind of breaking down your salary and seeing if you could just realistically rent your own place. I know that part of that is financial and part of it is also just emotional and their risk your family's response to you doing that what. what's your thoughts on that."
12971.0,Patient,"um yeah so I did look into it like a little bit, and I mean it would be doable for sure um. But yeah I think it just be like my family's criticism about it, because they would be like why you save money into your home, but then let them really understand like. The mental part of it, I feel like they're it's like be I don't know yeah they don't understand it all the way, or they just I mean like for them, I guess, they just value, like other things more than that."
462.0,Provider,"yeah So this is the This is where the hard part comes in the part of having to establish boundaries and make choices that people don't agree with, and you having to just stand firm in your and confident in your own decisions do you think you're you're ready to do that."
12971.0,Patient,"um. No, I honestly don't think i'm ready for it but that's kind of why i'm just like been applying for everywhere else and other things and stuff so then that way like. I feel like it's still kinda early, so I don't really even have to make the decision for like a while, because i'm glad you're told June and, like, I would even start the job like July, so I don't know or maybe like I could even if I do end up like teen that one. I could always. Like try it out try living at home out and if I don't love it then maybe after that, like figure out what else to do I don't know."
462.0,Provider,"yeah so you can think about it, the good news is is like you said you do have about six months until you're actually done with school so it's something you can think about and even journal about like pros and cons thinking about your experience there this. holiday break and, if you think that's something you can be healthy and permanent well obviously not like lifelong permanently but semi-permanently living and working."
12971.0,Patient,"yeah no, I think, so too. yeah I think it's just still everything also, I think I think i've talked about this, but being home, I feel like. there's more I like have to think about like my parents like gabor's my opinions, like all that, like a lot more just because, like. Sometimes, like people like some my mom's family like holds her and talks about it so, then I hear them talking or like. it's just like I feel like anytime like even yesterday we had some people come from out of town and they like brought it up. And it's just like I feel like that's like the topic that's just been broadband like for the last almost like a year now and it's just like Okay, can we just like start talking about and like. Because they'll just keep being like oh like I heard that your dad did this or doing this, or whatever and it's like okay I don't."
462.0,Provider,Care like I don't want to get yeah definitely that's really hard so I mean I would really strongly encourage you to consider if. You can be healthy and I don't just mean physically healthy and emotionally safe in that space semi-permanently.
12971.0,Patient,"yeah. No yeah I think it's just again like very triggering and just like annoying but. I think the also the thing with like some people is like. Some of like some dis family doesn't really know, like the dynamics of like you know how their relationship was in whatever and actually they're always kind of like oh like well I don't you guys like want to give him a chance and it's like I don't know. it's just annoying because it's like you don't first of all, you don't know everything that's like gone on, and then also like. You know, nobody gets to this point, without giving somebody a chance, like I don't know."
462.0,Provider,"Those are the type of just really tough comments to be constantly bombarded with and just reliving it right like just constantly having to relive the trauma through people asking you to give another chance or Oh, I heard this happened, or that happened that's really hard yeah."
12971.0,Patient,"yeah so I feel like i've just been trying to like. Honestly it's kind of hard isn't like okay like I kind of get like really going from like it would be hard to like. I don't know understands what else's situation have you know, been in it, I guess, or like anything similar but still just like I try not to. dwell on or talk about it so much because it's like I don't want to like keep talking about and then like. Just be stuck in that, like, I want to move forward and I feel like that's like will be good for like my whole family to especially movie you and Mike Mike Hopefully she move forward, then like she could start getting out of that like kind of negative mindset."
462.0,Provider,"Absolutely, I mean unless you're doing true trauma therapy, with a trained therapist there's really no benefit to reliving stories and repeating stories in fact it's actually really worse to be doing that."
12971.0,Patient,"yeah. I don't know um let's just feel like a whole thing I don't know, maybe hopefully."
462.0,Provider,puts you in a tough position it really does.
12971.0,Patient,"yeah I don't know I honestly I always thought my sister and i'm like I literally don't like I have no idea how like you live here and do it, like all the time. Because it's just like I don't know I feel like she kind of feels similar to me about like my moments of always talk about it so it's kind of Nice, we can like just talk about it's coming, we can click rant rant about her and talk about it together. And then."
462.0,Provider,it's helpful to have someone at least to relate to.
12971.0,Patient,"yeah and. A few weeks ago, actually one of my sister's friends passed away, and I know we've talked about like I know i've talked about like kind of like being more like emotional like to my toward my sister and whatever and I feel like that was kind of a situation where like. Well, I could test it I don't know so i've been trying to do that more."
462.0,Provider,yeah that's great.
12971.0,Patient,"Since i've been home and like. Since i've been home, and I feel like i've figured out maybe it's not always for me like saying like saying exactly how I feel or like saying like oh I love you or whatever that might be but. More so like I just like try to help her out with like Oh, like a clean your room or like oh i'll go pour gas in your car whatever like those types of things that you need, and I think that's like an easier way for me to like. Show like I don't know that I care versus like actually like saying it."
462.0,Provider,"mm hmm. So yeah that's actions and sometimes again just the cliche actions speak louder than words, but a lot of times they do actually and. You know she's in a tough situation, so this was a great opportunity for you to try to kind of show that care you feel uncomfortable speaking out like you said, the words I love you so maybe for you action is kind of your love language and that's more comfortable for you."
12971.0,Patient,"yeah no, I think that actually like I always I don't know I feel like i've thought like Oh, I need to say it, and so, but, honestly, like it makes me feel like. Better just like do things and stuff like that, and then does me feel so uncomfortable either I don't know and maybe I feel like doing like doing more things or whatever, will help in like this, saying, if I want thought."
462.0,Provider,"yeah So what do you what would be your ideal like moving forward in your relationship with your sister, what do you envision as like your ideal relationship and how you fit into that and how she fits."
12971.0,Patient,"um. I don't know honestly I feel like I didn't even think about like the auctions thing for and maybe that's like how I always used to like show show it I don't know I never really even yeah like I never really thought about it till now, but. I feel like moving forward, I would just like want it, where like. I don't know probably just like where. I feel like comfortable whether that's in like just comfortable and like sharing things and like. I don't know we could play actually talk about like emotions and stuff like that versus like not being able to do that as much. i'm like feeling."
462.0,Provider,yeah.
12971.0,Patient,"I don't know so yeah I don't know about like saying faint like saying words of affirmation type thing or. not been um yeah I think i've just like realized that, like the actions thing I know I just never realized before so it's kind of like nice to see that, like, I can do that in a different way that doesn't make me feel uncomfortable."
462.0,Provider,"Okay yeah that sounds like a good plan moving forward for you to just kind of express your love, in that way and, and you can kind of continue to think about what your ideal relationship is with her as well and. See if there's any other way to formulate it. that's. Some good follow up on that it seemed like it kind of happened, naturally, and that she had that loss, and so it gave you the opportunity to practice."
12971.0,Patient,"yeah and I think like I don't know it is nice when it's like I think that's why I was kind of surprised by it, because, like. I feel like I was thinking about it a lot, and then, when that something like that happened, like you, kind of I just like it was natural so as like I figured out kind of the way that I like to express, like my emotions strikingly maybe."
462.0,Provider,"yeah and that's actually great because sometimes us feeling pressured to express things in a way that isn't comfortable. it's good to challenge yourself sure, but if it just truly isn't comfortable and isn't going to happen then and there's another way, then why not just do what works for you right."
12971.0,Patient,yeah I think I was like thinking too much about like what I should do I should do.
462.0,Provider,A lot of pressure on you and you alone.
12971.0,Patient,yeah dislike. So.
462.0,Provider,"Okay yeah that's good and that gives a good path forward there so maybe you think about just some actions you can do over the next couple weeks to continue that relationship right because it's. obvious that you care and you want to keep moving forward in the relationship so maybe you think about how you can move forward, rather than just trying to push yourself to a point of feeling uncomfortable but other things you can do, where you do feel comfortable."
12971.0,Patient,"yeah no definitely um, I think, then, like of ways, like I mentioned before, like sometimes my family I get annoyed easier and, like, I think that would probably be something that I want to work on like Ideally I wouldn't want them to it as your team has fast. Though. All right, I think that's probably like something and that's like that's probably the one thing, where i'm like Okay, we need to work on that, but like. I think, with my mama will be definitely like way more hard just because, like she actually does say things that like I think would annoy anyone or like just makes you mad. But I feel like with like my sister I can like work on it more."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, how do you think you can work on it, one thing that comes to mind for me that you said is just sometimes taking a step away when you need to and returning later anything else."
12971.0,Patient,"I don't know I feel like. yeah probably taking a step back, like aware like if I don't feel like hang out or like whatever user friendly like don't feel like talking to anyone so like. Maybe not putting myself in a situation where i'm with someone say like get your teacher like with her or I think honestly just making like a more conscious effort to like not be like. I don't know like not feel annoyed when she says he is like it's not even things that she says really I don't know. I think it's just like when you're with your I don't know like when i'm with her she's just like my siblings so it's just like i'm like Oh, whatever like it doesn't really matter so if I like, if I am like. If I say something like kind of a little mean or whatever like it doesn't matter because it's like my sister, but then I feel like I wouldn't do that to any of my friends or anything, so I think I need to like switch that."
462.0,Provider,"Sure, then that could be a really good way to start to switch it is first of all, just the conscious awareness that you described so just being a little bit more aware. In the moment right a little bit more connected, so you can just kind of take a deep breath and then say like Okay, so if this were my friend, how would I react and just try to kind of start reframing and a bit and. You can and it's okay to acknowledge that it's annoying but you don't need to let it emotionally affect you so much, so you can start to just take a deep breath reframe it and even separate from it, if you need to rather than getting kind of wrapped up in it, and that that annoyed feeling. yeah response."
12971.0,Patient,"yeah no I don't know if i've actually saw before, but I heard one of my roommate's she talks to her, like her older sister and like she's always kind of like. know what the word is she's always kind of like short with her like whenever she's on the phone she'll always just be like. Really short and like kind of like that same like annoyance and I always like hear her talking to her and i'm like, why are you like not like she's making you not making enough for you know, like she."
462.0,Provider,needs a nice.
12971.0,Patient,And then I think about i'm like well that's kind of what I do with my sister so it's.
462.0,Provider,"Like actually good to take yourself outside of the situation to and see a broader perspective that's a really great example, so I mean you've got the awareness and you've got the right intentions your care is there and some it and also. it's okay to be annoyed sometimes so I just want to validate that, like you, are allowed to sometimes be annoyed it's not nice to react in a mean way to people, of course, which it sounds like you're not super mean, but you want to work on a little bit so that's great. But also just giving yourself a little bit of grace to like it's."
12971.0,Patient,"yeah I think honestly I will kind of talk to my struggles, but I feel like it has a lot to do with like when we're younger and stuff like that, because, like. I think like when we're when we're younger I feel like she always kind of like I always want to hang out with her and she was pushed me away. And I think that kind of goes into like she wouldn't she wouldn't want me to like hang out with her friends like that you know which is like. I don't know I guess like normal sibling stuff but like still I think just those things kinda like made me not make me more annoyed towards her just for no reason, or like that reason and then also, I think, because I think we talked about this, but. I feel like sometimes she puts me in this box like. I. I don't know like I feel like she thinks of me just like as like sale this like her little sister like young would ever in like so when I don't feel like. I don't know like sometimes when like will be with like our friends and like she'll be there and we're all we're all hugs you're like oh like you know Raj does this, and like whatever like and then I just don't like that so i'm like okay well like. You know I can be my own person like say whatever like I want to say, and like you don't need to put me in like if I say like Oh, I like. I like pink and she's like no you always like blue, like you, like blue like that's just something like that, like you know, and I feel like she doesn't give me the chance to like. I don't know like evolved from the box that she has me and and I think. that's What worries me. And that's that's I think that's what i'm actually annoyed at and they just like makes me not want to like talk to her because i'm like Okay, every time I talk to me i'm just annoyed because then you just like I don't know."
462.0,Provider,"yeah so it sounds like she's just kind of got an attachment to the idea of who you were to her as a sister in the younger years and. It can be hard for people to adapt and adjust that do you think. If you spent just more kind of quality time you and her together she could start to just kind of see and get used to the President, you or do you think she's going to just kind of be stuck there and that's something you can't control."
12971.0,Patient,"um I think what i've been doing is like calling her out Whenever she says a comment like that will be like oh like don't see that because, like I don't know it's like I don't like it so i've been trying to do that, like. For example, a while ago she like said something like I was gonna pick up my boyfriend or something for dinner and then she's like Oh well. Why don't you want to like I don't know like why don't you why don't you make the same effort with me or something like that and i'm like okay it's not like. that's not fair because it's like two different P, I don't know so I told her that and I said it like that, right there you know not and then she was like okay like yeah like I won't do that, so I think just telling her like when she does. I don't know."
462.0,Provider,yeah that's great it's if you can communicate to her and she's able to sometimes say okay that makes sense yeah that's as ideal is can be you're being honest and she's listening so maybe continuing to try to communicate clearly in the moment is is helpful.
12971.0,Patient,"yeah I feel like she just me she doesn't realize she's doing it like she didn't see anything wrong with it, or like. She just kind of is like oh it's fine link whatever I don't know, maybe, and I think that's why like me saying something maybe like hopefully will be like okay like don't do that, like you know, obviously I don't like it, so you know. But I don't know I think a lot of bottles all has to do is just like probably my parents and all that and, like just how we differently coped with it when are younger. And I think like. Again, she likes being more Center of attention and I don't, so I think it's just like a difference in how we are so."
462.0,Provider,"Absolutely, it sounds like you have a good understanding and compassion for her, which is important and sometimes it might just come down to that of just this is annoying and you can try to speak up and. Make your place known and what your needs known, but sometimes maybe she's just not going to understand and that could be your differences your different trauma responses and you can still move forward right."
12971.0,Patient,"yeah I feel like also, though, as I think we relate, no, no it's kind of weird because then I feel like also we like relate to each other, a lot because it's like. We know you know, like with our parents and like especially my mom and all that, like we can relate on like how we deal with that, so I think that's where. that's where we kind of I don't know get along better is like when we're kind of leaning on each other for support would like."
462.0,Provider,You know.
12971.0,Patient,"So I guess like that's Nice that we can at least like have that and support each other in it, because I feel like. I don't know If not, it would just be really hard to like feel it."
462.0,Provider,"yeah so you, you have your it's almost like you really just described, your strengths and weaknesses in your relationship with her, and so you can try to keep working on the weaknesses doing all the things that we. discussed and also sometimes maybe just lean on the strength and say all right today's not the best day in our relationship, but tomorrow, I can start fresh or I can step away and take a deep breath and try not to be annoyed."
12971.0,Patient,"yeah honestly I don't know, I think. yeah not would like help just keep like trying to. Just like. I don't know I think just looking at the situation like when I do fill out annoyance and be like Oh, why do I feel annoyed like she actually saving lives."
462.0,Provider,Or am I just that's a good.
12971.0,Patient,Just projecting like random emotion.
462.0,Provider,that's a good idea to just start kind of questioning each time you're late and why getting to the deeper Why am I annoyed is this like you said projection Is this something I need to speak up about that she did that is really annoying and she could understand the change.
12971.0,Patient,"You know. yeah. But. I feel like also now like kind of switching to my relationship, I think, like. This time I think I mentioned last year was like kind of a difficult time with."
462.0,Provider,Everything going on and.
12971.0,Patient,"I think like that's what like. I feel like especially like new year's time last year was like not good at all so like getting closer to that it's like making me more nervous, but like I don't I don't know like. It makes me nervous but it's also like okay like I know it's not I know there's nothing that's like. going to be bad or go wrong or I don't know I don't there's nothing that's going to happen, but also like it just I feel like I keep feeling that, like. More of the anxiety and I think i'm just like I feel like i'm just waiting for that, like especially new year's Eve, and like new year's day to like pass."
462.0,Provider,"yeah that's you know that's just that, in a way, because you're you're triggered and it's trauma from the past, so there was a lot of. Difficulties at this exact same time this year, and you just don't want to experience again so you'd rather just fast forward through, how do you think you can try to either be neutral and just get through it, or maybe even enjoy it obviously new year's Eve is tomorrow, do you have plans."
12971.0,Patient,"yeah I was just gonna like me my sister and her friends from home really going to go to dinner, and like just hang out at home and like have some drinks and stuff like that. So I feel like it will be good, because it's like okay i'm doing stuff like you know my friends and like whatever and it'll be like Nice and like I don't know but. I don't know that's why i'm trying i'm trying to like think about it that way, but then also I feel like since I do feel anxiety i'm like a little nervous with hanging out and like doing that stuff because i'm like what if I just feel like I want to like. I don't know, maybe like I think sometimes when I do feel a little trigger anxiety like. that's when I feel that, like irritated feeling more so I don't I also don't want to like project those feelings on them. So i'm kind of nervous i'm like little shy, just like be home and like just do something alone, but also, I think that probably wouldn't be that good and i'm just gonna."
462.0,Provider,"Not gonna be great yeah. yeah So what about trying to start the day really strong and positive tomorrow, like either doing some yoga or meditation or going for a run I know that's being enjoyed something to just really take care of yourself let yourself know that like you've got this by you know self care. And then, trying to go into the evening with everyone at least a little bit more confident grounded and connected."
12971.0,Patient,"yeah no, I think that would help like I feel like just like taking it really chill and, like the morning and, like the beginning of the day, and like. That would probably help because I think even normally like if i'm just like super busy like the whole day whatever and like don't have any time for myself than just like."
462.0,Provider,"kind of guess that's probably an example of exactly what you shouldn't do, especially with that flight trauma response that we've discussed so just trying to be busy the whole day."
12971.0,Patient,it's it's.
462.0,Provider,"good to have the social time at the in the evening, as he said, like probably not just staying home alone that could end up spiraling but making sure you have some time to relax in the morning and then do something that self care for you a run journal meditate. You know something."
12971.0,Patient,"yeah I don't know I think i'm just like yeah also I kind of like oh sorry. I don't want to feel like I just some trying to like rush through things I don't know. And then also I kind of like Chronicle and stuff like that was just like one bad like experience like. Around time but, like you know. There have been other years were like 100 million God so i'm trying to like think about it, like who holistically and be like okay it's not."
462.0,Provider,Just like.
12971.0,Patient,One bad experience doesn't mean that every school year it'll be bad.
462.0,Provider,"that's important too, so maybe you recall, on the morning when you have this time to just relax a little bit like some really fun new year's Eve, do you have a one that comes straight to my for you."
12971.0,Patient,"um. yeah probably. Tony like 99 to 2020 it was like pretty good coach to hang out my friends and like you know we just like hung out and like it was nice, we were together and like no we didn't do anything really like crazy, it was just like a good like new year's Eve, and I feel like that's like. I don't know sometimes like I think about. And then i'm like okay like. I don't know that was like good and so like just because one was about doesn't mean that we're going to God and like I can I feel like also like I tried to like I. it's not something like that is out of my control, you know, like I it's not like something that's just gonna like i'm going to do all these things like make it good and then it's just like going to turn out bad like."
462.0,Provider,"I don't know yeah it's important to just keep reframing your thoughts, as you said just because last year wasn't good there's. Also, what are you like 20 something there's 20 something other years that I can call upon and maybe a couple of them were bad and the majority of them were good and it's within your control right, what are the things that you can control to make this good."
12971.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah I think this also like I feel like new year's like time was kind of like the peak of like how bad things got last year, so I think that's another reason why because I feel like after this point it kind of like started getting better. Early earliest like started changing for the better, and I think like that's why i'm just like nervous with this because, like I don't know I just feel like. Once I get past this, then I will feel less I, or at least I think i'll feel less anxious, because then there's not as many like. there's not as many like days and left where i'm like oh This reminds me of something that happened last year, around this time so it's kind of like this last like. I don't know like these last days up hopefully if I get through like I won't feel as anxious anymore, and then like I don't know."
462.0,Provider,"yeah so maybe you just kind of walk yourself through these days, let yourself experienced the nerves that come up do your best to reframe it do your best on that day, to give yourself a little bit of alone time space self care and then. As you said just kind of walk yourself through it like Okay, I can show myself, now that this is going to be okay these feelings this response is normal and. Also you're here you're in the moment there's good people around you. you're not in the trauma anymore it's just trying to make you feel like you are right it's just really your mind body kind of playing a trick on you trying to protect you by bringing up the anxiety, so you can just let yourself know i'm safe that's okay I got this and say yeah."
12971.0,Patient,And I feel like also for me like getting ruined like with like trying to get myself through it will like help because I feel like. I don't know it will just like help help me like I think move on from a lot of things like. I feel like i'm. Definitely not like that i'm like okay like you know I can get through the other like you know I can get through that anxiety that I felt like from those past mistakes that I made you know and like try to like keep moving on from not.
462.0,Provider,"Exactly and that's spot on is that if you can show yourself, you can get through this you'll start to just move further and further away from it as long as you don't let yourself. spiral into a complete like trauma response and isolate or something like that you will be able to get through it and start to move further and further away from it, which is, which is the truth so."
12971.0,Patient,So it's like I don't know I think it'll be a relief once. like this weekend so far.
462.0,Provider,"yeah yeah see if you can try to enjoy it as much as possible, or just again keep kind of reminding yourself that it's not last year it's this year and you're going to get through it it's going to start to feel less than less fresh as the years years gone."
12971.0,Patient,"yeah I think I can just like also I feel like try to do like you know, obviously i'm essentially hang out and everything, but like also think about like little things like Oh, I can like pick out a cute outfit like that's something. like that, like, I can spend my time doing you know so like looking at those things, and like thinking about that and be like okay like it'll be fun, you know it'll be like a good, positive experience interesting about like. This is a new year, this is like you know it's not the same, and like I don't know trying to differentiate it."
462.0,Provider,"Definitely trying to find the little things that you enjoy about new year I got cute outfit maybe you have like a favorite drink or a favorite treat you can have on new year's Eve, and just trying to focus on those things."
12971.0,Patient,"That would like help I don't know and, like, I think I mentioned that usually like I write like a letter to myself in the beginning of the year and then I opened at the end, so I actually like looked at my apartment at school, but i'm excited to read that and like see. Where where I am and like I don't even remember what I wrote in it now, so I think it'll be fun, just like see where where I am so."
462.0,Provider,"that's great and a good thing to keep doing so you can write then read the old one right the new one, and maybe see what sticks out to you."
12971.0,Patient,"yeah I think it just helps because I feel like right now, like. I don't know I might think like oh I just like I don't feel like maybe like i've had that much growth or whatever, but then reading the letter usually helps because then I look at like what I wrote and i'm like wow like. i'm like way it's like just a way different situation from like the beginning of the year to the end, or like from this new year, like some for a year, how many things have changed and just like reflecting on that and then also thinking about. You know, in the beginning of the year versus the end and yeah like how much i've actually have grown and like you know done so much and like I don't know like."
462.0,Provider,"yeah absolutely those kinds of things, help they're just the reflection, where you can really see how far you've come rather than just thinking wow last year sucked on scared I don't want to get to that bad place again, but you can see, oh i'm really far away from that."
12971.0,Patient,"yeah exactly I think yeah it was just certainly as like a good like reminder and then they also even. So i'm not as hard on myself say like how the tendency to be really hard on myself i'm like oh like you know just fixating on what's. wrong, and I think we talked about this in group but. It was just like thinking about you know you're always it's like if you get. A like 90 on a test you're thinking like why didn't I get 100 so it's just like always focusing on not like negative thing, and I think that sometimes i'm like guilty that especially like you know thinking about. Like being in the year and i'm like Oh well, I did all these things, and like I made all these mistakes, but it's like okay for the majority of the rest of the year, like I did it. So maybe like I could focus on that, instead of the like bad, so I think just switching like my mindset and trying to like think about it in a more positive way."
462.0,Provider,Definitely and giving again just going back to that giving yourself a grace like sometimes it's okay to be annoyed at your family that's more than okay right. space to just. not always have things be perfect are in control.
12971.0,Patient,"yeah I think I feel like i've gotten a fault, like a gone far and like try not me he's like like in high school when I was younger like I really like struggled with like the wanting the control and like you know. Wanting everything to kind of this perfect oneness, but I think as i've gotten older i've definitely learned like things are not perfect and like I will never be perfect, which is like good, I think. This is gonna sound like a really randomly example but usually so like in high school I like in my room there could just like not be anything that was like. out of place, like everything kind of a spa or whatever, and now like, I feel like i'm not like that as much so, in my room like i'll have like different. Like a basket were just like how's random things like when I was in high school I couldn't even do that, like have something where it's like. Even if it's put away like if it was random or like not organized like that would really bother me, but now I feel like i've like work to be less I don't know like particular in like less controlling of every single thing in my."
462.0,Provider,"And that's good, because that is just a direct response from you trying to feeling out of control, somewhere else and trying to control it through like an inanimate object and ultimately that. can feel good in the moment but it doesn't really lead to much solution of the problem, so maybe that's a good kind of overarching theme and goal but it's just like let some things not be in control."
12971.0,Patient,"yeah yeah that's like what i've been trying to do like more so, like again with my room or like you know not really worried about like okay something's out of place, not that big of a deal or. I don't know I feel like I do it in other. Situations to really just trying to like be no no i'll have to like control every situation you're in like if something doesn't go like, how will you think or whatever like that's fine. And I think also something that I used to be nervous about is like doing new so like going into like if I was going into like a new. arena like sandwich shop like if I was alone I would feel like totally fine doing it, but I thought was like with somebody else like I just feel like more anxious I don't know like. I feel more nervous to see somebody else like basically. Look see me vulnerable in like something I haven't done so, like that's kind of like a. Good another controlling thing like I would rather like go the week before we went go by myself and then."
462.0,Provider,"survey the situation yeah, so I think that's like something else i've been trying to work on to and like."
12971.0,Patient,The controlling aspect of.
462.0,Provider,yeah so maybe you challenge yourself to have your boyfriend take you somewhere where you don't even know where you're going and it's like something he knows you've not done or are good at or don't know about new kind of food or activity that could be a good challenge.
12971.0,Patient,"yeah and, like, I think, for me, so one thing we're moving away from her different is he, like grew up playing sports and all that all like all the time and I didn't so like switch makes me feel a little like. makes me feel nervous because it brings up that feeling of not feeling good enough, and then I just don't want and it's something that again like I just don't have experience, and so I feel like i'm extra critical myself about. Sure, so um that's something I think that I feel like if you know we go and do something like that it'll help because, like. I think, like a few weeks ago we actually like we ended up playing basketball, and he was like teach me how to like shoot about right. which was like and I feel like. Sometimes, like, I would just. make myself feel really tense so like it just ruins the experience, but this time I was like you know what like, let me just like enjoy and like it's not like he's only make fun of me like our own not that good so it's like you know letting go of that like. Pressure that I put on myself really helped us and I just enjoyed it, it was just fun, so I don't know."
462.0,Provider,Good and that brings me back to the idea of the swimming lessons to do you know when those become available.
12971.0,Patient,"yeah so I looked into it and i'm don't think they're available for winter, but i'm pretty sure they are for spring so seeing images contacting someone from like the I think it's like. I think it's like our school like Jim that like. handles on manages it, so the i'm just gonna reach out to them, so, then I can like know exactly like when to register because i'm pretty sure they fill up really fast So even if they're not until spring like I rather know ahead of time, because I think you have to be on it."
462.0,Provider,"yeah. great idea so just keep following up on that and then just kind of go into it, with the same attitude of like you playfulness rather than perfectionism or control."
12971.0,Patient,yeah the.
462.0,Provider,"Water is really a good thing for that, because you really can't fight it you kind of have to let it let go of control and kind of let the water take you if you will."
12971.0,Patient,"yeah no def I think yeah I don't know I think that's what scares me about it is like. Losing that control that I have an especially with something like I don't know that i've been like scared of our nervous. But you know, even now, like me, my friend structure like Oh, maybe we'll do like a Grad trip like after in the summer and stuff and i'm like well I need to learn how to swim better because, like what if we go to somewhere and like you know I want people to enjoy it and so. I also like helps me like have that goal of like trying to overcome in like I don't know just figure it out, and I think also like. yeah I don't know I think I just need to like. Once i'm I think it'll make me feel better that like i'm with like an instructor and like you know they can just like I think it helps and also aims awesome questions and whatever and like. Also, you know my one of my roommate's she mentioned she like used to do swim lessons and stuff and like. She was like you know ice teach like adults who like didn't know how to swim at all and stuff she's and she was like you know it's definitely possible like they would literally be able to like swim and everything like by the end of it, you know so. don't feel like just because you're older like you can't do it, you know, so I can. Definitely not helps like seeing because I think i'm not sure like how this one lessons work for. through school like if they're private or if they're like group, but like I think that'll help us it's like being surrounded by other people that like are doing it to will like just like be nice."
462.0,Provider,yeah that's great so that's that's a good goal that just kind of goes in line with the bigger and broader theme so with just going to everything we've talked about in mind how would you summarize your goals for the next month or so.
12971.0,Patient,"um. I think one would be again just like game since i'm like still home for a little bit and like whatever i'll you know we say so, I spoke my sister all the time, so like just being conscious about like that, and like again like. Why, I feel annoyed I just again I didn't we talk like witnessing like why I feel certain ways and. Now, so I think doing that and then also just like. getting through the next two days and then like reflecting on afterwards and, probably, I mean, I feel, like most likely it's going to be fine, so I think, just like thinking about that, and like. I don't know trying to. not feel like again like not focus on the negative parts of things as much like focus on like the positives more and like change mindset when I do notice myself thinking about it more negatively. yeah I think like that's yeah. And like again just like keeping on like. Taking time for myself, you know through. say anything, especially with the quarter starting like I said, I think this will be like a difficult quarter. So, making sure I think i'm taking time for myself, because I know i'm gonna like otherwise just be you know, like dying with like homework and stuff So hopefully, just like taking time for myself and like establishing that routine like from the beginning of the quarter."
462.0,Provider,"yeah absolutely those that's a perfect list of goals and it kind of goes in line with some smaller things you want to work on, as well as the broader themes so okay yeah that's good stuff um how about we schedule you for January yeah. All right, can you do Thursday January 13."
12971.0,Patient,Yes.
462.0,Provider,Could you do to 30.
12971.0,Patient,yeah 230 works.
462.0,Provider,And then maybe Thursday the 27th same time to 30.
12971.0,Patient,The 27th. Okay yeah that works.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so we'll go to 30 those two Thursdays. you've got some good goals and things to work on, and you know I just hope you can find some enjoyment of the New Year celebration tomorrow and the next day I know it's really hard when you've got the. bad memory of last year feeling kind of close and fresh, but you can start to step away from it and just try to enjoy the little things yeah."
12971.0,Patient,"yeah no i'm I think it'll be good, hopefully, so thank you."
462.0,Provider,"All right, well have a happy New Year, and I will see you next time."
12971.0,Patient,yeah YouTube I have a.
462.0,Provider,"Good wonder thanks. Okay, can you please note in her plan section January goals and list the things that she described there at the end, thank you."
