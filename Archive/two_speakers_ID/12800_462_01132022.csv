462.0,Provider,Good.
12800.0,Patient,"yeah great and what was it Oh, I am followed up with some of the Ritalin thing. So. I don't know what we talked about last week but i'm. married tried to prescribe me some Ritalin. Instead of violence. Which is great, but going to the pharmacy. have the same problem. They said yes, they said it's like the insurance won't cover it and they need permission from you know, like a doctor or a pharmacist, or what do you call it."
462.0,Provider,prescriber.
12800.0,Patient,Right right right.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so."
12800.0,Patient,I just emailed Mary yesterday just. pretty much saying the same thing. For vibrance and then so that's that's that's what happened there.
462.0,Provider,Oh that's so frustrating like how do they think you got the prescription obviously from a prescriber so.
12800.0,Patient,yeah I don't know.
462.0,Provider,"that's really just that's frustrating okay so good job following up with Mary because that's, the best thing you could have done as she gotten back to you, yet."
12800.0,Patient,not yet. Just be waiting on that.
462.0,Provider,"So good job following up and then just getting with Mary I know that's really frustrating so. Hopefully she will respond to you soon and also i'll just i'll reach out to her periodically just to follow up on what's going on, so I can reach out to her as well. Because it's just time to get this solved and get this going with the meds it's just taking a really long time so we'll try to get you these meds as soon as we can."
12800.0,Patient,yeah. yeah that's good. yeah it was a whole issue with like insurance and stuffs now. it's fun times.
462.0,Provider,"yeah yeah no it's not too bad it's just you just have to keep being persistent what you're doing and then like I said I need to keep following up with Mary as well, because now it's just kind of like okay. We did the vibe and they said no okay so here's how about Ritalin know so there's gotta be some middle ground that we can reach here, because obviously the adderall wasn't working so let's we'll try to just keep moving forward."
12800.0,Patient,"mm hmm. Yes, that's like the biggest update. audition for a. Like a. I guess a photoshoot or video gig. This this afternoon So hopefully that goes well. yeah not not too much updated. I want to say let's say. kind of felt, I gave my sister I. Get Christmas guess i'll a Christmas gift. The other the data. You know, ship it to her whatever. and I don't know it was a it was. It was a I don't know it didn't work out it didn't work out sorry kind of like got a little freaked out about it but."
462.0,Provider,wouldn't happen or why didn't it work out.
12800.0,Patient,one. One I. sent it to the wrong apartment number. And so that was kind of. That was that was dumb. And it was kind of like a. Private thing but. yeah it was just a lot of mistakes that I feel like. i'm I made up until that point and. it's kind of shitty I don't know.
462.0,Provider,That is shitty yeah so you tried and it just failed and part of it was mistakes. yeah apartment number.
12800.0,Patient,"yeah there's a wrong apartment number. You know, and it was rushed. It was. It wasn't great but. Fixed it's solved now, but it was still."
462.0,Provider,She get it.
12800.0,Patient,"She got a part of it. So yeah she got a part of it, but. Even the. I think it's it was just the the gift itself was kind of like a dumb. move on my part, but. yeah that was kind of that's kind of lame but. I think it's better now."
462.0,Provider,"What happened with the apartment number, did you just write it down wrong."
12800.0,Patient,"As a long story, I feel like like most of my stories tend to pay but basically she lived at this apartment and she moved a couple of years ago. When she moved literally into like the next apartment over so it's the same apartment complex."
462.0,Provider,But it's like.
12800.0,Patient,"complex and it was pretty. Probably change it, it was. yeah it was like I kind of had almost I felt like I was going to have an anxiety attack, but. Do they happen. yeah also like the neighbor and he wrote her initials. On the baggage. And turns out the person who moved in to that old apartment they have the same initials. it's so it's so fucking crazy it's like."
462.0,Provider,wow.
12800.0,Patient,yeah and it was. yeah and. yeah it was kind of nuts.
462.0,Provider,And I was trying to.
12800.0,Patient,"You know fix it kind of last minute. scramble to get it fixed but. It was. I think it's. Better now I don't know. Okay, but you tried that it just."
462.0,Provider,It was a situation that didn't make you feel very good.
12800.0,Patient,"yeah it was like. yeah it was kind of a disaster. And it was not well thought out, I feel like i've thought about it as oh yeah this is going to be a good gift to give and then, when I really thought about it, I was like no just no that's not as a terrible idea, you know it's like. yeah it's a terrible idea, and it was like a lot of responsibility that I kind of just put on her. You know, and I was like ooh that's kinda know if it was like getting her I don't know like a like an animal or something like a giant. dog or a horse or something it's like what are you gonna do with that. But but yeah I think it's somewhat better now."
462.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, that's good. Do you feel like this is. happens to a lot, where you try to make decisions and it doesn't go how you wanted it to and then you're scrambling."
12800.0,Patient,"yeah you know, I was telling a friend about this. And I kind of had like flashbacks of. When. I wanted to paint the outside of the House I don't know if I told you about that whole fiasco. yeah I didn't get the House painted here's another walk long as store anyways. needed to get that house painted for some reason. This was years ago and. Trying to pick some colors didn't really know what to pick. And one. kind of like schedule everything had like painters kind of like scheduled them call them up got a bunch of quotes and stuff had them come over my schedule the day for them to come over the day before. friends and I, you know we went out. And partied pretty hard next day I didn't really have a. Good grasp, or like what color I really wanted it I kind of I think I did it like I had an idea. And I go to the. Go to the paint department or depot. Literally like at 8am when they open because the painters we're going to come in an hour, so I have like an hour to kind of like know decide on a pink color and I was pretty hung over, and I said Oh, this is yeah this will, this is the color I want it's like this purple color. And you know i'm like trying to talk to the guy. buying a cashier i'm like Oh, is this a good color for a house and it was just like. It was like a teenager who's a team and music yeah yeah it's great okay i'll take like. followed by yeah right, you know i'll take you know $500 worth of that paint. Get the pain and I think the big thing was is that my dad was going to cover it. Because it was his idea to kind of like repaint the House, but he wanted to know what color. It was before I went and got it, but I just did not. is like I didn't even remember let that he told me to do that. It only I only remembered it when I had to make the call that day and I said oh hey the painters are here. You know they're going to do it and then he was like what like. What are you talking about, like you, David told me what pain, it was or what color was. and he's like well what's the paint ID called and because you can look it all up. And I told him it's it's it's called berry blast and it's this this hideous chest I don't know just it looks like a barney color. yeah and. And he's like. Why didn't you call me why don't you tell me that you're going to do this and as. And so yeah so last minute decision and it was a bad one, I rushed into it and it was a yes and now and painters came by and they just did it or they did this years ago and so every day it's this kind of like. Just it's embarrassing really just like a constant reminder of just. Like. My Fuck ups, I feel like. it's just like. I don't know what is appropriate or not, but it's like. yeah it's just it just feel shitty it's like a mark of shame that. And i'm just so embarrassed about it it's just. And it's all kind of like it was all on is really all on me it's like why Why did I you know kind of like. do it that way. yeah it's kind of just. not regret it's definitely a regret, but. learn to live with it, but still it's just like it's an eyesore you know, in the rest of the. I feel is. That community, but the neighborhood you know just like. And that wasn't like my intention at all, and when I looked at my reference photo of what you know what kind of color I wanted a little bit better it was. I don't know is one it wasn't the same color and two is it was like one of worked I guess it would have been a better color but still. So yeah long story short, I kind of felt like that, where I kind of put a lot of. I made a lot of bad decisions in a. short amount of time with little preparedness and. Obviously it's not it's not gonna work out when you know rushing through it. yeah."
462.0,Provider,"I know in hindsight on like either the gift or the House painting Is there something that you think. You could have done differently, that would have helped or changed the situation."
12800.0,Patient,"um. Probably could have slowed down. As we're yeah probably could have slowed down. My decisions leading up to that point probably could have been better. You know, maybe not. party so hard and."
462.0,Provider,"Does this happen often where you feel like being hung over drinking interrupts your ability to function in a way, you want to. Just kind of this example happened to be that was a part of it."
12800.0,Patient,"I think that was one of the exams I don't know if it happens, a lot. yeah nothing happens a lot a lot granted I don't really. Have any you know big responsibilities, right now, but. yeah about probably could have been better. and see. ya know it's um. yeah probably could have thought about it a little bit more, you know I thought it would be a good gift because of other reasons, but you know I didn't think of all the other things that you would need to that comes with. That and putting that on my you know. sister is. Like giving you more work it's like. You know. But yeah."
462.0,Provider,"You can look back and understand, after the situations happen, but it feels kind of like out of control, until the aftermath."
12800.0,Patient,"yeah that's kind of. yeah that's kind of it and. And I think it's. kind of the other yeah I would say so it's like literally having. Just a short amount of time to do. To do everything. yeah and that's kind of maybe that's what. kind of screwed me over. Just kind of rushing through it. But it's hard to know. yeah when i'm given a like a time. As making big decisions and, like in a very. I guess quick amount of time."
462.0,Provider,yeah.
12800.0,Patient,"So. So yeah you know I didn't. beat myself up too much about it about it over it. So maybe cuz things kind of worked out in the end, but."
462.0,Provider,"yeah okay yeah but it's still just kind of reinforcing that pattern that we've talked about right up just a little bit of shame for lack of focus or follow through so we have a little bit less time than usual today i'm filling in a colleagues group at four but. We can keep you know that number one focus right now the meds which you did good following up on and i'll follow up and we'll try to get. get a new MED going so that we can work through that process, and then, what do you, I think, a goal, you said last week was definitely trying to work out more maybe joining like a group fitness something. thoughts on that follow up on that."
12800.0,Patient,"um yeah a little it's kind of crazy, you know going through meetup then some of the things here. Look kind of cool nothing like super solid, but some of my friends randomly decided to do something for a month, and so a lot of them are trying to do a workout too, and so joining that as well. and hopefully that'll be. Giving myself some. Better. I don't know accountability."
462.0,Provider,"yeah. Perfect alright, so we can keep that going any other goal you'd like to accomplish between this week and next."
12800.0,Patient,i'm not specifically now I feel like.
462.0,Provider,yeah that's a good start right there actually. Can you do next Thursday the 20th at 2pm.
12800.0,Patient,yeah.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'll put you in for that, and then we can just keep following up on the meds following up on that group exercise. And maybe you just try to take a little bit of time to think about other instances where you felt like it was that rushed decision and kind of a scramble to. solve the problem after the fact, and just kind of think about how that made you feel if you're still carrying any shame from that or just what could have been done differently."
12800.0,Patient,Okay. sounds good. yeah i'll keep in mind if you said it was two or 230.
462.0,Provider,I forgot to.
12800.0,Patient,Do okay. cool alright thanks Jesse.
462.0,Provider,"Perfect I will see you next week, thank you."
12800.0,Patient,"All right, take care enjoy the weekend. bye bye."
462.0,Provider,"Can you please just follow up on the goals that we just talked about and add the new one that I wanted him to kind of think about the. The other times that he's maybe gone through those rush rush to decisions their shame leftover from that or what could have been done differently, thank you."
