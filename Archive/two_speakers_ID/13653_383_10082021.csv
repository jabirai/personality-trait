383.0,Provider,"i'm pretty well there's a dog barking. Outside quite a bit, so I apologize if that's. Getting loud, or maybe."
13653.0,Patient,you're right but it's okay yeah there's no worries.
383.0,Provider,So. Are you still off of work right now.
13653.0,Patient,"yeah so i'm still off of work and i'm i'm going to be checked again on November 1 This is like. This is kind of disappointing because I mean i'm getting time off, but. turns out I don't like I have a federal. employee, I have a federal position and the. The disability insurance from California does not is. Not given to federal employment, so I don't have like. Any like disability leave pay, I found another one which I completely forgot to call them. To make sure, but I think it only. Matters if I start working."
383.0,Provider,Okay well you mean. You found another another another way.
13653.0,Patient,"Another service for federal employees, but it works like you pay part of your salary and then, I guess, they need to after a while i'm not sure how but. Okay yeah i've actually been not on the ball, so I guess I don't care something or I procrastinate oh no I don't know."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, how are you doing. with other things like tasks of daily living, I think we talked about that now last appointment, just like keeping your room, you know straighten up your room and kind of just attending to daily to do, how are you doing with that."
13653.0,Patient,"My room as a lot Messier than it was my dishes are not done with the sink is disgusting because I haven't done the dishes. My floor is messy but I did take out the trash earlier like an hour ago. And I was thinking about our conversation like we I should tidy things up. yeah I did a bit, but mostly no it's still really messy in here."
383.0,Provider,"Do you think that has a reflection, or that is a reflection of how you're feeling inside."
13653.0,Patient,yeah it could be it's really messed up I have them having more structure in my life like i've been being pretty i've been pretty good going to the gym I go like. Almost every day.
383.0,Provider,Oh good.
13653.0,Patient,"yeah and i'm feeling like. much healthier and I look healthier. And i've also been like attending classes at a university nearby and like I haven't i'm not enrolled, but I just drop in the class and just kind of part to dissipate. audited and that's giving me structure, so I go every day I go to the campus just hanging around there for classes and stuff."
383.0,Provider,"I see is that uc Santa Barbara. And are you able to do that, because your mom as a professor there."
13653.0,Patient,"um well she gave me the idea, but you can anyone can do it all you have to do is appear at the class and make sure you don't cause too much i've seen so they kick you out and then you can kind of slip in and learn on your own."
383.0,Provider,wow so what classes that you've been going to.
13653.0,Patient,"um so i've done history class and. Film class they're both about China. And I was looking to do like a global studies class, but that I missed it yesterday because I wasn't feeling well. yeah it's for me it's pretty nice to be over campus and do something."
383.0,Provider,That sounds that sounds interesting on. How are you doing with taking your medicine and are you taking medication as prescribed or how is that going for you.
13653.0,Patient,"I started to stop taking my zyprexa a couple weeks ago, and then I started seeing like effects come back up like I started acting a little strange and like talking to myself getting a little delusional and over emotional about things. Though I have my. My therapist and the other group kind of caught that and so to the psychiatrists and they're like you really should take your medicine, so I started up again on zyprexa."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, good. that's i'm glad you. notice that yourself and i'm glad that you are also. observed, you know that your psychiatrist observed that and recommended you start back up again. Are you seeing your other your psychiatrist regularly."
13653.0,Patient,yeah I had a zoom session with him earlier today.
383.0,Provider,And are you in the Group same or that he was offering that you're engaged in with us.
13653.0,Patient,I am yeah i'm taking that so.
383.0,Provider,How many groups are you attending through with him.
13653.0,Patient,"um well it's with a another therapist and I attended. For Monday through Thursday I skipped two sessions this week, because I was a little. weird we're just going a little crazy."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, are you, seeing that therapist that runs that group one on one."
13653.0,Patient,"yeah I think it is a requirement to have individual session, so I do have it that's all I have it later tonight."
383.0,Provider,"Okay okay good, and this is is this based out of Santa Barbara. Yes, okay. So is this group affiliated with a psychiatrist is it all sort of like is it an affiliation, the group and the psychiatrist."
13653.0,Patient,yeah. started LCD. was the one who.
383.0,Provider,What was that.
13653.0,Patient,"Sorry, LSD is the one who founded the group and created this program."
383.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay well you know if you're being seen individually by the therapist that you're in group with with them and then you have your psychiatrist with them, it sounds like that's kind of. You know. A good a good fit i'm not saying that you know it's not a good fit for you to do with my heart, health, but it sounds a little more intensive. You have groups, you know, during the week and you have. Also, individual therapy with the woman slated part of the group, and then your psychiatrist is connected to that i'm just wondering if you might maybe just might want to focus on that treatment program for your ongoing mental health care."
13653.0,Patient,"That was also thinking about that. um. I was thinking, though the after I finished it I won't have a therapist and then I was wondering what I would do after that."
383.0,Provider,"um. Well, how long is it going. I thought you had finished it, I was under the impression you were finishing up, but it seems like it's continuing on."
13653.0,Patient,yeah just it got extended a couple more weeks I think i'll finish around November and then no. need another therapist so Would I be able to come back to bite.
383.0,Provider,"us definitely you could um. I yeah I mean you can do for sure um. i'm just i'm wondering if there may be going to keep it, you know going to if there's an option for you to extend with them. Just if it seems like you need that. But I mean we're always here if you're how the work individually with the therapist that you're already just start, starting with the the individual work."
13653.0,Patient,"it's um it's helpful yeah we do like we go through. Certain thoughts I just bring up thoughts and then she will question me and we'll try to break it down into. different categories using CBD and DDT. And it's helpful because I get to say it out loud and then she'll provide feedback in her opinion and, like."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, good. So. How do you feel like. This therapy is different for you or or how is this the work we've done helpful or."
13653.0,Patient,"It is also helpful that yeah you're right that it might be a little much and then, if I focused on just the program it would. be better and the, as I have on for like i've missed a lot of sessions with you just because i've completely forgotten that they were there, so I just. So i'm thinking yeah you're you're right like I already have a lot of therapy, maybe like just me like telling myself like. This is too much or something. But it's it has been helpful to talk with you."
383.0,Provider,"yeah um. Well, I think all the support you can get is great, but typically it's recommended, you know you worked with one organization group therapists and psychiatrists and you, you know it seems like the communication is fluid there. And then you know once that's complete, then you can you know go to another program it seems like that's a more intensive outpatient program which I think is really great I think that's what you need. So you've got ongoing groups through the week and you see the psychiatrist and they're helping you, with your medication and then you've got one on one therapy so we're here, if you want to return. But I can put in a request to discharge you, for the moment and or. i'll just have to consult a bit with my supervisor if if we can just sort of put you on hold, I don't know if that's possible or not, but. It might be good i'll have to consult and i'll have someone get back to you about that."
13653.0,Patient,Sure yeah I agree yeah.
383.0,Provider,"and tell me, so I just wanted to make sure that I. I know that we had the release, but the entire program is through your your doctor your psychiatrist right."
13653.0,Patient,I believe so.
383.0,Provider,"So the groups are also me just see here or. Dr Sharif Ls. T. And so the groups are a part of. As a practice. And you're an individual weekly through his practice, you see an individual therapist weekly. Okay. And how many groups are you in."
13653.0,Patient,"A week or four groups, a week."
383.0,Provider,For and how long are they.
13653.0,Patient,Three hours OK.
383.0,Provider,OK so i'm going to send a message to my supervisor and just have her get back to me about you know whether or not you're going to go into the discharge lane or. kind of be put on hold and then we will send you an email about that. And even if you are discharged you can still come back that's not that doesn't mean any I mean it just means that we kind of close close out your current admission and then we admit you when you come back.
13653.0,Patient,Okay.
383.0,Provider,Did you want to talk about anything else during this appointment or.
13653.0,Patient,"yeah what is well. Specifically. Oh, I am feeling better but kind of unsure what my next. Move is i've kind of accepted my my next step in life, which is to. Go study Chinese in Taiwan, which would be a great experience but. What I do with that is really unclear. And I feel like i'll have a hard time finding a job after I finish so that's. i'm not worried about it, yet, but it's just like God my mind like what what do I do. i'm see. It was. Just seems like I don't know what to do next, and. I have spent a long time in my parents house. And a lot of that was by Decision actually because I had the. enough money from my job to move out but I decided not to and. i'm kind of concerned about why I did that, and then it kind of works out because I went I suddenly needed and very a lot of. therapy so. It harder to get if I was out in the world, on my own I don't know if I can handle that. yeah."
383.0,Provider,"well. you've been through a lot these last this chunk of bit of time when you've been you know when well there's the pandemic, you know and then there's kind of how everybody was shut down and maybe how that impacted you, in addition to the doubts about. Whether you were had fault follow the right. course of study of math and so forth. and So I think that do you have a shame around or feeling like Oh, you know living at home, do you feel embarrassed about that, or do you feel kind of. Like you should be doing something else besides living at your parents house."
13653.0,Patient,I definitely feel like I should have. And I do feel a bit ashamed about it. that's yeah that's pretty correct that's.
383.0,Provider,"Okay um. well. I mean it is. Common that your age after you get a college you think that your life should look like a certain thing. You know, you should be on your own you should be in your own apartment and have a job and if you're not then you're kind of failing and there. it's it's actually rather more common than not, I think it's quite common that people are doing those things, you know that they live with their parents for a while, maybe they're. Having roommates for a while, maybe then that doesn't go well, and they go back to living with their parents and because it's actually rather hugely challenging can be hugely challenging to live establish yourself on your own and and so. it's normal in a sense, to be in this state of. Transition or flux or. From my perspective, it's it's it's rather normal it's not, but I think, from your perspective if you can kind of give yourself leeway. With in that regard, because your parents actually are being at your at your parents House has been it's a great cushion, especially when you're going through hard you know mental health challenges, and I mean it's it's it's a wonderful. it's. good fortune that you are able to be there. And so kind of just reminding yourself. Okay, actually, this is this is good fortune and it takes time to establish. independence and all of that there's a lot that goes into that you know, even if you were in your own apartment and you could pay the rent you might really feel out of sorts or. You know, not be able to manage that kind of independence. Day in and day out."
13653.0,Patient,"there definitely adds to it and. yeah it turned out to be beneficial and a lot of ways. it's easy to forget that or it's. yeah I often overlook. The things I do have going for me and take them for granted and that's what my friend full name like I don't know my old roommate in college he We talked to the guy he's like yeah man, you should be more grateful about what you have like I wish I had what you. Say yeah that's something I forgot."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm well was he sang about. Life for him when his.
13653.0,Patient,"His life is going better now, but before, when we talk. He was still searching for a job living at home and he's he's also older than me. is stressing about getting like health insurance benefits and things and. yeah he's like man i'm jealous of you, you got the job. You got health insurance for your mom like you're young like don't like just be grateful, but now he's got it he's got a job which is awesome."
383.0,Provider,So. It seemed like anxiety was a big big part of. what's been. troubling you.
13653.0,Patient,"yeah part of it was. Like sort of like a competition like I was seeing people around me in college or like I put myself in a place in college, where people were better than me. And then I just got so used to these people being better than me and constantly trying to outdo them and failing failing at it just. God. Just kept damaging my self confidence and. And it took its toll mentally on me to constantly do."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm you're not you're coming up short in your own mind your own estimation you're coming up short.
13653.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I just looked at everything I had and just said, every single thing is not good enough when I if I had like accepted like where I was and I probably would have even done better because I wouldn't have been a. stressor being so negative and push putting myself down because I was like extra energy. Like every situation like. it's like I don't have enough friends, I don't like I went to a college that's not good enough and just. You know i'm not like talking to like these hot girls, like my grades aren't good enough and just i'm not i'm stupid like i'm not good enough at this thing that I obviously am not going to. just keep kept pushing down just because I thought, like being that hard on myself would push me further but it actually ended up. damaging me and I have to like do it all yeah."
383.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. So much stress you put on yourself. yeah, so I think that the work you're doing with the therapist to look at those thoughts, you know sort of one by one. And and deconstruct them. Do you feel like you are. able to be a little gentler with yourself."
13653.0,Patient,"I definitely am no yeah i'm able to do it, but it could come back I could easily see it coming back, I still do it compare myself with other people. Do these people. But. I do catch myself a little bit more and i'm little. uh huh yeah okay like that's not gonna happen it's chill out man and. it's helpful it's a little slower than I wanted to but. Like going to the gym helps a lot with my. perception of how quickly things progress, because when I go to the gym I see people like lifting weights way more than me they look like more muscular me like. uh huh and then i'm I look at myself i'm like yeah like yeah this is going to take time it's just just do it it's like it's more and more you do it, then you push yourself to the extreme, each time because it's not possible. yeah it's like yeah this is healthy, because I am making progress, you didn't you started like to I don't remember two or three weeks ago, why are you being so hard it doesn't make any sense so."
383.0,Provider,"So two or three weeks ago you started at the gym and. And, did you notice oh such and such activity, whether it was lifting weights, or I don't know what what what you're doing physically but you're at a different place now than you were then. Like you're you feel some some increased strength, or is it is it do you feel it building gradually."
13653.0,Patient,yeah yeah I think i've made pretty good progress.
383.0,Provider,"But but it's it's slow, it takes time, as you mentioned."
13653.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
383.0,Provider,"Okay. yeah. It also seems like. there's a mindset at the stage for you that you are it's linear like life is linear you're you're you're here and then you're you are going to be moving forward, and you have this various things that you need to accomplish and that's what your life is about. accomplishing."
13653.0,Patient,and moving.
383.0,Provider,forward.
13653.0,Patient,"mm hmm it feels like my mind right now is like. Where I have to work in my 20th so then my 30s I can actually do something and i'm not going to have as much energy in my 30s so i'm like. Being That was why I was being so hard on myself for part of reason and I know that doesn't exactly work that way, but you do change right at 30 like your memory is not as strong anymore i'm not sure, but that's how I am viewing it right now, from."
383.0,Provider,yeah but the way you've been viewing it is what you're describing is that life is kind of like.
13653.0,Patient,it's just this.
383.0,Provider,"Continual it's basically going down because if you're like from what you're saying you. Like if you don't do stuff now you're going it's going it's pretty much all downhill from here, young now and you're just going to get older so what's going to happen, you know you better you better get on the treadmill you know."
13653.0,Patient,yeah that's how.
383.0,Provider,Now is the only time to do it.
13653.0,Patient,yeah I don't know that's definitely not healthy to think that way.
383.0,Provider,"Well it's very much like it's a very driven driven by. What is like what the heck's not going to work out type of thing because, basically, things are you know my concentration is going to get weaker my physical self is going to get weaker. it's not a perspective that is. shows an unfolding of. interesting experiences and possible ups and downs and it's sort of all going one way and that's kind of. Maybe maybe up, but maybe frequent you know partially down to but but life is. it's it's an unfolding of experiences so you'll have some experiences that are very interesting and. lovely and then you'll have hard times and then you'll have some other experiences that are cool and great, and you know I mean this this is from my side, which is now you decades older than you and I can say that you know. worry and anxiety and fear is a lot of wasted energy because. Because you know. What do you have to fear you're here to live your life you're going to do the best you can some times it's going to go well, and your favor and sometimes there's going to be hard times and. You do the best you can and there's they're hard things around the corner that you, you that are going to be difficult and there's cool things around the corner that you don't know about. Like let's say you had a child, you know what you feel for that child or what your experience of is of seeing that child just be human you know in front of you is could be like the most miraculous experience and so to incredibly beautiful thing that's not something we can quantify. So I guess it's this quantification it seems like this is your perspective is related to a measurement and and can you know."
13653.0,Patient,"Right right yeah i'm. yeah i'm still having this mindset that i'm behind the behind. Keep camp for drive forward and it's it is over, simplifying. My experience of life I have very psychic narrowing yeah it's like putting blinders on."
383.0,Provider,"So this thing of your being behind this thought that i'm behind. You know I think back to like let's look at one of your thoughts, you know okay that's one of the thoughts it's already always there you know, often there POPs in i'm behind. well. Well, first of all that thought is a negative thought it's a thought that it's putting you down, you know you're not. you're not in front of your behind. So you've got to work harder do more to even maybe get even equal to. So that's going to bring stress. But again it's. it's relative to whatever measurement you have decided to place on what life is supposed to be at your age."
13653.0,Patient,"yeah and my expectations, I know they're really unrealistic but it's like I have this thing like if I make unrealistic expectations i'll try much harder and in with all the math stuff like that definitely made me very upset and unhappy."
383.0,Provider,When you had high expectations of yourself and in your math studies.
13653.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I tried. I shouldn't have done like that was a revelation I had earlier these months and I couldn't get over it was very hard for me to like process it took a month or two to to really kind of accepted and. Like I noticed it in college like I just I don't know what's going on, compared to these other people and, and I should have. done other things so. But it's done. And it's there's some upsides to it, but it is a bit embarrassing to have this math degree and then have to say, like. Oh, I don't know what's going on. So that sucks but yeah I haven't done and out of that and I think i've moved past it."
383.0,Provider,"hey guys good. i'm glad you're you're processing that you're getting more understanding about it, and that when you're in the middle of it, you didn't you know, in a way didn't listen to yourself. That you weren't happy and you weren't getting it and you just wasn't the right place to be. I mean to me that might have, what is the lesson for you and that."
13653.0,Patient,"that's a good one um. it's kind of like. My step dad so this to me like you got to pick your battles and I was trying to battle a losing losing war like I was failing, I was struggling and like no I insist, I insist that I keep going. So I notice that now, when I still get in that mindset where like I failed and i'm failing over and over again. And then my insistence, to keep going just to prove myself is unhealthy and it's really damaging not just to myself to other people so it's a to. recognize when that happens, and just like Okay, can I, maybe I should try a different approach and or switch to something else you know."
383.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah. yeah it's like. Being this is simplification, but like going to a restaurant sitting down and just realizing, this is not where you want to be you don't want to be. Here you don't want to be in this place and maybe you've already ordered you know it's just like we always have a choice you know, is always have a choice to say oh I changed my mind, you can you always do have that option to change your mind. And you may disappoint people, you may. You may disappoint. Whoever but if that's what you feel you know what this is not feeling right I just don't want this. You can change your mind and. and make a different choice. You know, we do want to recognize when we're being fickle but that's where not having not we're not talking about that we're talking about just what you're saying like recognizing that this isn't. This isn't working for me. yeah. So. you're going to study, possibly going to study Chinese. And you don't you mentioned you're worried about finding a job when you're finished, but again that's something you that's kind of like when we worry about the future, we just bring on that worry that stress of worry into your consciousness. And there's nothing we can only live in the present you know you can't reach into the future and and see if you can tinker around in the future and create a job for yourself you're just where you are right now. And you can do the best planning that you can to. Study something that you think is interesting to you, and that you can. do well, and then you'll take the next thing when you, you know when is the next step. You can only step up onto the steps that where you're at."
13653.0,Patient,yeah. yeah. um. there's also a problem of coming back or. yeah coming down to reality and like it's still I still have my head's in the cloud about all these grand things and then realistically like i'm still. Not there and. i'm hard to get out of that mindset.
383.0,Provider,"Well, I think you can have dreams, you can have. Like if you had a big blackboard you know, in your room and you could write on it, you know what are your dreams. And if there was like a filmmaker I don't know i'm just this is all hypothetical, but if you have a. Chinese filmmaker that is does super cool stuff that you'd like to learn from and maybe work near you could you can put that on your list of dreams. And workout you know we thinks dreams take work that's the thing so."
13653.0,Patient,"I have like a fear of. Pursuing something and then like have a goal pursue it and then not being able to get the goal like that, and that makes me very fearful of even trying to do, the thing."
383.0,Provider,"yeah. well. Part of this is wrapped up in what we're just talking about earlier. Is. Your anxiety around. Your performance and if you're able to. Do the thing and. and Again, you know dreams take work so. And they do take perseverance, sometimes as well."
13653.0,Patient,They do.
383.0,Provider,"Can can you persevere. and calm your your anxieties down and and look for strategy is. You see, because anxiety does that help you strategize or try to problem solve or clearly see. Some maybe I need to do it more this way. That takes a calm state of mind to. analyze a problem and then go about solving it or. How am I going to pursue this dream, you know what's what are my next steps i'm going to you know five phone calls I need to make all of that takes a calm. Clear mind. When you're anxious and fearful you don't have a calm clear mind, and so you it impacts are your cognitive ability to address. A problem that's at hand. that's what's really, really important that you. I think of you, and everyone. deal with your fears, you know. deal with your anxiety learn how to calm your nervous system down down learn how to cook coach coach yourself. Practice learn to practice meditation and relaxation techniques to calm yourself down. so that you can see things more clearly and make. You know the best choice that you can make."
13653.0,Patient,"Definitely. um. But on on the on anxiety anxiety it's there and it does like. motivate you right out of fear. that something will happen, but it's not a sustainable motivation it's like animal instinct to get you out of trouble."
383.0,Provider,"mm hmm. yeah. I think that, for instance, if you're afraid that you can't pay your rent to that. That pushes you to go out and get a job."
13653.0,Patient,There is help there but. But it's like I need this one thing it's like deer in the headlights.
383.0,Provider,"But there's other ways of of just knowing that. This is a responsibility, and I must, you know I need my responsibilities so i'm going to. do everything I can to seek employment, because this is a responsibility. So matter could be. That could be a perspective as well you know you're just assuming your adult responsibilities, not that there's tear around the corner, you know word. I think I think, as a young person, there is, you know I want to validate your fears, you know there's fears about you know, is this. Is this life going to work out for me and my you know, can I do this, you know this is kind of scary. Those are real invalid fears because life is challenging and it is. Hard you know it is tough. But also, you know, having faith in yourself and also recognizing your. Like your friend was saying, you know all the things you have in your corner, you know you've got a family you've got education and your family got some you know stability in your family, these are things to go wow you know there's a lot of stability behind me actually. And and breathe into that you know. And just go Okay, you know, actually, you know i'm not in a pretty good place and and actually a very good place compared to other people."
13653.0,Patient,"hmm i've noticed that actually like that made me feel very guilty and in college. Because my I didn't worry at all about tuition it just I just it was like I was going to a summer camp and just like all right off I go and we didn't talk about fafsa. I didn't talk about fafsa with my parents I didn't even know how much we're paying each semester I just went and I took it for for granted and that made me feel very guilty, because people around me were like. yeah I gotta pay off my loan I gotta do this I just didn't bring it up, because I was so embarrassed is like. I would say, like yeah my parents are paid everything for me and then like they would like I was thinking like Oh, they would hate me i'm just some spoiled kid and like one time, like, I went to like this. group meaning for like a club, where they like they like pick you out like it's like a hiring process I guess. Like it was like what did you do over the summer, and it was like Oh, I went to Germany and I just hung out and I traveled throughout the entire summer and, like the girl, just like. She just like when oh. She became like very. spoiled kid there."
383.0,Provider,was someone that was interviewing you or.
13653.0,Patient,"just another interview he, like we're it was like it was like group activity somewhere like getting a circle."
383.0,Provider,"And my God, what did I see."
13653.0,Patient,"So i'm very privileged yeah and it took a while to. know that yeah that like when I went to college. I didn't expose myself enough to different kinds of people and learn more about why they're doing things why they chose their major where they're coming from I didn't learn much about that I was way too focused on myself, and I was kind of depressed but I kind of use that to. To avoid learning it's made me feel guilty."
383.0,Provider,"Well, I think you're very aware of many, many things, and you know you want to do the right thing and you're. You know you're aware of your privilege, I think that guilt doesn't serve anyone, you know. If you didn't you know. twist someone's arm to be privileged just happened just that's just like you know just you just were born into that and so. I think that you know you being guilt feeling guilty about it is a waste of your privilege, in a sense, a waste of your energy. You have a you have some gifts in your corner and you have some you have some strengths in your corner because of that, and so therefore not not for guilt just just to to relax into that it's okay. take a deep breath try to not compare yourself to other people and just get to know them and and then know that you do have some strength in your corner that you didn't you know. You didn't rob a bank to get that those strengths, they just they just sit there because, and so you know, I think that gratefulness that gratitude is really. That is very helpful because if you have gratitude, then you don't, then you say I recognize these gifts and I don't take them for granted, I recognize them and and i'm going to. You know just. say thank you to the universe or or or your parents or your good fortune and and and and not feel guilty about it and just step forward with you know. With what you have to try to do the right thing, without fear comparison. and And just taking things one one step at a time."
13653.0,Patient,Okay. that's. So cool. think that way yeah instead of thinking of these negative emotions as a waste of time will be helpful to. think positively.
