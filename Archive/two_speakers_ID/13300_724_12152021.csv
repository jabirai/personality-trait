13300.0,Patient,Oh yeah I. heard that. I H s s. yeah.
724.0,Provider,Good. So the shot did nothing for you.
13300.0,Patient,"is able, you see mikey we're all right today will say yeah but you told me to shut me up something. Right and you said stay in the bed, the whole day somebody to watch over me the whole day don't get up walk around. But it didn't do too much didn't do anything really like my back that worse, but if she tells me therapy i'm just going to tell my doctor just to refer me to some other people cuz I saw a doctor wants to do it, just as permitted therapy and I therapy makes it worse."
724.0,Provider,"yeah. They had was. there's almost like a like a blueprint for for treatment when it comes to like chronic pain, sometimes. And it's like you know the initial step is like go to your primary doctor and you're like hey this hurts and they're like okay so we're going to do an extra and you're like nothing's broken. Their stuff and it's like i'd even ever either like nope we're going to do the X Ray first and then you'll do the X Ray and then it's like oh."
13300.0,Patient,that's why they proceeded. It is something wrong with my back end stuff but. nerve it's up some of those things are stuck together those T whatever whatever and in my neck.
724.0,Provider,So your discs.
13300.0,Patient,They sent me they had me do a test on my arm and the doctor said that I had chronic.
724.0,Provider,neuropathy.
13300.0,Patient,know in aren't we type too much or.
724.0,Provider,Whole bottle.
13300.0,Patient,"carpal tunnel, though I went to the doctors that are referred to, or yet couple times X X Ray and this already, but he said there that was it and he said he thinks it's my neck and is my neck I did MRI and everything else is I got some other ones here I got it. Right. yeah right."
724.0,Provider,So yeah the the neck is going to have nerve endings that are going to attach to and function for a lot of the upper body. You have like your thoracic spine so cervical spine is like the first seven I think in the neck down.
13300.0,Patient,yeah I got those.
724.0,Provider,"You know thoracic and then lumbar so like your spines and like three sections and. Our is all like from here, as far as nervous go right and then obviously. The next section is going to cover this area and the next section, the lower lumbar is going to cover. All the nerves going down into your legs and stuff like that so that's what like what you have a psychiatric issue that like runs on the back here right die, you know, through your through your body down your leg."
13300.0,Patient,stuff like that yeah and. Then it. also appears in the teeth.
724.0,Provider,yeah yeah thoracic yeah. yeah no so you probably got pinched nerves dude a bulging disc so what happens.
13300.0,Patient,I forgot about that.
724.0,Provider,"So what happens is like. Again, between the board there's like a like a jelly doughnut."
13300.0,Patient,And that's your day so it's like oh my.
724.0,Provider,"God oh yeah. yeah so when it pushes down it squeezes on that this and a disc will shoot out like like fluid. And then that fluid gets hard and the fluid will sit on nerve endings and essentially like like caught off circulation, to the nerve endings. So the idea is that you want like decompression that's why like I had like a neck injury guide a couple bulging disc my my cervical spine, and it causes all kinds of dirt permanent nerve."
13300.0,Patient,damage is really getting bad. yep and the legs.
724.0,Provider,"yep so you got to do like like decompression stuff where like I had this device where it stuck my neck into it and I had a rope. right and it would go in with attached to a door and then like a like a drawstrings Pole and I would pull it and it would like. A log eat my neck, and it would just give me pressure, and I would have to do that, like over time to kind of get the disks or to try to get the bones off the disk to allow that fluid to suck back into the. arm and you gotta catch it early so like like a lot of like i'll give you, you know pull your chat all the way and kind of like force it down, you could feel. yeah you're spot yeah so. yeah little. Little physical therapy thing is is watching."
13300.0,Patient,This video.
724.0,Provider,Right now write as much as the peace.
13300.0,Patient,of God is.
724.0,Provider,PT stuff sucks you know what I mean because we want like you know we want.
13300.0,Patient,But I had before. But thank thing i've added on my back already she sent me there yeah. i'm going twice again she sent me for my back already.
724.0,Provider,"yeah it's it's chronic pain it's just product being the term means that you're going to have to keep dealing with it's it's a pain it's a real pain physically it's a pain, you know mentally you know, like a lot of times we. were dealing with chronic pain it occupies so much space in our in our brain and our energy that like it zappos of like freedom to a certain degree. And it's hard to deal with, sometimes, because obviously there it's always existing it's always there always. By sit here for too long, how am I going to feel when I get up or you know you've been here like Oh, I definitely did something there so you're you're consciously always very aware of how your body is position and how you. My space it's very frustrating and for people that don't have chronic pain like like they're lucky, they just haven't developed it yet. It does wear you down it's very stressful very, very stressful. So so after this he's gonna try to send you back to PT and I had to tell you something else, and then potentially send you off to. You by the end of the other one was the last time you had an MRI."
13300.0,Patient,I had Mr Ryder determines this. That was this this year. For my neck and then went from my. My back.
724.0,Provider,Okay.
13300.0,Patient,Now yeah.
724.0,Provider,"yeah so yeah I mean they'll they'll probably send you to physical therapy and then the next resolvable. direction it's like it's surgical, and I mean that's traditionally what they do."
13300.0,Patient,"Well, I guess i'll take another shot just long as a stronger shot that never heard of light again shots."
724.0,Provider,yep I did a cortisone shot and to my spine and. That sought.
13300.0,Patient,Like like when they did yeah talking about epidural.
724.0,Provider,"You know what it was yeah that's what it was they had an epidural into I cervical spine and the door was time it was cortisone is what they shot into, but they do an epidural later so it's like. You know it wasn't fun it wasn't. But what happens is like the cortisone gets in there and it kind of loosens up all the inflammation that allows the the joints to kind of get back to where they need to be. So i'd be i'd get some relief, you know what I mean like the alternative to that in my situation was like you can either do this shot. And do PT and hope that it gets better or we're going to go in and do a surgical procedure where they're going to cut the discount you know put a space for it and you know. And infuse it, you know put screws it and that's a wrap and then you turn around like like a superhero for the rest of your life, where you're like this right, so I was like I don't I don't want to do that going through my neck and then do the procedure, and it was like a you know."
13300.0,Patient,"No, I don't want that either."
724.0,Provider,yeah so.
13300.0,Patient,I sure don't want to do. With that.
724.0,Provider,"Right so like I I always advocate obviously you know, like surgeons, you know every surgeon, you talk to you, they want to cut you open that's what they do you know every physical therapist so you talk to you, they want to do PT so it's like. When you get the information you got to take as much of it that you can. do some critical thinking on your own and then turn what the best outcome for you is not necessarily what they're telling you so it's like. surgeries appropriate you know, every time I I talked to a surgeon before I looked at physical therapy, he was like yeah. i'll cut you off, but i'll do all this stuff and I was like, can I just go to PT first a chiropractor maybe you know see if we can kind of work it out, because I was like still young and I was like you know mid 30s I was like I don't want to be walking around like jack. need to follow procedure 20 years later, when i'm in my 60s and then you know that becomes complicated and. I was like so. I tried to avoid it as long as possible and i'm never going to be 100% right but."
13300.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"i'm pretty functional right so. Like I can't complain, but but, again, you know I talked to people that have chronic pain like I can relate because it's like I know I know what you're going through. stressful it is."
13300.0,Patient,It just it seems like I really do need that Walker more announcing like down worse yeah yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Well, hopefully, you get it sooner than later. You have any other exercises or any other stretching activities or anything like that."
13300.0,Patient,"No, I haven't been at home, I did when I was doing therapy, you know we got a gym downstairs I I should go there and kind of like duty bicycle or something that's what I need to do. Is. I can walk from here to there and i'll start. off in in puffin I mean losing weight, though, so i've been doing good on there because i've been eating good. This is all."
724.0,Provider,"Good. uh. What are some of the other things you want to work on, while you're hearing treatment like what do you want it, what do you want to get out of it, what are some of your goals."
13300.0,Patient,"Well, my main goal is to get on the opioid. I did well on that which i'm very happy. and medicine boy I don't think I was taking it right At first it was just awful taste awful and I think this costume costume he real bad."
724.0,Provider,"yeah it's it's still have the opiate family, so what happens is it hydrates you."
13300.0,Patient,Right so.
724.0,Provider,You need to drink more water okay.
13300.0,Patient,cousin Willy i'm really concentrated. yeah I got it. Down pat now keep it with my I read on instruction take a little SIP first and then put it under there under the mask is not faster. Happy get the medicine not really overcome over. Like I accomplished something i'm proud of myself.
724.0,Provider,Okay that's good yeah.
13300.0,Patient,yeah I never thought I need to stop them up to kill yeah cuz I know that don't work for thing.
724.0,Provider,"yeah you know they do there, so they. definitely do what they're supposed to do. But they eventually."
13300.0,Patient,end up leaving a little boost to.
724.0,Provider,"yeah well they Max out to as far as like their advocacy goes like it. it'll get to a certain point, and your body will develop like a adapted adapts to it and the tolerance and then it's like it's not doing anything for you anymore, but now you have the secondary issue now because you're not getting the the benefit that it used to provide you. And then, without it now you're sick. If the lose lose situation."
13300.0,Patient,Oh yes.
724.0,Provider,"And that's that's the unfortunate thing you know if you know if the pain medication wasn't you know wasn't addictive, you know. The actual for abuse and you dealt with a pain, to a certain degree that allowed you to be marginally functional without reactivating the injury, then it would be perfect, but that's not what it does. it's people like like a false sense of security, like oh I don't feel anything anymore, I must be better and the reality is is that you still have a significant injury that now you're just adding to it, because you can't feel anything so it's like. And I repeated on it right next to the bed where first thing when we could."
13300.0,Patient,"Well, though the. I can never said so I just say suboxone."
724.0,Provider,suboxone buprenorphine.
13300.0,Patient,"You for nor thing yeah. yeah so i'm happy with that I like I like the group therapy talking to other people. So it turned out really well my boyfriend told me he said when I was trying to get off before he said, you need to go somewhere where you know you need to get the therapy to not just get off the pill get the therapeutic goes along with it, so I like that."
724.0,Provider,"So outside of outside of that What else do you want to work on, while you're here with me anything, in particular, you want to talk about or just continue to maintain the you know the pain management portion of it."
13300.0,Patient,i'm. really doing well with the pain management part. So what am I supposed to talk to you about it's almost the same thing right.
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah just like things that are going on, so like we do like our like the updates on. we'll make sure that the medications still going well you know checking on your on your physical health make sure, things are going well with that any kind of mental health concerns if you have them. We can address that talking about that environmental factors, you know you know for people it's like work, you know money housing stuff like that, and then. The potential for like relapse if that if that was to happen and then just things that you want to work on it's like so you have a goal on it's like yeah I want to get to the gym more often and I don't really know how to go about doing that."
13300.0,Patient,"yeah i'm gonna start going down here now. Going downstairs to the gym just i'll start on try to start like just one Okay, nobody ever how it goes into."
