706.0,Provider,"Chris Cooper no show for therapy. hi brandon. hello, how are you."
16443.0,Patient,pretty good.
706.0,Provider,"Good so today we're going to do your bps, which is a bio psychosocial it's just a bunch of questions, just to get some background on you to see what we need to work on it therapy um, so why don't we start with what brings you to bright heart health."
16443.0,Patient,"I was currently in holders health system for. About a year year and a half. Okay, they decided they was going to do away with the behavior health there. Okay, so I was just trying to find a place that would work with my work schedule. You guys have actually been able to do that i've been on 612 at the plant for two months right now we're supposed to be done December 20."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16443.0,Patient,So it's just I never know what schedule i'm working so I took three days off this week and I go back tomorrow mm hmm to try to get all my appointments taken care of not only with you guys but actual you know my main doctor that I see for my diabetes and stuff.
706.0,Provider,Okay okay so um. looks like you are here for the opioid use disorder Program.
16443.0,Patient,Oh. yeah.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so why don't you tell me a little bit about that so when was the first time that you used any kinds of drugs or alcohol."
16443.0,Patient,"um I got stabbed in the right eye. Five years ago and was in it was in a coma and after after that i've had 2424 surgeries on my face and I, and like nine or my body. Due to my eye. And I was on pain pills through the hospital huh."
706.0,Provider,Oh you're muted.
16443.0,Patient,"On him he's he's trying to figure out going on with my appointment with him, I had to schedule him a physical. But uh I was on pain medication percocet tim's and I took them as a was needed I didn't take it, I had a prescription for him every day I didn't I didn't take them every day because I didn't need them every day, and when that doctor went out of business and Columbus. I come down here to met megs county and there is no pain clinics within two hours away. my sister told me that suboxone helps for pain. And so I had tried it out It made me sick or first. and It takes the pain away but it doesn't take the actual nerve pain away that I have going on, like the PR you know the percocet took all the pain away. I didn't really depend on them, you know I could just take them when I need the suboxone you either take it or you're going to get sick."
706.0,Provider,"So you didn't get sick when you were taking the percocet like if you didn't take it for a few days you didn't feel sick. No okay so it's not so you're in what we call the opioid opioid use disorder program because you're on suboxone so that's why that's the that's the program that prescribes the suboxone. um, but it may not be that you actually formed a dependency on an opioid bike prior to, but now you have sort of a dependency on the suboxone does that make sense. yeah so what happens is the suboxone fills the receptors in your brain that tell you that you need to take pain medication. For pain relief suboxone files that so that if you were using purpose at whatever you could stop using it, and it would fill those receptors in the brain because suboxone is. In your in those receptors of your brain, even if you took percocet now it wouldn't really help you because that those receptors are already felt so that's why, if you use suboxone it can help with the pain management, if that makes sense."
16443.0,Patient,yeah I have a I have a relapse one time since i've been on I don't have time to relapse I you know I I just go to work and come home to the kids that's.
706.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, so you really didn't use any drugs or alcohol like as a teenager or anything like that it just started when you got stabbed five years ago."
16443.0,Patient,yeah I don't smoke drink grub I don't do enough um.
706.0,Provider,"Okay um so that that that's good like i'm glad that we got that information because I mean that's really important, when we talk about you know your therapy moving forward is you know what is it that we need to work on. So when you were stabbed five years ago, what I mean what happened, what what's the story with that."
16443.0,Patient,"I sold my house and I own the mason mason West Virginia I own the hotel over there and mason and I sold it to one of my buddies that on a barge company. And my cousin two of my cousins was working for him at the time, and he wrote me a check I took it to get it cash they wouldn't cash, it had to wait 14 days for it. And so I pulled $40,000 out to go by 2016 people supposed to been brand new well there wasn't a jeep they just took me out in the country and robbed me."
706.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh. that's terrible that's true oh my gosh that's a lot of trauma to experience."
16443.0,Patient,Five of the a is in prison right now for like 13 to 19 years they videoed it.

706.0,Provider,wow why.
16443.0,Patient,"I don't know I didn't press charges, the state picked it up, we handle things differently, you know. Oh, my gosh."
706.0,Provider,Did you didn't know these people you didn't.
16443.0,Patient,know it was family.
706.0,Provider,It was family. yeah it was family that did that to you. Okay there's there's just a lot of that's just that's horrible like where they close family. and So do you feel like it was just you were you were just set up like that was the plan all along.
16443.0,Patient,"Oh yeah yeah it will set up I knew, when I was child locked in the back of a jeep and when we got out there, I knew something was up on the door wouldn't open. You know, it made a megs county news."
706.0,Provider,yeah well i'm sure wow so and they stabbed you in the eye.
16443.0,Patient,"They hit me once right there that's what that score, right here from. What they you know where the site is on the end of a rifle."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16443.0,Patient,"Well that's what actually hit me right there and then, when I refuse to give them my money up the second time it went through my bone in my brain."
706.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh i'm so sorry, you went through that."
16443.0,Patient,yeah happens.
706.0,Provider,"you're a lot calmer about it than I would have been, I guess, but I think you know I mean it's been a while I still I don't think I would be able to be as strong as you are talking about it that's that's a pretty traumatic thing so have you felt like you have had. ptsd from that do you have flashbacks do you have any."
16443.0,Patient,"yeah i'll wake up through out tonight you know, sometimes I just tried to do was. uh huh it's hard to explain to somebody and get medicine for that you know it's."
706.0,Provider,"Oh, do you have any diagnosis of any mental illness at all."
16443.0,Patient,uh. I mean. Not that i'm aware of.
706.0,Provider,Okay.
16443.0,Patient,I mean after all of that happened I uh I got banned from every speedway in the nation. For trying to beat one of the guys up I broke a cooler trying to get to.
706.0,Provider,One of the guys did that to him.
16443.0,Patient,"He was he was working at speedway I know I didn't know it when I went in there and then, when I seen him I just flipped a switch."
706.0,Provider,yeah cuz you had while you had a traumatic response.
16443.0,Patient,yeah so I got I got banned and. Putting the monkey suit for seven days.
706.0,Provider,"uh huh. wow Okay, but no actual diagnosis you've never done like a psych EVAL and gotten a diagnosis of like depression or ptsd or."
16443.0,Patient,"On i'm on. symbol, I think, is the name of it. Okay i'm on that. daily. It doesn't help it doesn't help for the. You know the. The backsplashes you know I don't have them all day every day it's just certain certain things trigger it, you know. I don't know how to explain it is. they're just there."
706.0,Provider,"ya know there's the when you when you will experience a trauma. And then you, it can be the simplest thing like a noise and you can re experience that trauma. You become really traumatized by that trigger so I mean I completely understand what you're saying it's hard to explain, but I know what you I know what you're saying like it could be something just really simple and then you'll have a flashback so um. So I mean that's definitely something that we can work on in therapy because therapy is the best way to combat ptsd. And there are some medications that can help but therapy is definitely the best way because you talk about it process and once it's out of your brain, then you don't flash back to it if that makes sense."
16443.0,Patient,"Well, I thought that too, but somehow the video gets linked on Facebook or YouTube you know every so often so when you're scrolling through Facebook and you see that or one of your friends see that and they tag in it."
706.0,Provider,Why would they tag you in it.
16443.0,Patient,"I know. it's just the way life works, I guess, I don't even ride in the passenger seat of nothing if i'm not driving physically. I will not ride with a soul. I don't care."
706.0,Provider,"You have to be in control. I mean, I understand I understand I mean what you went through is absolutely horrible and traumatic and. wow. So. Have you had any like suicidal ideations through any of us."
16443.0,Patient,know. i'm leaving. i'm starting to get like a what they call a. spider Web. spider web in my left eye I guess is what they call it like a webbing. Something like that and. it's it's going to go sooner or later.

You know that you have you know that stretch of children, you know little you know, on up and that's that's a lot to handle. So how'd you oldest 113 13 so you've got 10 months, all the way up to 13. yeah that's that's a handful I would I would agree with you, if you had free time you would probably sleep before you had all of these children when you did have a little bit of free time what did you enjoy doing when you weren't working."
16443.0,Patient,ride my Harley.

16443.0,Patient,"No, but I do start them up in the garage."
706.0,Provider,"Okay well that's something that's something i'm maybe maybe you'll be able to make some time at some points you can take a ride because that's really good i'm. gonna buy coping skill. To deal with stress, because you have that feeling of freedom that that thrill of the rides that kind of thing and that's usually really good with stress management and it sounds like you probably have quite a bit of stress."
16443.0,Patient,I just want to sleep.
706.0,Provider,yeah I can understand that.
16443.0,Patient,"The gabba gabba been it, I mean it takes the like the I don't know how to explain it I got a metal plate that runs across my cheek right here. I got a titanium piece that runs on my nose and I don't have a tear duct anymore so it's like when it gets cold, you know it, it hurts. Some, and so I just go that route, with it, but you know dealing with it."
706.0,Provider,"yeah i'm gabapentin usually helps with nerve pain, I mean that's usually the, the one that helps the most with that, so I think you're on the right thing and. So on a day to day basis what would you rate your stress level."
16443.0,Patient,"Oh, I don't know. five."
706.0,Provider,What country most of.

So i've seen a new patrol movie like 100 times, it was cute like the first 50 but after that no i'm over it, but yeah they just got their their phases um so what would you say are your biggest stressors day to day the things that causes you the most stress."
16443.0,Patient,Hello oh.
706.0,Provider,"I mean, do you feel like you, because you're working. These 12 hour shifts I mean obviously that's stressful on you, your body, I mean that's that's a stressor in itself, but is there anything outside of that do you ever feel like. guilty, for instance, for not you know, having your kids more or do you fit do you have any kind of does there anything on a daily basis that kind of rolls through your head that causes you stress. related really okay that's fair i'm."
16443.0,Patient,"Not like a thank you, I mean they're probably is."
706.0,Provider,"yeah no and sometimes it's hard to identify what about your self esteem, how do you feel yourself esteem us."
16443.0,Patient,Stay hidden. law says stay hidden.
706.0,Provider,Stay hidden.
16443.0,Patient,let's different going 25 years with two eyeballs on then.
706.0,Provider,So so because of your injury you feel like you kind of have to hide hide away.
16443.0,Patient,Oh yeah I mean it's. Having no eyeballs pretty noticeable.
706.0,Provider,mm hmm. Have you have they do you have an option to have like a an implant or anything like that.
16443.0,Patient,"I have one it don't move it makes me look like a guy off Mr needs, you know crazy on."
706.0,Provider,Okay i'm okay. So you just rather not do deal with that.
16443.0,Patient,yeah gotcha gotcha.
706.0,Provider,"I mean everything you say makes sense man it's absolutely I would say, within the normal range of the way that you feel for what happened to you. And I think the big thing is the trauma that you've experienced over the last five years, not just the crime that was done to you, but also all of the aftermath. because all of the surgeries all of the pain, all of the everything that's all trauma and you know when you have those flashbacks you your retry monetized. And so it's can be very stressful on your on your brain on your mental health i'm just your well being so which can actually make your pain worse. Stress can actually make your pain worse and so maybe want some of the stuff that you have kind of. floating around inside once that's dealt with and kind of talked about that could also lesson some of the pain that you're having because it can manifest itself stress can manifest itself in."
16443.0,Patient,"other ways, such as pain."
706.0,Provider,So. um did you have any questions for me.
16443.0,Patient,"No. um there was they put me on high blood pressure, medicine yesterday."

706.0,Provider,"Okay, so um and who put you on that."
16443.0,Patient,Dr holly.
706.0,Provider,"Dr holly okay. Okay, so she must have noticed something with your your blood pressure that was concerning so. You know, trying to get that down, which you know could be you know chasm stress could have you know quite a lot of things going on, so."
16443.0,Patient,They said it was up there was like one. thing he said was like. On 50 something over 128 Somalia. OK.
706.0,Provider,"So I mean definitely probably need to be on something um. So no that's good, what do you have any other questions."
16443.0,Patient,Is there anything that made me sleep better.
706.0,Provider,"um There probably is I don't prescribe medications I do the therapy, but you want to talk to your doctor so Dr holly and let her know that you're having trouble sleeping and there are different things that they can try to help."
16443.0,Patient,"They give me. know. i've tried, I mean they've given me several things. I got them all right here. trash day."
