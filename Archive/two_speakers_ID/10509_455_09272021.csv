455.0,Provider,"i'm doing well, can I have your name and birthday."
10509.0,Patient,"Yes, Eric Ferguson."
455.0,Provider,"All right, how's everything going for you."
10509.0,Patient,"Oh everything's going okay. I had a rough month. um. i've missed some sessions which I am. I was in so the month of. late August in September, I went to a detox facility. And then. No shit yet coming from a detox facility, I was in Kentucky I went down in Tennessee for the weekend and coming back home, I flipped my truck three times on I 75 just south of lexington and. I was in really bad shape. At second degree burns up my side and broke a few bones and and just finally up to where I can you know get around and move. um, but it was a couple weeks ago, or maybe I was two groups ago I tried to log into my group and they said I was out of compliance or something like that and I had to talk to you before I could go back in okay. So. Because they said I was going to be kicked out of the program but like I said I told my probation officer, that I was going to the detox facility and then obviously I I gotten the accident and I was bedridden at that point in time so. that's kind of. that's kind of been my last four weeks okay."
455.0,Provider,how's your sobriety.
10509.0,Patient,"My sobriety is it's tough i'll be honest with you um. You know i've i've tossed you know, I was honest a boxing program before, to be honest with you and. I went through a batch of. I don't know if you want to call it, I guess, I was kind of suicidal in a sense, and I wasn't like that. Before I was on the suboxone but my my mood has drastically changed, so what my doctor did is they put me on wellbutrin. In the wellbutrin. uh. It didn't really seem to help all that you know what I mean so um i've just been kind of tentative on being on the suboxone. You know what I mean and I didn't know, there was any you know me my wife had been talking about you know trying it again, or if there's anything else I could take with us to box and to help for the depression, but the depression was just really severe you know being on it."
455.0,Provider,Understandable have you tried to not tracks home or better trump.
10509.0,Patient,"uh I have, I have not what's the first one."
455.0,Provider,"i'll check zone naltrexone is it's the same medication now tracks on pill form vivid. vivid trawlers an injection. it's so how well a medication does what it's supposed to do is called the efficacy, so the efficacy of suboxone and i'll tracks on or about equal within a couple of percentages, so they both work and I both work well. helps control impulses stop the cravings and. help people remain sober suboxone is much more popular for two main reasons, one is suboxone has some pain control built into it and to. it's fairly easy to get started on suboxone you need to wait at least 24 hours after using your last opiate which kind of sucks but, most people can do that fairly well naltrexone. It has good sites to it, meaning in that it is not habit for me, you can stop cold Turkey nothing happens at once, so that's that's what's something different than suboxone. But the reason why spices more popular is that, in order to get started on naltrexone you have to be about five days off of opiates in order has started on track so. yeah and most people either aren't willing to or can't do that so it's good for people coming out of detox coming out of jail coming out of a sober living House something where they are sober for five days or longer. And then the down another downside is it doesn't have the pink control built in. Okay, so. But. Like I said. Good parts is you can't stop it cold Turkey nothing happens you're not dependent on it. But it does work about just as well as suboxone."
10509.0,Patient,gotcha.
455.0,Provider,questions you have for me about that.
10509.0,Patient,"Well, I guess, I forgot to put this on my soapbox and story, it was. A. i'm going to say, maybe a month, five, six weeks ago I was going to get back on actually they prescribing subindex. All right, that was my counselor there with you guys, the one I do with my one on one well I had waited about 30 hours, since my last hit I thought that was heroin and I guess it was I was using fentanyl. I waited about 30 hours symptoms were there I don't know how severe they worse, it was a very well I call the the doctor there right heart and. i'm like are the facility and i'm like Okay, I think i'm ready to take it they're like okay well, what are you going through and I told him like Okay, we should be safe, well, I take it, and I go into precipitated withdraw. And that was. I was, and I was just I was just got done at a golf tournament I was like an hour and a half, away from home, but you know the symptoms were just you know wedding you know my nose is running those yawn and peoples were dilated to you know I thought I was there. And I take the sub you tax and oh my God that was I went to the emergency room and marysville Ohio I tell them take me to the mercial because it was closer than home and I had never gone through precipitating withdrawal before. Right at that was an expert I guess. That experience to alone was really tough for me to uh you know it's scary to go back on the doctor told me yeah you're you're good to go and then i'm on it, well then. They said well you know what do I do as I because I couldn't decide whether go the hospital or not i'm like well, what do I do, and they said well you're becoming a way to half hour and take another suboxone pill. Right and I took another one well that just seemed to make things worse, and so I was in the you know emergency room for about five hours they were just pumping me drugs into me so that was kind of my last experience trying to get on it. You know it's just scary but you know i'll be honest with you. I need something you know i'm not gonna lie I don't have it, I don't have it under control and cravings are still ungodly you know I mean. And the thing is, I have a really good job i'm i'm a director of operations for a company a venture capital firm in Columbus and I, like my job and i'm good at it and it pays me a lot of course I don't want to lose it and prayed you know if I don't get back on something i'm going to. sure you know, so I know that's in my future and I, and I gotta do something so but, like you said waiting five days a year, you know that. That might be tough for me. Now you know."
455.0,Provider,"Alright, so those are the two medications that we can prescribe that there is the third option is methadone which we don't do, but you know, there are some local methadone clinics and that's a daily medication. So. Out of the the suboxone and and or not tracks home, what do you what are which one, are you leaning towards."
10509.0,Patient,"Probably the suboxone. And you know the although you know i've done it twice the one. This was before I got on probation got with you guys, it was about a year ago I was on suboxone for a hot minute and I was on the strips. And I know there's not there's not a difference, I don't think the strips or their tablet form, but the the strip T I seem to do better with. You know i'm not sure why you know I don't even know what was causing the depression it couldn't couldn't even have been the suboxone you know I don't know I just at that time that that's what was going on, so. Sure, but I would definitely I think the probably the suboxone for me just. You know, it would be better. insured, but beyond to be waiting five days I don't know if I, if I have that willpower to be honest with you, I don't think it's you know I don't think it's doable so yeah um but yeah and then I guess the other thing is too is is you know we can do that. And I just want to make sure that i'm you know I liked the groups. That, I was in I just you know I wasn't allowed to be on the group they told me I couldn't be on the group so last two weeks, which was kind of a bummer, but I just want to make sure that I can get back in the group tomorrow that would be awesome."
455.0,Provider,"yeah so two questions here, it says you're allergic to enough track naloxone Is that correct."
10509.0,Patient,allergic to the locks them. I don't know where they got that from.
455.0,Provider,Okay So what are the what is the reason you're on separate tax.
10509.0,Patient,"On suboxone well, I was talking to the lady, the first time I did my interview there with you guys and. The lady that was talking to she's no longer with you that's why I think I went to your group and not hurt. she's the one. She put me on sublime text because of the time I had with the suboxone before she said, the sublime text because they give you subby tech so one of the detox is, I was in a while back they gave me some text, while I was there. And so, but suboxone want to get out in Ohio or for some reason enough it's everywhere, they don't give you some you text here. And, but when I was in the clinic the detox clinic the somebody text didn't make me feel so down and out. As far as my mood went well, I mean, so it seemed to be a seam to seam I had a lot more energy with the savvy tech side of the suboxone."
455.0,Provider,"But we were we also established that the depression could be caused by something else we're not hundred percent sure, and your Scott, you said earlier, more leaning towards the strips you think that that those might work better, for you correct."
10509.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
455.0,Provider,"yeah I agree, I, like the strips better tend to have a better absorption. Is the same medications but here's the thing if the pill doesn't dissolve is not getting absorbed. And sometimes it takes five minutes or more to get that pill to dissolve. So, as opposed to the strip so. it's a lot it's often 10 seconds and you're done so, if you're okay with it i'd prefer you go on the strips."
10509.0,Patient,yeah hundred percent.
455.0,Provider,"Okay. Alright, so i'll go ahead and and we do need a release of information, signed on the. Inpatient Center just to verify that you were there and then i'm more than happy to keep you in the Program. Because what will happen what was going to happen is you're going to get discharged to a higher level of care, which was an Inpatient Center and then have you come back after the Inpatient Center but it sounds like you already did that so. But we do we need to keep a close eye on you will give you like, a month of probationary period. Making sure you're attending your groups, making sure your urine screens are done and everything like that, because we. It did seem like you're struggling missing a lot of visits and struggling with your cravings, and so we want to make sure that we're the right place for you and make sure that you don't need something more aggressive. than us, you know somebody who can monitor you more closely, I guess it's a better way to. say it. Alright, so go ahead and you what groups were you in."
10509.0,Patient,Tuesdays at noon.
455.0,Provider,"Okay, all right we'll continue those groups when was your last opiate use."
10509.0,Patient,um yesterday.

10509.0,Patient,I probably like to. Yes.
455.0,Provider,"I agree, so what I can do is give you some comfort medications something it's not going to take away the craving or the withdrawals but or help manage them something for restlessness something for the anxiety, the sweating the shaking something to help you sleep tonight."
10509.0,Patient,Okay.
455.0,Provider,Do you have any allergies at all. No okay alright so i'll go ahead and there'll be about four or five different medications along with the suboxone and a prescription for narcan at the pharmacy and then we'll see you again tomorrow at noon.
