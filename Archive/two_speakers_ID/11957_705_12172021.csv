So my experience with therapy has not been all that great i've had the same group every week on Tuesdays for for a while now, and that seems to be helping. Right, but should I tell you what happened that got me here."
705.0,Provider,"Sure, if you feel comfortable."
11957.0,Patient,"yeah so um. I lost my firstborn child to suicide. Or, and after I found out. My insurance was canceled by the state and I couldn't get my psychiatric medicine and I attempted suicide. So my children now live with their father my two youngest live with their father, I have four total my second son is 18 he goes to Idaho State University. And i've been financially helping him for quite some time now, about a year. So i'm my two youngest live with their father now and he's living with his mother and the kids. And he has a court order that says, I cannot, I have no contact i'm not allowed to have any contact with my children. Until a therapist says it's appropriate and then we have to go to therapy together. So. um so. I went to the hospital. I was on a hole for three days, and then they transferred me to another unit and I checked myself out. They had lost my purse and I didn't want my identity stolen and I went to the emergency department to give my purse. So I had to check out to do that."
705.0,Provider,And then you checked out of the hospital and what happened next.
11957.0,Patient,I went back to my. My psychiatrist and he prescribed the medicine that the hospital had prescribed me to take I didn't take the medicine for about a month because I wanted to. see if I can manage my moods myself.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11957.0,Patient,I had no ability to concentrate or think or or mean I blackout stare off into nothing for hours at a time. So I went back on the medicine and then I got hooked up with bright heart call.

11957.0,Patient,My therapy therapy with my children. their father will not let me have any contact with the kids.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, I misunderstood than any I thought there was a part of it, that if you did have therapy with the children that there was some type of sometimes a reunification plan is an owner, but that's not your case. No quiet quiet."
11957.0,Patient,"When their therapist says it's appropriate for them to talk to me, then we can start therapy. But he's not going to let them see your speak to me he's done this before."
705.0,Provider,Okay.
11957.0,Patient,"So when they're with me he has no contact with children and then, when they're with him, he has doesn't allow any contact with me. my daughter is sneaking around behind his back right now messaging me. On instagram."
705.0,Provider,"So tough situation anywhere, you know, especially as a kid wanted to reach out to her mom i'm sure she's confused, you know wants her mom."
11957.0,Patient,know. That dad won't let it. No matter what anyone says.
705.0,Provider,How long that has that been going on.
11957.0,Patient,"It went on for a year and a half, and then I got the kids because he left the state that it was living in without notifying me and took off with the kids and the police found them in hemet in a motel room. So they so they return the kids to me and I had the kids up until my April of the share. When I gave the kids back to him. And then he went to court that a court order that says that I can't have any contact with the kids."
705.0,Provider,"Is that indefinite or it just shares like things to do, like sometimes they'll say you know seek treatment your medication."
11957.0,Patient,"Do service that. we're supposed to do to 12 sessions of therapy, all of us. But I haven't had 12 sessions of therapy, because I don't have a regular therapist with right. The first one, I had flaked on me and the next one, it took me weeks to get an appointment and then he kept flaking out on me multiple times."
705.0,Provider,"i'm sorry that happened me, and so, for you and I will do today is start the process and start where you know, like, I appreciate we're getting to know one another today.

11957.0,Patient,we're well.
705.0,Provider,when's the last time that you had any thoughts of harming yourself.
11957.0,Patient,When I attempted suicide.
705.0,Provider,"Back in. April and April. Since then, no type of even fleeting thoughts."
11957.0,Patient,No.
705.0,Provider,"that's that's great and any you know, right now, your medications are working you're mindful of it. If ever that that does come up please share with me if let's say it's not on a day, yet that you and I are not scheduled, you can always call the virtual Center and share with them it's a crisis. If if i'm not available they'll get you someone else from the team, but you know things like that we don't want you to suffer in silence, we want you to get the help that you need and deserve. Have you ever used to the suicide hotline like the 988."
11957.0,Patient,I didn't know it about nine eight.
705.0,Provider,"You know you used to have to dial the one 800 number and they've made it easier if you can't remember 988 just dial 911 and they'll get you to the suicide hotline, but you can also dial 988. And then there's another text support it's a crisis counselor it's a 741741 and you text back and forth, with a crisis counselor and it's not specifically for suicide I just like to give people the says resources do you happen to have a pen and piece of paper."
11957.0,Patient,So 988 is suicide.
705.0,Provider,Prevention hotline.
11957.0,Patient,Okay.
705.0,Provider,And then 741741.
11957.0,Patient,What is that.
705.0,Provider,"And that is it's a text crisis it's a hotline or crisis counselors work with you it's not specifically for suicide if you're having you know. Just some challenges that day, and you don't feel like talking to anyone, but you're willing to text, it is free it's a great resource to have just in your tool belt to have extra resources."
11957.0,Patient,Thank you.
705.0,Provider,"So so great, so those are some resources i'm you know i'm. Having were already any you set yourself up where you're like you know what i'm going to quit smoking i'm already dedicating this weekend, I think that that's a great goal, you know that you have there and i'll check in when we meet again. I just to see how you're doing with that is there anything else, that you can think of any that you want to set as a goal for for at least like this week."
11957.0,Patient,Another goal. scooping my cat litter box out every day. which I haven't yet today.
705.0,Provider,"Okay yeah I have a cat too, so I know how that is. Not not one of the funnest things and I always have to think of my mind Okay, a cat's name is Dora Dora can't clean it out herself, so I guess i'll do it. So great so a goal of being able then to scoop out maintain the cat box every day."
11957.0,Patient,Every day.
705.0,Provider,"I think that that would be a good one. And what i'm going to do to is send you the. i'm going to send you that codependency assessment, and so what I will."
11957.0,Patient,email that to me.
705.0,Provider,i'm going to email it right now and I like to see them make sure it gets to you. So let me just get your email up here. going to attach that if it comes up here. So I sent that to you and and so that should be headed your way. And there will be one of codependency it's a whole leaflet it'll tell you a little bit about what codependency anonymous is about.
11957.0,Patient,"I think I deleted, it can you resend it."
705.0,Provider,Open that back up. let's see if this one's gonna go.
11957.0,Patient,got it.
705.0,Provider,"Perfect so then just take a look at it um you know see what you think you can try down notes always nice to kind of keep track of. Of what you like, and compliance patterns, you can always circle, if anything, that you really if you relate to it, you can just circle that piece, or like control pattern circle what you identify with. And then we can you know continue. To talk about the codependency a little bit more check in about. How you're going with the no nicotine and then you and I are going to meet again we have on the 30th scheduled for five o'clock.

Perfect for any reasons if you're not able to you know attend just just let us know and we'll reschedule but it looks like them were set on this and I know we've been kind of talking about different topics here and there. Do you have any questions before we end the session."
11957.0,Patient,And we were on the stages of grief.
705.0,Provider,"yeah I think that that would be a good one. there's also and i'll look into a little bit more. So there's support groups and sometimes there's support groups for survivors that had like a family member or friends that have lost a loved one to suicide. Would that be something to me that you would be may be interested in. I liked how open, you are to trying these different things, I think that that's going to you know again just help you in your healing process."
