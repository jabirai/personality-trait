13347.0,Patient,Really and that's. What I keep saying and they're pretty fortunate so. You know they're not going to miss anything from me it's just me who's going to know it.

383.0,Provider,uh huh yeah and how are you doing with regards to kind of. Maybe building a little activity or hobby or interest or any other thoughts on that two or.
13347.0,Patient,"To be perfectly honest, no I hadn't thought about it. yeah I just hadn't thought about it."
383.0,Provider,"yeah what, what do you want, what do you feel like you'd like to use this appointment to talk about."
13347.0,Patient,"I really don't know to be perfectly honest, like I said i've been going to a therapist for six and a half years and i've talked all my. My. Bad stuff out, you know so and i've cried and i've written letters and I breathe in you know so i've done the process there. You know so. it's hard for me to say to you, you know let's do therapy because i've already done, the therapy and the work for it, you know, and I and i'm happy and like I said i'm happy i'm no longer angry I don't I don't go off. angry like I used to and I used to be really bad I punched in doors, and you know, so I used to be really bad with ptsd so. uh huh and that's. Left since i've been going to the psychiatrist, which is only two and a half years yeah so you know, so I mean I don't know if i'm taking up a space that I shouldn't be taking up because of somebody else but I need to psychiatrist."
383.0,Provider,"Right right well, maybe we can check in less frequently and that's fine, I just wanted to you had when I asked you about what your goals were when I think I forgot in our first appointment. You said, to make sure I stay the person I became and then you said I have panic attacks and then you also said, for support around my health my brain tumor worries me."
13347.0,Patient,"yeah it does it does, but I have. They took all that information today and they're putting in the referral for my neurologist at this point in time so that's good thing, so that I can get an MRI because it's been three years since i've had that and that's been a big worry and so has. The one with the breast I forget what the name is right now mami abram. uh huh so they're going to take care of that as well."
383.0,Provider,"Okay well. So you don't do. Are you not having panic attacks, I think kind of settling down for you, where you're not you're having those less much less frequently."
13347.0,Patient,"less frequently the and they last they don't last quick quite as long you know so. But I think that that might be, because I usually as soon as I have my will take a clot a pen to calm myself down because I don't want to in any way, shape or form get angry over stupid stuff."
383.0,Provider,uh huh.
13347.0,Patient,You know.
383.0,Provider,"yeah okay. well. I think that. We can probably decrease your appointment frequency down for for individually for my appointments and I can just see you like, once a month."
