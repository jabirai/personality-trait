You know what your goals are i'm coming here to break heart health um what are some of the things that you're experiencing that you would like to see different. is getting kind of like a picture of you know. Your history if you know if you've. been in treatment before what that looks like. So tell me a little bit about yourself."
15862.0,Patient,I i've been using for about three years. And i'm just looking to stay sober for a little bit and then possibly move away. skin out of this city of Toledo.

726.0,Provider,"Better now okay. And how are you i'm using that. Okay, and you said it's been about three years, you said. yeah before that were you using anything else."
15862.0,Patient,Just marijuana drinking.
726.0,Provider,"And, have you been in treatment before."
15862.0,Patient,army yeah i've detox I went to a detox that's it. Before. But I got a new doctor. And he he took me off like within the first week of being with them. Almost a year.
726.0,Provider,Were you want before you took you offered.
15862.0,Patient,By suboxone.
726.0,Provider,"suboxone oh OK OK. And where what facility, did you go to for detox."
15862.0,Patient,or Midwest.
726.0,Provider,Midwest okay. How long were you there for. New repeat it just.
15862.0,Patient,Seven to 10 days.
726.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, and how long ago was that."
15862.0,Patient,There was just bow bow couple weeks ago.
726.0,Provider,"So corey why you're in the program the way that it works is you would get prescribed the buprenorphine through the prescriber so you would have to do group during the week I don't know if you've already been assigned to a group yet do you know. Yes, Okay, so you would be assigned to a group, and then you would meet with me individually every two weeks so from today we'd make an appointment for two weeks from today, so we see twice a month and so. As long as the way it works is your medications everything the prescriptions that they would all stay the same. But if i'm like if a patient's not showing up not going to groups not going to individual sessions what they do is that don't start like like instead of giving you seven days so give you five days, instead of giving you the five days will give you four days so that's based off of. You know the kind of participation in the treatment and. And I think you already probably have seen some of the surveys that they'll send you Those are just periodically, you know people have to do those um so within the group process. You would have a facilitator, that would be conducting the group, and then the prescriber would also be there, so if you have any questions about how things are working, how how your body's feeling in it with the medication you let them know. And they can also prescribe and send out for you to get like narc can just in case I think it's always good to have one anyways because you just never know because our program is really a harm reduction approach to it so. The prescriber can do that for you."
15862.0,Patient,"Okay yeah cuz they gave me just enough to get to today and then. They were going to figure out what they would do next, but I have group i'm pretty sure our Tuesdays or Thursdays at 1030."
726.0,Provider,I can check for you to end here in California already right so. Oh you're in Ohio okay um because their scheduling calendar is based on Pacific time so. i'm going to look what you have here and i'm going to put three hours ahead because i'm also an Eastern time so I I always have to switch mentally the time be your next group is actually on the 19th which is. Thursday yes. yep it's. it's actually next Tuesday coming up. So it looks like you have for today I don't know if i'm were you aware of that.
15862.0,Patient,"No, I got an email saying that I start group on it."
726.0,Provider,"I will okay all right, then you should be fun so i'm just asked virtual clinic. Because they put you in as a no show, but it sounds like they told you that your start date was the 19th so I don't want the notion to look bad like you just didn't show up, but like you knew about it, didn't show up."
15862.0,Patient,So when I talked to about that.
726.0,Provider,"I saw your care navigator i'm your care navigators a person that's like in charge of your chart in a way, and if you're not able to talk to them, you can talk to anybody else that can help you out but you're on yours is verna. i'm verna radius. So. See if."
15862.0,Patient,I can get Ahold of her.
726.0,Provider,"yeah I I can. have it in so. I would call virtual clinic or work done just so you can tell them that you got an email, they said they you start the 19th you have for today, you didn't know you were supposed to start today and it's put as a no show. So if they can out on my end i'll put an inquiry, but I would ask them about that okay."
15862.0,Patient,So just call that. Number the number okay. yeah I can do that.
726.0,Provider,"yeah because if you're not on top of it too it's really easy you're going to be like, why did they put me as a no show like stuff like this, like you, didn't know, and now it looks in the chart like he didn't show up when you actually just didn't know that you've had an opportunity so."
15862.0,Patient,"yeah I haven't even I said I seem to 19 so I thought I was good, because. She was saying, I started here soon, but I got an email, so I just was caught off of that."
726.0,Provider,"yeah no and you are good, but I would just make sure that they make it look good here."

726.0,Provider,"Okay well next week we'll have roof at 1030 in the morning, and so what I want to do is, I want to make sure we schedule something in two weeks so. I always say try to make your appointment for individuals and if you can just cancel and reschedule because if it doesn't help if there's a no show if you just didn't call because it just looks. not great, and the chart, especially when the doctor looks at a chart and they're seeing a lot of no shows it's different when someone calls in and says oh I can't make it like can I reschedule so i'm gonna. i'm gonna look at my calendar, so we can schedule something for two weeks from today, and I promise you you're going to like Dr so la she's awesome. Now i'm not going to so just so you know I can't do individual and group on the same day, so it has to be on a different day than your group. You would you want to do a Monday or Wednesday for. So I have available, right now. Five o'clock available on October 27 that's two weeks from today."
15862.0,Patient,yep I can do that five o'clock. yep. And then you guys just send me an email and everything with the link and stuff.
726.0,Provider,They should be sending you something that virtual clinic would do that.
15862.0,Patient,Okay. I just wanted to make sure.
726.0,Provider,"You have but I, you know, just in case corey I suggest to have like a mini notebook and write down the appointments, because what happens is. Sometimes I don't know I don't work in the virtual clinic department, so I don't know how to do that, but it gets very confusing to remember the appointments so try to take a note of it and leave it in the same notebook that you use every week, so you kinda like can see it yeah."
15862.0,Patient,I just had to remind her my phone.
726.0,Provider,Just a static theme in my phone things that.
15862.0,Patient,"appointment, it sets it in my schedule."
726.0,Provider,Okay perfect um corey any legal issues any probation anything with court. No okay um any past suicide attempts. Any ideation or thoughts of wanting to to hurt yourself. Right. So corey I will see you next week. At our group okay.
15862.0,Patient,"cool so then book, do you call them my prescription now or like How does that go, so I talked to somebody else."
726.0,Provider,"So when when you get off the phone call virtual clinic um you already because they'll know that you showed up to your appointment, so you met with me already so just call them and. Then they can set you up for your for your MED, so let me see if you have something scheduled for MED follow up. You do not so what I would do is i'm the prescriber is Dr sell sell a door, so you just say I have group on Tuesdays at 1030 or actually you could tell them 730 because that's their Pacific time. Can I make an appointment with my medical prescriber and then they can set you up for that."
15862.0,Patient,"Okay, and what I have to wait to see them till I get the prescription or."
726.0,Provider,"I don't think so I don't think that's the case, I think you'll be able to get something filled in, so I would urge you to call them today."
