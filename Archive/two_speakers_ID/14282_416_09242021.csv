14282.0,Patient,"Yes, Sir good."
416.0,Provider,"Good, thank you for being on time, too, I really appreciate that. So today we're are scheduled to do your initial session. and finish those sessions run a little bit differently, they involve me asking a lot of questions about like your history and. You know just to kind of get a good understanding of what's been going on that led you here. And if that's okay and and certainly if you have any questions for me you're welcome to ask them. Have you been in have you been in therapy before."
14282.0,Patient,"i'm have but only once, like literally just one therapy session in my life."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, why why only wants."
14282.0,Patient,"To did not go well, he actually went well, but the person I was assigned to she was, I guess, like at the end of she she was transferring somewhere. So it never occurred to me to just change it, it was more kind of like oh okay I just didn't continue, you know, so I have to go once I was a little confused because, like Okay, why was I sent her if she was."
416.0,Provider,disruptive.
14282.0,Patient,"yeah so I just never kind of followed up and. asked for a new one, I just didn't go anymore."
416.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
14282.0,Patient,"But it was good, though I did like it. Okay, yes."
416.0,Provider,What What did you like about it.
14282.0,Patient,"I like that she validated what I said she pretty much was the geek because at that time I was dealing with stuff at work and everyone was against me, and when I went to her, she was the first person to pretty much say. Something like not necessarily you're right but, but I have the right to feel how I feel you know so that was a. It was just I don't know how to describe it kind of like, finally, like. yeah my no. One is listening to me, so it was I expect that you know I just thought I was going to be pushed back again and being like you know. You know what you say famous as a matter of type thing, so it was a good experience."
416.0,Provider,"Good i'm glad, so I did read through your I read through your previous your notes with tanya and so you know we don't have to repeat everything, but I wanted to just hear in your own words. What what's going on that brought you to bright heart."
14282.0,Patient,"So the first thing that really got me to you guys is i'm going back to school, after a long, long break so i'm actually at university right now and i'm. i'm with the university housing and one of the things that they have for the rules for the apartments that I can't have any pets, unless I can. Prove that my pet is my emotional support dog, which is but i've never went through that like a formal way of doing it, you know, so my dog who's kind of like who's like my son really um. When I came back because, because I was with with my husband, I was living overseas, and then I came back so I can go to school and I couldn't bring my dog back with me just yet, because I was going to go back to my parents House and my dad is completely. Against dogs, so you know, since I was living with them the respect that i'm not going to bring my dog with me, however. I was always thinking that I was going to bring with him with me to university and then I when I read those verses and the adversity, that I had like I missed it attack you know because, like. Sudden me I feel like I still can't bring like the. The thing that like makes me happy, are you. Happy only someone who so important to you. yeah yeah so I read all the rules Center and it said there you know I need to. pretty much like prove that I do need this dog, and so I was like okay well if I need to do that i'll do whatever it is, I need to do and Sure enough, I go to break right heart and I started my group session. I think it was two weeks ago and I was. telling them like I was going I I still am, but at that time I was also going to a lot of stuff in my life and I were do the group sessions, and I was telling him like you know what here's why. Again, my dog is an angel because because of him, I am in this therapy, which I actually really need you know. yeah she brought me here, so when I think about it that way it's like gosh like. it's just it's just meant to be you know so. that's what brought me here, and also, I just have a lot of history that because, like due to my cultural background it's not it's kind of taboo to see. You know, a therapist or anyone that will help with your mental health, because you know we have been conditioned to kind of just keep that to ourselves. Like we don't tell people about those things oh yeah. i'm at that place in my life now where i've actually comfortable to talk about those things and I feel like I do need to release a lot of things and i've kind of been on this journey of journaling which I. I started like kind of just letting stuff out. Through social media actually because a lot of people don't know a lot about me and i'm I was thinking like you know what it's definitely to like let people get to know the real me, so I started like writing about me and i'm just flooded with these. words of encouragement and. Support really didn't expect I thought I was going to get precise because that's what i've been used to my whole life like judged and criticized, and then I wrote about. Many of the things that happened in my life and was nothing but like love and support, so I want to continue that and actually allow myself to be seen, you know. Excuse me bless you."
416.0,Provider,"So I mean I love that I love that that all sounds so healthy, I want to make sure before we go on that did did did could tanya talk to you about our ability to kind of write letters for therapy dogs and that sort of thing."
14282.0,Patient,"um I, yes I believe she just she said that she can do that she she didn't elaborate, but she did say that you guys can do that, yes."
416.0,Provider,"we've been told, we cannot do that."
14282.0,Patient,"Oh, you cannot okay."
416.0,Provider,"I mean there are possible workarounds like. Instead, in in lieu of a letter. We could you know explain that you're under our treatment. I mean if we have a release we could explain. That you're under our treatment. To the university or something like I mean we we we may be able to find a workaround because we do right those kinds of letters. But yeah we typically don't write like therapy dog letters and i'm not really sure why, but it is our agency policy. I don't know if that's a deal breaker for you."
14282.0,Patient,"um I think on the form it just said, one of the questions is. How long have I been in your care. I think. Let me just put it says."
416.0,Provider,Do you want to email me the form.
14282.0,Patient,Sure sure. What is it.
416.0,Provider,"i'm going to put it in the chat for you. good for you to have it anyway. There you go. Okay, so yeah if you email that to me i'll take a look at it okay. we'll figure something out. I am a gigantic dog lover to would you like to be my coast, do you like to meet my co therapist."

14282.0,Patient,"My husband's in Albanian right now so that's The other reason why i'm here is because. My husband's. The one that's really like my rock you know, like my my support, the one that I know loves me unconditionally doesn't judge me to to criticize me. And then I of course I come home to my parents house and it's like complete opposite like childhood all over again. So right now he's an old being here he's he's taking an electrician force facing sufficient still there and he's also still and integration process, so he is interviewed for his visa is in October, so."
416.0,Provider,from Albania.
14282.0,Patient,"Yes, okay."
416.0,Provider,"And you mentioned your cultural background, but I don't know what it is, where where's your family from."
14282.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"yeah. I have, I have. A number of Filipino patients who who have talked about how the struggles of getting mental health care. You know, within their family of origin. or even talking about that."
14282.0,Patient,huh oh yeah yeah. Right yeah.
416.0,Provider,"So. When did you start noticing, like some of the symptoms of some of your Depression and anxiety that your struggles."
14282.0,Patient,"um. it's interesting because I feel like i've buried them for a long time and. One of the times that I really. Had kind of like a lower breakdown was a 2016 where I quit my job I like got rid of my apartment I gave away like almost on a percent of my things like to charitable organizations. And I left to do a pilgrimage because I just couldn't understand what to do with my lengthening so I went to Spain to do a pilgrimage there and. The pilgrimage is about six weeks long and you walk for like 600 plus miles just to kind of like empty your head and just like try to figure out. You know why i'm really here, and all that stuff so that's when I feel like it was catching up to me, or to me, finally, where it just like keep it very. um and then after that I decided to go around a little bit, so I was there for six months, just tour, and I feel like I, I just wanted to be needed I just felt like. There was no one there to tell me how to act, there was there was no one there to tell me I shouldn't do this, you can't do that I could do whatever I wanted, and it was one of the happiest times of my life and then, of course, you know I had to come back. To start working again and all that stuff and I got engaged and then I came back and then i'm talk, talk a little bit. too. get some more funds, and then I went back there and I got married and then I stayed there for a couple of years and then that's when I decided, you know what I need to go back to school. So I come back to to America and I actually want a fellowship with the government fellowship program in Santa Clara county and I was assigned or I asked for the victim services unit, and then I was assigned to the child Advocacy Center and I did research in regards to. fittingly so child abuse, child neglect and also restorative justice principles. So when I was doing this research child abuse, like it was like ptsd like I was reading all this stuff and like crying i'm like about two paragraphs I crying. Because what we went through like me like. My siblings. So just like reading all that stuff it was like wow my dad could have easily gone to jail for child abuse and my mom could have easily gone to jail for child likes it she didn't do anything to protect my data so um but I always tell myself, you know. That my mom was scared herself, because my dad was scary you know, back then, so she can do anything to help us so i'm that on earth, a lot of things like doing stuff. For for. Child abuse. And that's actually what prompted me to write on social media about you know, not necessarily about the child needs part yet because it's still really tender, but about other stuff in my life that I never told anyone. So that's really when it like exploded, I feel like you know to come out so. That is what prompted me to do all of this, and you know, trying to get therapy and you don't kind of all just wanted me to that directions, you know, especially with my dog Harvey and I want you to do this motion. or dog or a therapist and suddenly this happens i'm like wow it's like all converging converging to like get some help and finally start to heal from that, instead of just keeping it under the rug."
416.0,Provider,That doesn't work.
14282.0,Patient,"yeah, no, no, no, not at all, not even close. Okay."
416.0,Provider,"Well i'm sure glad you're here. yeah so in terms of. growing up, it sounds like it was you and your mom and your dad you grew up in Santa Clara county."
14282.0,Patient,Sorry in Santa Cruz.
416.0,Provider,"Santa Cruz, and who else was in your House was it just the three of you or. Do you have siblings."
14282.0,Patient,"Yes, I have one younger brother and two younger sisters."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, and and. I mean you've kind of told me a little bit, but can you be tell me a little bit more about what it was like to grow up in your House."
14282.0,Patient,"It was just. we're just always scared. So another backstory that's very important is that when we come to America and. medallia's only one of the documents to be able to work and we are. Our integration process is still pending, if the usc usc is."
416.0,Provider,And how will three.
14282.0,Patient,"We came from, I was told. Okay, and the immigration from wasn't really, really long so in a nutshell, like when that was happening in our household. Where we just kind of live in a state of fear every day because my dad had a really bad temper and one of the things that. We children did to avoid his wrath was as soon as we see them coming you know coming home because he was the property manager of our of our complex. So his office was like right next door, you know so every one of the things that we would do is that every time we see it every time it turns five o'clock in the afternoon every season starting to walk back to our House, we would all run to our room just to avoid. Being in his presence, because God forbid, we say something wrong, we look at him wrong or you know he's just having a bad day. we'll pay for that you know so to prevent you know getting hurt or getting harassed you just run ballrooms and pretty much essentially lot of our stuff so we didn't have locks but we just stay there, you know, so we didn't deal with that."
416.0,Provider,"Did here, because your mom is fun."
14282.0,Patient,"And you did you mainly verbally abused and usually in front of us. But sometimes he did slapper in the face when. know how many times but. He just didn't have any restraint and my mom one of the things to that makes me eat her sometimes is that. One of the things that she will always tell us even to this day is you know he has a bad temper you have to have patience with him, you have to not say something that you that people will make him that. We had to accommodate for him and up to this day she still does that and i've me as well, just like kind of. explode like even my sister who did something like that typically recently and my sister is like what are you talking about why you know why do we have to do that he's the one who needs help not. need to change ourselves to accommodate this monster so."
416.0,Provider,Does anybody. Was anybody ever seriously injured like does anybody sustained injuries that you had to go to the hospital or anything like that.
14282.0,Patient,"No nothing like that we were so again in regards to. in regards to our immigration status we never did any of that stuff because we were scared of maybe getting depleted, or you know okay. Maybe they took away my dad who's going to provide for us no one. Like so we never asked for assistance, because we were scared of what might happen to us if you did so. No, we never went to the hospital anything like that of course never went to any mental health therapist."
416.0,Provider,Because they would have reported it.
14282.0,Patient,"Right, exactly, and you know we didn't want that to happen, because you know you know would start, we will have a place to stay with be become homeless, you know, keep us to jail so. I never we never did anything like that, and besides also my mom always said she always justify this action, saying like oh that's normal."
416.0,Provider,yeah. and which you. So i'm guessing CPS was never involved right.
14282.0,Patient,"No, no, there was a couple times so my brother and get called the COPs on him because i'm like that was using you know. In the intimidation and threats against my brother and my brother, called the COPs on him because he just wanted to come back home to the stuff I didn't want my dad there. You know, trying anything you know so."
416.0,Provider,"Are you wearing. A Sari yeah. Where are you in the birth order of things. Are you the youngest oldest okay. All right, and how is your relationship with your siblings now."
14282.0,Patient,"it's interesting because, for the longest number talked about this it wasn't until recently when an incident happened when I finally like talk to my siblings and then suddenly Their stories sorry that I didn't know you know and so. I didn't know how they felt because I left home pretty early to present extended anymore, and so did my brother, so I didn't know I didn't realize. That I was leaving my younger sister and I didn't realize. They didn't know what they went through recently when you start talking more about the stuff you know. So yeah. Okay."
416.0,Provider,sounds like you've old some lot of guilt about that.
14282.0,Patient,I do actually.
416.0,Provider,yeah yeah. And how was school for you growing up.
14282.0,Patient,"i'm cool. The other thing too that I learned about when I was. Usually. I don't want to use a fork defender but that's what I was reading all the time, to use a federal trigger but they say offender usually uses. A method for grooming and grooming, is when the groom themselves speed is nice, you know, like intelligent fiercely protective of others. As like a friend, you know and so growing up in school, you know all of my friends love. London and I never thought I never said anything to me about you know what my dad at home. And I still to this day, remember how my friends would say hey come to this party come over to my house and do all that stuff and i'll tell them all, I asked that and and of course last I. don't feel feel say why Would you ask me that you know we'd like as of saying like Why would you want, we can try, you know we can't you know, and then I will tell my friends, though, so I can't go. And then they'll get mad at me telling me you didn't ask him, he just the nicest guy in the world, I. This is like. i'm gonna tell them how you really want you know. Actually. Because they think I was. That my dad never say no, because they've met. So so that's one aspect of school, the other aspect of school is that. I like to dance and, one day, my dad. found out that I was dancing he didn't check the chat room again and for fade me dancing so I started doing is important and then. I also did kind of like a style of truancy where I just didn't Bible school, so I would hang out with my friends at their phones, where I felt safer. And I believe that I tried to really make sure that my grades are good other all boats there's times, where I would just get mad, and I would deliberately fail class just as kind of like. Just despite. My dad and my mom. I feel like i've been. allowed to go anywhere at all that type of study as well you're not really important. So yeah I think I was a. relatively good student."
416.0,Provider,And you. What what school you go into now.
14282.0,Patient,Now i'm at these assemblies.
416.0,Provider,Okay. And what are you studying.
14282.0,Patient,"international political science international relations and monitoring and. Human rights and migration, and also, hopefully, hopefully, if I have an ending also minor in law inspired me to want to continue. My work with like the child Advocacy Center and also with restorative justice, so I was. Doing."
416.0,Provider,"You remind me you remind me of someone I love very much which is my oldest son, who is at UCLA my major in in like almost the same stuff that you're majoring in. Oh that's amazing he is also half he's I adopted him he's half Filipino. buddy I know you like every time you say something like. wow you got a lot."
14282.0,Patient,"that's. Really cool yeah, what are the odds."
416.0,Provider,"No, no crazy right yeah. and his his birth parents were foster parents and then he ended up in the system and I used to be one of the directors of child protective services in San Francisco so i'm very familiar with child advocacy centers and. Santa Clara county and all of that yeah."
14282.0,Patient,Oh wow that's amazing.
416.0,Provider,"So yeah you're speaking my language, I know. um so yeah I know I know a lot about the child welfare world and a lot about what you're talking about um so okay. um in terms of mental health stuff. Has there ever been a time when you felt like so despondent and that you wanted to hurt yourself or and your life have you gotten to that point."
14282.0,Patient,"it's interesting because. I you know in high school I don't want to say it's normal to feel that way, but I know kind of like a few friends that have thought."
416.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
14282.0,Patient,"Somewhat suicidal you know and and I did at that time, but now that i'm older. When I feel helpless and being like everything is going wrong. The one thing that I almost did, and it was before I went on my pitch and my cousin talking yeah it was it was when the Syrian war was at its peak. And that's what I was just like I am done with my life I can't handle this anymore i'm going to Syria, I need to help some children that's that's where I go I don't say I need to end my life I need to go someplace you know so that was like. lovely That was the last time I felt like this is all ridiculous like instead of saying. That was the last time that was back in 2016."
416.0,Provider,"So tell me who is your I know you said, your husband is kind of your primary support right now, who would you consider like your inner circle like who do you go to when things feel terrible."
14282.0,Patient,"my sister my little sister's. Other like we've been slowly template to each other, which which made us closer, so I would turn it in so. I. Might two girlfriends that I can open up to have been there for me also. i'm one of the people that I thought was like my second mom she actually just have to wait two days ago so she was one of them also."
416.0,Provider,"Oh, my goodness i'm so sorry."
14282.0,Patient,"yeah it was really hard getting that means, because after. Again, why do you like, to be so fitting that I visit therapy we happen to she was one of the people, she was like my mom like. I could I can't talk to my own biological mom I can't there's no way, like every time I could talk to her, all I get in such cases and there's no support and nothing, even when I told her. I was going to believe me same take over she's like that spot she couldn't she couldn't rationally me when I told her, I was good, I got he didn't actually it all she just told me come home. You know, like no support whatsoever on that side, so I just don't even bother but sometimes I feel like one day she will, and I still continue to tell her all of these great stuff having a life and every single time alicia is consistent it's always a negative comment. And now. karmin passed away the person. You know. The positive. cheerleader."
416.0,Provider,A huge alas i'm so sorry. wow. you've been through a lot. that's a lot of grief grief there for sure.
14282.0,Patient,"yeah she was. It was it was like homelessness. She was one of those people that to be. No questions asked, and she knew about like my background I didn't know what documents at that time. She never saw me differently, whereas there was one friend that I told my situation to where I was in high school. So I never told anyone after that because I didn't I didn't want to be ostracized I didn't want to feel isolated. She knew accident, she found that accident toby and she treated me like I told her that I didn't like ice cream you don't like she didn't change."
416.0,Provider,As it should be yeah.
14282.0,Patient,"yeah it's that now that she's got such like, I feel like. yeah you."
416.0,Provider,"You seem like you're really good at um. that's sort of. How do I say this. sort of like forging for what you need in terms of support and love in your life, like you, you didn't get it from your family of origin, or at least from your parents. That support. But you've got your superpower seems to be. Finding it. In other places."
14282.0,Patient,"Like i'm just been lucky. And now that i'm older i'm like 30. All of them, I am more protective and. i'm here with food i've had in the circle, because I know what I planted people I don't want in there. So. I definitely want to search for them, you know, and when I find them I make sure that it's be at this stage, you know or ensure that foster relationships with them and that's the kind of environment, a lot of the earth."
416.0,Provider,"wow. Well yeah I mean I rarely see people who have that. That level of skill with that I i'm thrilled. To see it because it's going to be. I mean, it can be very restorative it can be very healing to be able to find what you need from other people and accept that love. Except that support and i'm i'm seeing a pattern that you do that, that you're able to kind of innate innately know what you need and find it and then accept it just very healthy it's very healthy skill, you have. it's good to see it's a lot to build on how about that it's a lot to build on um So what have I not asked you. How about any I think I probably know the answer this, but any drugs or alcohol history for you."
14282.0,Patient,know I always think about sorry i'm like going off on tangents every time you ask me questions.
416.0,Provider,Now you're doing.
14282.0,Patient,"Well that's things, but I was. still up to the stage I figure out. What my parents did right because my siblings and I. You know knock on wood never went back and. We didn't and I am trying like I can smooth executive about is that I didn't know what was that funny, so I would I get more stuff that's bad for me, you know, like i've already like dealing with this stuff at home, I don't want any more of this negativity I don't want any more of this. graph in my life so. I kind of tied it I I kind of gravitate towards good stuff I almost kind of like rabid so i've always associated. Sir, all that stuff with something that so i've always avoided it and also living in the Philippines there, for you know 11 plus years. Before coming to America, the way they portrayed people that drives me through that so I feel like that also got upgraded my head, so I never went that route."
416.0,Provider,"All right, good, well, that also will serve you well. So what questions do you have for me."
14282.0,Patient,"um. I guess, this is kind of like in a way, still."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
14282.0,Patient,"How how, what is the format like."
416.0,Provider,"One camp good great question. So typically what I do with folks I want to change your schedule around a little bit if it's possible to do that with you, and what we can look and see it because right now somehow you got scheduled for weekly 30 minute sessions which we can be can do, but it's not ideal. So I would rather do every other week for a longer. And, but anyway so maybe we can fix will fix that but so typically what I do with folks is we work on establishing goals we have some short term and some long term goals. And then, once those goals are in place will sort of chip away at them so usually the first part of the session we talked about. You know just what's been going on, and you fill me in on like any current stressors or anything that came up and then and then for a majority, the session we shift into kind of goals work and we talked about building skills to help you cope with things we talked about. I might challenge you a little bit on. on something that came up to think about it in a different way, or to challenge your own thoughts about it, or whatever. Or is there a skill, you can practice in this area that will help you so a lot of it is what we call cognitive behavioral therapy, which is very much about interrupting unhealthy thought patterns. Which i'm not detecting a ton of, and you, but I think you probably still have some that maybe would be helpful and for you, it sounds like there's a lot of trauma healing work that maybe needs to happen, and so we can talk about that. And, but anyway that kind of the major portion will be that kind of work and and then we usually set a goal for the next like little bit between sessions, because a lot of the. lot of the healing will actually happen outside of therapy right it's the work that you do in between the sessions it's amazing journaling that you've already started it's maybe some mindfulness work it's maybe some other things that will have you work on. And then yeah but i'm not going to be the one establishing your goals like they're your goals right there i'm just here to support you in that Mrs your journey, and I might have some ideas and suggestions like definitely what i'm hearing from you. More than anything, is is resolving past trauma. is finding peace with that and I don't know if that resonates for you, but i'm not hearing a lot of like. It sounds like your current. Coping skills are really healthy. You know you're you're you're very functional you're going to school you're in a in a marriage that sounds really happy, you know you have found your own support creature who's like there. You have it, you have a lot of you have a very healthy support system like there's a lot that you're doing, and that is very healthy coping for you, but it sounds like what's keeping you stuck is the stuff from your past. yeah so it sounds like that's going to be probably our focus. And so we can talk about. And I think you're in a good place to do that, because you, you are generally pretty stable, it sounds like like you're not you're not feeling suicidal you're not you know all over the place in that terms. Which is a great platform to do this kind of trauma work. That we might do. yeah, and so I I would think that that's where we would start, but I would love to hear anything from you about."
14282.0,Patient,I think if you're tired I agree yeah.
416.0,Provider,"Okay yeah. yeah. All right, well then that's what we'll do, and then we can also talk certainly a part of our goals could be about. sort of managing the interactions you do have with your parents. Within a cultural context because i'm not going to try and pretend like I understand everything about your culture and with the way you grow up i'll have some ideas and then you can say Julie, that would absolutely never work in my family or. Julie you're nuts, you do not understand my family, which is totally legit right so i'm going to rely on you i'm going to come up with some ideas and you're going to come up with some ideas and we're going to talk about like. finding ways to set Those sort of necessary boundaries to keep you healthy, while not totally destroying whatever remains of you know, the healthy parts of your relationships so."

A lot of the folks in that first of all they're just like a compassionate loving. group of people, but. um you definitely have a lot of folks in there, who have a lot of early childhood trauma as well."
14282.0,Patient,"And that's visit show, at all times when i'm going to be reading it, and I think i'm finally to this."
416.0,Provider,"Are you Okay, let me, let me see when you're scheduled to come next. So you are scheduled on next week. For that group yeah so um yeah this coming Tuesday. yeah that's right because the last one, you went to was on the 14th. yeah perfect. Alright, so let's talk about a schedule that works, and I can get rid of these appointments. So you right now, your schedule on the for the 11th and the 18th but just for 30 minute. sessions, so I think that, based on what you've told me, we could probably do a lot more in a longer session but less often and then with some stuff to practice in between. And if you're okay with that. So let me look on the fourth and maybe maybe we could start by just making that session on the fourth longer, let me see if I can, if I can do that. um. I can't but you could do so I need to work around your school schedule, I could do later that afternoon for a longer session. So, like I have. A one o'clock. That day. You want to do one o'clock that instead. haha I could."
14282.0,Patient,brush.
416.0,Provider,"130 is totally fine yeah. I could do that. And then. yeah actually that's perfect and then let's see so we've got the fourth and then two weeks from that would be the 18th so let me look at the 18th and see what we've got. I could do 130 that day, too, if you want. Does that work."
14282.0,Patient,Yes. Oh sorry. Sorry.
416.0,Provider,"Then. Two weeks from that is the November 1 and we can do that as well, if you want to do 130 then sure okay so, then we have our next three sessions scheduled that'll be perfect."
14282.0,Patient,"Sorry, that is November 1."
416.0,Provider,"November 1 yeah so the fourth of October the 18th of October and the first of November all at 130. awesome. Okay, and then um so yeah I think that'll be perfect and i'll have them cancel the other appointments. and So then we'll get to spend kind of a bigger chunk I think that would be more helpful.
