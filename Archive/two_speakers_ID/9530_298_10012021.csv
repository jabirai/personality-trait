Actual replacement and they're going to do it one more time, but they basically told me that you know it's not really going to alleviate any much pain and that we really just want to schedule you for the replacement so i'm just trying to prolong it because it's a two month. recovery and with you know my little one he's two and a half, and I just I have to find someone that's going to be able to help me with him. Because I just I know I can't chase them around. yeah i'm on crutches or whatever, all you know have i'm not sure what they would they give you."

You know I make sure you know, he does, and I make sure we have dinner and everything but throughout the day I find that i'm so focused on him that I tend to forget about myself forget to eat sometimes. But so i've been working on that and i've been trying to incorporate some. You know meditation and yoga back into my life because I used to doing it, it was really helpful before and. You know it's harder, with him, because he wants to do everything I do but um but I try to include him in it, and you know some days it works other days it doesn't but but yeah, so I think overall overall i'm feeling good and and i'm doing good."
