18351.0,Patient,Last night.
386.0,Provider,"Okay, three. Okay, when you're taking the medication are you placing it underneath your tongue letting it dissolve for 10 minutes and then spitting that excess saliva out or you swallowing."
18351.0,Patient,i'm sitting down.
386.0,Provider,"spitting it out, do you swish with water after you take the medication and spit that out as well."
18351.0,Patient,yeah i'm done i'm done it all my life on the before I came to the all when I was like oh I didn't and angry with me me me on this every day.
386.0,Provider,alrighty um so prior to coming to our office you were on 70 tex.
18351.0,Patient,Okay. Thanks.
386.0,Provider,Are you completely out of the medication now.
18351.0,Patient,yeah.
386.0,Provider,"zero. Okay. um what I can definitely do is send a message over to the prescribing physician to let Dr Marshall be aware that this is what. Previously you've been on what i'm going to do is i'm going to get things started for you in terms of being able to document the at. The intolerance, or the allergy reaction of those. symptoms that you had just reported and what what has to take places that we're going to end up needing either records. From the previous provider that you're seeing with the notation that you had an allergy reaction or allergic reaction or an intolerance, to the medication and then we would be able to switch you over to the sub you text usually what takes place. i'm not too sure exactly like how the prior authorization standpoint is in North Carolina. But what would take places that switching you over from suboxone. To step you text, it may require a prior authorization. And you may have to pay for the medication out of pocket until that is done our prior authorization processing usually takes once it's prescribed it's usually like 72 hours at Max. So you would need like. to purchase like out of pocket like a 3D supply. Or you can go without not recommended. Especially with with you know being on this medication long term and, and so what I can definitely do it, though."
18351.0,Patient,Is get a message back Marshall. I can get the I can get. My medicaid to reimburse me for it whenever you get.
386.0,Provider,"are usually you can make usually you can make arrangements with the pharmacy normally the majority of pharmacies what they'll do is they'll give you like a one time fill of like a short day supply for prior authorization processing to take place and then. You know, moving forward the prior authorization will have to take place, but i'm again I because I don't have. record of that i'm going to send a release of information. for you to sign if you haven't already for your previous provider that was prescribing them 70 texts that way we can get documented in."
18351.0,Patient,my previous year. I really have already done that.
386.0,Provider,"perfect and then I will just relay the message over to Dr Marshall requesting for changing medication due to intolerance, take a look here, it was it at coastal horizons. yeah okay. In the meantime, you can definitely take. over the counter like ginger that usually helps with najah. If you're having vomiting obviously just make sure you're staying hydrated the rash should clear up with you not taking the suboxone and then for headaches, I always recommend like a cold ice. Pack or something on the back of your neck in a warm and heating pad on your belly that should help with headaches and I know that it's only that's only you know natural things but, unfortunately, as just a medical assistant i'm not able to. prescribe anything. But what I am going to do is i'm going to send a message over to Dr Marshall to let her be aware and see what recommendations or she has if she if she ends up sending instead of you text for you, I will give you a phone call to let you know that that occurred. Prior to tomorrow's appointment, you do have an appointment tomorrow scheduled, so I would definitely just reiterate with her that you are having an intolerance, or an allergic reaction to the medication."
18351.0,Patient,Okay. To her now.
386.0,Provider,"it'll just be tomorrow during group you just send them a chat. message saying. yeah so but I am going to let her be aware i'm not going to transfer you anywhere but i'm going to let her be. aware and then I will give you a. phone call back if she has any recommendations for you, in the meantime."
18351.0,Patient,I will there be a prescription holding today or.
386.0,Provider,"I I can't say yes or no typically. You should realistically for the suboxone you should have medication, as it was last prescribed on 1228 so you should have medication to get you over and tend to group tomorrow i'm taking your last dose me just double check 12345. i'm doing a."
18351.0,Patient,Three day.
386.0,Provider,yeah so um. With that i'm not. able to because you have group tomorrow i'm not able to authorize any prescription renewals that would have to go through Dr Marshall but I will definitely request medication for you. Because it would be considered to be an early phil is there a reason why you're taking three a day versus the two times a day.
18351.0,Patient,"Because I mean I mean I don't know villains dig me and not stronger. Okay, that was even though."
