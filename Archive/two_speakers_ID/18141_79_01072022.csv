18141.0,Patient,yeah it can be fantastic.
79.0,Provider,"Okay, how can I best support you today. But anything you have that you have questions about or thoughts about what we talked about last time and with a. yeah for sure links that I sent over email. nfp naughty Can you see and hear me okay. connection is unstable, let me make sure everything's closed that can be I don't have I paid by the most expensive Internet and I don't know why it says that. Okay, maybe that will help. And how what any thoughts, you have a question."
18141.0,Patient,"No question but yeah question so. i've been trying to load food, no, no load all of the food. In I think is on Wednesday. I just ate a grip or first and my my day was ruling."
79.0,Provider,Okay.
18141.0,Patient,"yeah and continue on Thursday, Friday, until now, at this time. was a still in a steal my days to as usual. is to."
79.0,Provider,feel like it just keeps happening and cascading.
18141.0,Patient,"yeah and every every week i'm trying to make. made up my mind my mind, but it doesn't work, I cannot stand for over two days right now."
79.0,Provider,"Okay, and what is it you're trying to sustain is it what what what type of eating is it."
18141.0,Patient,Probably just eating with within range. Okay that's a basic I try to do.
79.0,Provider,And is there any long time periods without eating.
18141.0,Patient,Anything so.
79.0,Provider,"Okay, let me show you see if I got it. I got it open and ready for you, let me. Share screen. And you probably have seen this before I don't know, but the binge eating cycle."
18141.0,Patient,yeah.
79.0,Provider,you've seen this before something like it.
18141.0,Patient,I went through this whole cycle several times.
79.0,Provider,"like this, we see. Or what reality me."
18141.0,Patient,"I mean already with the release cycle, before, during and now okay yeah I figured that probably sometime that probably is probably i'm went through at this point."
79.0,Provider,"Okay, what what I want to do with this cycle is is right on it we're going to draw on it and. I don't know if I can kind of make it so that you can write on it to."
18141.0,Patient,me but.
79.0,Provider,yeah so what I want to do is draw out so basically exits you know where you can get out of the cycle. And so after each one of these let's just you know see explore what what are some maybe ways out and so like I don't know where you want to start but i'll just kind of draw the arrows and tell me which which spot maybe you think there might be an out. That you can think of.
18141.0,Patient,Probably in the seconds par.
79.0,Provider,After two right here.
18141.0,Patient,yeah because that's where i've been to heaven.
79.0,Provider,where's the text. text saying. I can't remember how to make it drop like write letters on it.
18141.0,Patient,"So, what are you trying to show me about the square."
79.0,Provider,"Well, so right in this so after two if you're having an overwhelming urge to eat what could you do in this in this spot to try to not get to the bench."
18141.0,Patient,yeah that's a par with therapy is trying to break in through and teach me some really useful tools to. to know. Oh God send the urge.
79.0,Provider,yeah okay.
18141.0,Patient,"All right. that's doable I think those two are doable. Especially during a time. crazy busy, and it just thing I can really dive into. But, but at this point. I don't know what really you know. yeah really upset with me and just keep it just keep happen happen. Every time I try to have a meal house. Out with my friends, I think my day. I think my days now ruined, but I think my day can only eat food. That is had a pod palatable food."
79.0,Provider,"yeah I wonder if, maybe I mean what you're talking about sounds like more like this area so when you go out to eat."
18141.0,Patient,and
79.0,Provider,"And you know, ignore the bench park here and just you know if you are out with friends and you're eating and it sounds like you're having feelings of being out of control and ashamed of what you're eating. Or maybe not."
18141.0,Patient,"But you're probably right. But I feel I feel I had a great time with my friends. Day yesterday, every time we. read out, we have guru or have good time, but I was having he just there is. There is the voice keeps me grinding to the binge because probably days for me to binge or eat whatever I want in which are grateful, as star star the star go, I want to achieve the next day. that's good to know."
79.0,Provider,"yeah and that's this cycle, right here, so let me go up here and let's do a. A one. Stop share. Right okay. So it sounds like you are having so you i'm going to draw kind of a sequence so you're you go out to eat. What to eat, and then you eat you choose food, how would you describe the food that you eat."
18141.0,Patient,"Before I have some control of probably look at label, probably the sort of things and probably reduce something great is a right now I just choose whatever."
79.0,Provider,"Okay. But during that time you're so happy, it sounds like you're having negative thoughts. Like something you shouldn't do choosing the food you want is something."
18141.0,Patient,"No now I mean. me it's none it's not negative thoughts I leave I could clarify it is I. I right now I just eat whatever I want, but. Only the meal."
79.0,Provider,yeah but it sounds like you have guilt.
18141.0,Patient,"I mean before, probably for right now it's okay. But. yeah I do think there is negative emotion in my mind, which caused me to feel um, no matter what I do, I will be a little control these days."
79.0,Provider,Okay okay. So a lot of a lot of self shame about it okay. And what I would call that is.
18141.0,Patient,"Like shamelessness gymnast but it's like. I want. If I in the food probably not going to eat, because if you if you do this way if you eat probably let's say 2008. yeah, for example. If you eat out with friends probably. say you go to his cheesecake factory. And you a 10 cheesecake you're not going to make the carrot goal when that day, except you don't need anything and everything in the rest of the day, there can be some sense. But yeah that's the whole point of trying to me if I. wish you know I like. Had it palatable for everyone likes it. Not not very. Not very tasty food has some health health benefit is our Muslim for our calorie dense so. So the day I just do I just eat whatever around. The Curry goes and just go for it."
79.0,Provider,So.
18141.0,Patient,I don't know if the detention or it says loss of control in this.
79.0,Provider,"One it sounds like is what i'm going to call for lack of a better word a diet rebel so you, you know you have an idea of what you think your diet should be like. And you have also inside you a rebel and because we all do we don't want to be told what to do you want to be independent, we don't want to have. No unless we're invested. In the rules."
18141.0,Patient,But the human body's made all these so I can apply to anyone.
79.0,Provider,"But what I do encourage is to have some rebellion inside you but call it, but I call this a rebel ally, because an ally helps."
18141.0,Patient,yeah.
79.0,Provider,interested in self preservation. And the diet rebel is just you know kind of what I call a stick it to the man. You know kind of like. um. I don't know what else how else to say. I mean you know generally swear words you know kind of my thing you know I angry i'm. not interested in self preservation. You just interested in that moment and getting what you want.
18141.0,Patient,I found I found them why I guess it's 10 times because there is no honey and the hour else any other issues bother me I can just focus on what i'm doing right now. Before I probably can. eat some food because I have tremendous extra activity.
79.0,Provider,Your day yeah but.
18141.0,Patient,"Right now brother, right now, the current output is not in March. Right now try to hold back a bit. they're. So I feel like. you're already. His trade is I tried to make an achievable goal. Without actually achieving it."
79.0,Provider,mm hmm But what if what if the goal is just. Go on a paper and your goal isn't considering your needs and your wants and if a person doesn't get some of their wants. Its life isn't worth living if you just you know kind of our light just following somebody else's program you naturally get angry and so that's why we have to incorporate some of the wants or we're just going to not care about the meal plan.
18141.0,Patient,"For so that's that's the thing. is sometimes i'm falling off the fan, but I want to get back to the track."
79.0,Provider,You.
18141.0,Patient,"Know fruits and vegetable becomes the demon right. Right so it's hard for me to go back to track on that day, so every time I do tires has to be a super super. Quiet today, no one bothers me know I already invited me go on to dinner, or what do whatever."
79.0,Provider,which has no fun that doesn't sound fun.
18141.0,Patient,yeah try to try to have some flexibility. But. he's just don't happen.
79.0,Provider,"Right. yeah let's do uh let's do what I want to. propose something to you, if I say the word calories. So calorie. What what instantly do you think about the term calories."
18141.0,Patient,Maurice energy nancy's fatigue. morrow moyes allergies lashes fatigue.
79.0,Provider,"yeah so it gets more energy. To little is the team. yeah and what's another thought what's the thought about. You know when you're trying to restrict your calories, why are our calories suddenly. At."
18141.0,Patient,"First, may ask, are we equalizing decreasing calorie equal, are you crazy and decrease calorie and we sweetie."
79.0,Provider,"I think the same thing. yeah yeah I mean it would pen but, in general, if you're trying to decrease salary, and that is restricting. Even if it's just a mental thing."
18141.0,Patient,yeah. yeah I tried to decrease probably a quarter. Which is less than 500 so I don't know if he's restricting but. Is planting.
79.0,Provider,it's extra it's not good for the body to to over eat a lot or to binge eat right and.
18141.0,Patient,"I told you that I tried to not let me by name, you realize i'm restrict. So we have now restrict here at all. But. The result is not our present."
79.0,Provider,"yeah. At some point, you feel like the calories are the end. Right and then also at other times the calories exactly what you want right if it changes."
18141.0,Patient,"color is probably another enemy at all, because everyone have to eat a certain amount to. Okay yeah the range. That property you if you're. not be in the range you're probably not going to live longer than most people."
79.0,Provider,Right right.
18141.0,Patient,"Totally yeah. yeah I totally realized my body weight body fat is. piling up and he must have some Sir must have some certain issues and. damage on my body, I certainly didn't realize that but I tried to manipulate the situation but it's for her."
79.0,Provider,"yeah and it really sounds like you have a big diet rebel and. If there's an expectation of needing to change your body part of US doesn't want to change. And the only way to achieve change is to first accept. Who, you are right now. And 200% thing i'm going to take care of who I am right now i'm a person who deserves care and i'm Okay, as I am, you know, maybe it's not my ideal maybe it's not what I thought it would be, but to give some radical acceptance as to who you are now. Or if you're if you're self feels like you know you're not okay not acceptable and that's going to cause the rebel to increase."
18141.0,Patient,"But right now probably feel worse than, then I was diety, to be honest."
79.0,Provider,Okay yeah what What do you mean by not going to stop share.
18141.0,Patient,"that's great So if you if you schools compensate the. The power which you feel you are trading last by yourself. I feel I feel that's worse than then i'm dialing hard. I try to get away really shredded, even though I feel fatigued, but there is the theme, you can look into the mirror and you probably feel a little bad feel better brother right now I lost the physique I lost the health I probably love lot more than I have when I should have right now. So. yeah okay so."
79.0,Provider,"You have some really, really good understanding of. calories and think Oh, I wonder, can you have your meal plan that you can share screen. you're trying."
18141.0,Patient,"I didn't know into I didn't know game, because I feel you feel ready ready quake. I can't tell you how much nacho say he committed bad so natural."
79.0,Provider,"But what, what is your. Like what you're trying to follow, do you have that to share with me."
18141.0,Patient,"I don't have certain like fat dies really were those to follow, but i'm just trying to achieve a goal and have. Baptist micronutrients that probably. Probably is and that's a that's a basic it can sustain okay."
79.0,Provider,"Okay, I want to get more specific so i'm. I want to get make sure I have a really good picture of it."
18141.0,Patient,You want your Oscar what kind of food oh what's Hypo micronutrients.
79.0,Provider,"yeah let me see i'll just share. So tell me when you when you think about you know when the plan that you're trying to follow. You know what does it look like, what do you feel like you should be eating for breakfast when you wake up what's the plan."
18141.0,Patient,"Probably breakfast actually some quick if I if I really need to hurry up to catch a bus. The right now I probably have some omelet. Which is OK, but. Sometimes OK, for me."
79.0,Provider,So you don't necessarily have a plan for breakfast.
18141.0,Patient,"Like what you're trying to have and. I don't have. I like I said last week, you had about."
79.0,Provider,Well let's create a plan is that okay.
18141.0,Patient,"yeah for sure, for your present."
79.0,Provider,Okay what's the best way I have lots of ways to do a meal plan you know from like kind of a plate method of having a plate how much do you sell a plate to exchanges to like servings. or just food groups what.
18141.0,Patient,"Users are a. Cartesian told me. Okay, though he told me how to use hand to measure the bait to basically measure the portal your food. which are always very interested and he told me, one thing is try to have some balanced diet might have some fat have some protein have some carbs. If you're meeting our one thing you're. Probably not going to feel satiated. But even though I asked some fat into that I have everything. is still a chance to overeat. i'm confused right now."
79.0,Provider,"Okay, so how much, how do you know how much to to try and force that, because what what usually what I have people do is for about two weeks. it's have them try and follow the meal plan and trying to eat three meals and three snacks throughout the day. And so I think it might be used to create that meal plan with you and see if you can follow it."
18141.0,Patient,yeah. it's.
79.0,Provider,"Like. You know how would I. mean when you go to eat me oh like if you have the oatmeal and I think, how do you know how much to do, is that, according to your accounts you kind of do well how much, but we know when my hand holder."
18141.0,Patient,"know those fully views are handy probably not going to it probably not going to. ask me right, like, I just want to handle for penis i'm a hand. That reward. kept thousand calories. Which is not a bad. Which is not bad, though, but it's always bad."
79.0,Provider,"Later, it just depends. Okay, so."
18141.0,Patient,"I have, I have for skill. or whiskey yeah yeah."
79.0,Provider,"Give me so like for tomorrow morning, what something you might have breakfast."
18141.0,Patient,"Tomorrow morning probably fewer than light because i'm probably having. I don't know. I guess I probably have. A lot of food to eat this more. This evening so. Tomorrow morning. Probably just a blood is a patient. With me as well, yes. So egg wash. The the leap we're worried."
79.0,Provider,So that liquid egg right.
18141.0,Patient,yeah which is. How much.
79.0,Provider,Do you measure it and put it in.
18141.0,Patient,Ireland measure.
79.0,Provider,This stuff.
18141.0,Patient,"I just. For into my pan probably. Yes, yeah probably. 300 milligram beers either."
79.0,Provider,What else do you put in it.
18141.0,Patient,Oh 300 grams yeah probably. and Probably sunset it.
79.0,Provider,Was it was.
18141.0,Patient,Hot peppers and mushrooms.
79.0,Provider,Anything else.
18141.0,Patient,yeah probably.
79.0,Provider,No meat or. He is.
18141.0,Patient,No problem or depend friends.
79.0,Provider,And we are cheap.
18141.0,Patient,"No, because probably I have some carbs and some pro days."
79.0,Provider,"Oh, I mean all of us here is protein and a time a better carbs in the veggies not very much. yeah so you need more carbohydrates from that. And you need fat. I mean, unless you saute the veggies though you know some butter or something I don't know."
18141.0,Patient,yeah probably you some oil.
79.0,Provider,"Okay, so the oil works. that's one thing about using a whole egg is that the egg yolk has fat in it, which is safe. So what's going to be your other carbohydrate for this breakfast."
18141.0,Patient,No probably not going to either doing the morning.
79.0,Provider,"Okay. But what about you did you look at the link that I sent you about the neural peptide why, if you're not eating enough carbohydrates, what it will do for your brain. Right so. I can't remember if I explained. It i'm going to stop here for a minute let. me pull that up for you, so we can. Look at that because it's important to understand. What happens when you don't eat enough carbohydrates, and how that can change your brain. Right now share screen. Okay, so this is one of the articles was that. Okay, so. You don't eat enough carbohydrates, your brain isn't happy it's not getting the glucose all your cells only take glucose and if you only eat fat and protein. That process takes a while to produce glucose it will eventually but it takes a while and so that's why it's important to eat carbohydrates at breakfast so that you get instant carbohydrate from your brain your brain creates this neuro peptide why. And this new peptide way initiate a very strong drive to create cravings for carbohydrates, which is very, very strong and it's just a survival instinct your your body and your brain is trying to protect itself."
18141.0,Patient,This is a duplicate myself if I try to add some some size of brad into my breakfast probably cream for more. feel probably fool but if I don't if I do. Probably create some more.
79.0,Provider,"Then we will never be able to stop this cycle and. If you don't eat enough carbohydrates it's going to make you crazy for carbohydrates, and then you eat more carbohydrates, and then you restrict. And then the brain creates all the neuro peptide why and then you eat or do you only way through is to to eat more carbohydrates you've got to put them throughout the day. For your your brain will be crazy for carbohydrates, if you eat steady amounts of carbohydrates, a day your brain will stabilize and won't be as crazy for carbohydrates. But it may take some time."
18141.0,Patient,"Okay. So. Probably three sides of toast. Okay, if I ever advertised probably doing the mo also there are eight but not tomorrow."
79.0,Provider,i'll happen not mad.
18141.0,Patient,Because I. I probably over either stay.
79.0,Provider,Oh. You have ready.
18141.0,Patient,What was that.
79.0,Provider,"Oh, my frozen again, do you have do you have bread."
18141.0,Patient,bread right now i'm ready for. yeah.
79.0,Provider,"yeah tomorrow, could you do one slice of toast just to help the brain."
18141.0,Patient,hundred percent.
79.0,Provider,Suppose just to feed your brain will help decrease the neuro peptide yy production okay.
18141.0,Patient,"what's worrying Tracy like. ice premier ice cream for carbohydrates, most of the time. I don't we realize a real lack of carbohydrates, even though I think i'm. consuming enough enough of them, but I never realized that."
79.0,Provider,"yeah, it has to be steady through the day it can't be just all at once. And the digestive system. puts all those carbohydrates away, and then it doesn't have access to them, it wants steady access. Okay, so what time, will you eat breakfast."
18141.0,Patient,Probably. 830. Okay yeah that's.
79.0,Provider,"Okay yeah that sounds good. Okay, then. When will you eat again."
18141.0,Patient,Probably.
79.0,Provider,say it again sorry.
18141.0,Patient,Your o'clock.
79.0,Provider,"11 303 o'clock oh that's too long. it's too much time here. You have to eat, at least. So three to four hours so like like 12 o'clock. Is when you need. yeah again."
18141.0,Patient,"Oh, I like to like to use the same food as use the same snack for lunch and. And the o'clock."
79.0,Provider,But you might get bored your brain might be bored you have to keep it interesting or you might set yourself up for benji and eating too much later.
18141.0,Patient,"All right, I have to walk during a time so I probably not able to eat and meal."
79.0,Provider,And I yeah. I don't know what's your work situation I don't know it.
18141.0,Patient,You have 123 and six to 10.
79.0,Provider,"Okay, and where do you work."
18141.0,Patient,coleman's ask on canvas.
79.0,Provider,"Okay, wait. 366 to. 10 in an office. Sorry, is it at home or in an Office like do you work okay. Can you eat there are you not allowed to eat."
18141.0,Patient,Probably quick snack is OK.
79.0,Provider,OK OK. i'm. gonna bring bring things.
18141.0,Patient,From the marquee.
79.0,Provider,"Okay yeah cuz you need I mean. For your lunch, you still need a fat carbs and protein."
18141.0,Patient,So protein bar probably be the best choice.
79.0,Provider,Okay. I mean doesn't have any fat in it.
18141.0,Patient,yeah 10 grams.
79.0,Provider,"Okay, how much carbs."
18141.0,Patient,Probably 23 grams.
79.0,Provider,"Okay that's pretty good, but then you need another snack."
18141.0,Patient,Consider I probably too.
79.0,Provider,mm hmm okay.
18141.0,Patient,"With some water, I think."
79.0,Provider,it's okay yeah. And then at three i'm going to say these you more like have two snacks instead of a lunch. And then you have. kind of your mid meal. at three okay so what's your mid meal at three going to look like.
18141.0,Patient,So right now i'm trying to go to the gym so yeah probably be the same.
79.0,Provider,Another protein bar.
18141.0,Patient,No favor. favor.
79.0,Provider,"Too much protein for one. And in your you'll be bored you're you'll be rebellious your diet rebel will say no, I don't want that, and it will make plans of. Eating other foods it it won't like it. Can you do Jim. Let me see. When you work at six. I mean you could do I mean if there's a different snacking to do or something like. Oh."
18141.0,Patient,What if you packed like oh. I will eat the rest Chris people are before I went to gym remember that.
79.0,Provider,Okay yeah. And how long will you work out for.
18141.0,Patient,Probably until six and I go.
79.0,Provider,Your work your work out till six.
18141.0,Patient,"New words are you ready for six years, I have to go back to the. office in oh."
79.0,Provider,So when do you eat. I cook a good meal.
18141.0,Patient,idea.
79.0,Provider,"Okay, this, this is the problem, this is definitely the problem, and let me here i'm going to. So see. we've got to get you eating eating more regularly through the day instead of all at once, so rule rule of threes is what I want you to try and do and. and your current your current system is not the rule of threes and three meals and three snacks today no more than three to five hours between meals and snacks so you would eat breakfast you know at nine lunch at 12 snack at to. You know dinner at five. snack at eight something like that, where, but you need three meals, a day, and right now, it sounds like you have maybe two meals one in the morning and one after work. let's go down here. So this this is kind of what what it should look like is you know you have a meal snack meal or snack."
18141.0,Patient,meal really trying to be a bodybuilder so things.
79.0,Provider,what's that.
18141.0,Patient,it's really like the. Sound server athletes.
79.0,Provider,"But it's just being human humans, this is how our insulin and hormonal response, this is how it wants to be what it wants us to eat and then stop and then he and then stop, and it goes through the day like that."
18141.0,Patient,"I know he's like kind of like psycho but always always if you. eat doing something spike because her and a slower story depends on when you eat, so it becomes apparent."
79.0,Provider,To.
18141.0,Patient,But right now I know my schedule is really mess up.
79.0,Provider,"If you don't do have those insulin Spikes then that neural peptide why will build up in your brain and make you crazy about to make you crazy, especially about carbohydrates, will make you overeat and binge and."
18141.0,Patient,"me how's currency, there are some medication or anything that can prevent you. probably reduce the urge to binge."
79.0,Provider,"yeah there are some that help a little bit, but. Trying to medicate your body when it's just trying to survive in a good way you know it's putting that neuro peptide why there because it wants to have steady steady dose of carbohydrates, not nothing, nothing, nothing and then. yeah for it."
18141.0,Patient,"Like. Sustainable carbohydrate intake during a day. that's not an issue, but the. quantity of meal, I really do have to probably contract my. Country my meal portion of your size, a little bit because I found. yeah we're starting probably become larger and larger wish increase the rallying the output, which means. Making more hungry so yeah I like to maybe use snack for to supplement the carbohydrate intake during the day, so if that makes sense."
79.0,Provider,"yeah you know I i'm okay with that I just and I do want your meals, to be moderate I don't want them to be huge meals."
18141.0,Patient,"No, no, no. You know, like terrible. Terrible."
79.0,Provider,Your brain is trying to get. It wants steady carbohydrate and if it's the same food your brain doesn't like that either it wants variety it doesn't want to eat.
18141.0,Patient,No problem.
79.0,Provider,"I you know I want you to have maybe two one to two protein bars a day, I would like to say, only one protein bar day and then he other foods."
18141.0,Patient,"i've heard you combine. The candy bar together in in the meal now trying to have to prune buying meal, because having to March a pro the my meal is not going to help them."
79.0,Provider,drive you.
18141.0,Patient,Know 20 grams is panty one meal.
79.0,Provider,"Right yeah, which is good. yeah you already know all that."
18141.0,Patient,So that probably increase the variety of meal.
79.0,Provider,"Okay let's go back to this, then so. So you have your breakfast and. Okay, so 12 o'clock you're going to have protein bar."

You know actual meal, where you take a break, and you sit and enjoy the food were meant to eat and sit and enjoy the food multiple times in the day. And I think you're missing out on that and it's causing you to be bingeing and food is just so so interesting by the end of the day.
