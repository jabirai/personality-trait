148.0,Provider,As part of our initial session together i'm just going to be asking you some questions today. Okay okay um I can get my questions pulled up here we go. hmm so let's start with what brings you to treatment and why now.
11554.0,Patient,"um so I have been. abusing. Like we'd be like opiates. i'm not even quite sure what they are, because I bought them off the street, I think that they're probably fat and all, to be honest. But that's what brought me to treatment and why now is because I had an incident where I kind of blacked out. While under the influence and. I wasn't all the way there so. my sister had come over to pick up my kids and seen me like that, and she had called the police and so so services, it was involved so. that's part of the reason why i'm seeking treatment."
148.0,Provider,"Okay okay um, can you tell me more. about your story with substances like when were you first exposed, how did it progress."
11554.0,Patient,"yeah so I was first exposed to substances at a young age 1516 um well, I mean How far are we talking like marijuana i'll call it type things to. My first experiences with any kind of us would be probably middle school 1213. Okay, when I first slow tweet or when drank it, you know snuck out and went to parties and stuff. But the harder drug use a first time I use prescription pills was when I was 16 1617 my my my oldest children's mom and I. Her dad had cancer, so he had like prescription pills, and he didn't take him take them all the time, so he did it and really noticed when some are gone and she would take them from them and. We we we started abusing oxy cotton at about 1617. So that's how it started, and then I had my battles with it off and on. At. was first time I ever did math. I struggled with that for about a couple years and then I got clean for a while, few years. And then I was introduced to heroin. And started using heroin. And then that was heroin and math and whatever else."
148.0,Provider,How old were you when you were introduced to heroin.
11554.0,Patient,1920.
148.0,Provider,"Okay, so same same time."
11554.0,Patient,"yeah some kind of time frame. And then I. I got as went to a rehab. And it was it was faith based, and it really helped and I was clean, for the last five years i've been cleaned up until well I had five years of sobriety up until just a couple years ago."
148.0,Provider,"mm hmm okay so have you, you said you went to a faith based rehab have you been in any other treatment for mental health or substance abuse prior to."
11554.0,Patient,"break yes. i've had my battles with mental health. I had also had I lost a child um So when I when I lost my son I I lost it for a while and just was in and out they had some I struggled a lot with self mutilation. Like. I have scars all over my body from burns and cuts and stuff that I had done. I guess in a way it was just like at the time I I never felt so much pain it internally and I just wasn't processing it right. And those moments that I felt physical pain. From the self harm was almost like an escape I don't know if you've probably heard this before you know talk to people that have shared similar experiences, but it's almost like that I almost became like. addicted to this self harm, because it was like. The moments that I was feeling that physical pain I wasn't thinking about how bad I heard inside, you know."
148.0,Provider,yeah yeah escape for you. Know emotional pain i'm very sorry for the loss of your son.
11554.0,Patient,"yeah it's been years I mean i've to help I mean you never really fully heal from from a loss like that, but you yeah I mean. I mean i've yeah."

11554.0,Patient,"Honestly, this last weekend just. i'm not like I don't have like a plan it's not like i'm still planning it, but the thoughts come, you know it's just. feels like Sometimes I feel like as if i'm it's almost like i'm feel like i'm waiting for my life to fall apart and. And, in a way it's like those thoughts come because I just want to just end it before it even gets that point, you know, like. I don't know how to explain it if that makes sense it's just like I feel like everything's falling apart and. I don't know."
148.0,Provider,"mm hmm. So you have thoughts around suicide, but you're not actively. You don't have a plan to hurt yourself. Okay okay um and when's the last time you ever had a plan."
11554.0,Patient,"um couple months ago. yeah. actually went out and suicide know. actually put it like I had actually tied to like a tire around my action. And with Stan was thinking of doing it like was on the i'd even like tested it like, but I just didn't go through it and. end up you know I can tie the knot and tear it up the letter mm hmm."
148.0,Provider,"um. Do you have a safety plan in place if those thoughts become really intense for you like somebody that you can call or suicide hotline or even if it's just bright heart right now. How do you feel about creating a plan to keep you safe. Okay, so do you have somebody a support person in your life that you could call."
11554.0,Patient,"I do have family, I do have my family and. As. As chaotic as my family, maybe at times that are supportive. And they do you love me. You know so."

11554.0,Patient,"i'm okay i'm just processing everything you know. i've been sober for the past few days, and so yeah obviously with that comes motions and things and. So i've been feeling a lot and then my wife's not here she left this weekend so. It makes a little bit harder, you know when you're here I didn't spend most of you can at home because it's didn't want to be here alone actually spent it with my family what. Is this yeah so i'm trying to try to. Take the bet the best as I can to make sure that I am saved you know. it's not easy, though we I just feel like the village. felt like the bad guy in my life in my own life, you know. When it comes to my children it comes to things like that I feel like. You know, you want to protect your kids you want to keep them for days and I feel like i'm. i'm the one that that that hurt them. So that's."
148.0,Provider,"that's painful to feel that way, because in reality it's. it's a disease right, these are symptoms of your disease coming out. yeah painful to feel the guilt and the weight of that."
11554.0,Patient,"It is, it is, are you know but it's part of it, I know is i've done. i've done this before and it's so it's not new to me recovery is not new to me but it's almost. Even though it's not new to me it makes it harder almost because I feel like. You know it's like it's another failure when when I was doing so well you know."
148.0,Provider,So you feel like you failed because you relapse.
11554.0,Patient,"Absolutely yeah. yeah I do and. it's cost me a lot, you know i'm. i'm in i'm in debt, now that I wasn't in before, to the point where I don't know if i'll be able to get out of it um. i've heard people you know my kids are no longer with me there with my sister. And I didn't do that it was forced me things hadn't come to that point it wasn't like to my children were forced out of my home, but I knew that they were. They were it was a distraction for them my recovery was a distraction, it was hard on them. or or even just you know being around, so I made the decision to allow them to live to go with my sister that way they could focus on school and it can focus I just don't want them to be you know. Tough to I don't want them to feel like they have to sacrifice being a kid or being you know doing anything. it's not they shouldn't have to make any decisions or have to you know this shouldn't be on them at all."
148.0,Provider,So I really hear that you're doing the best you can.
11554.0,Patient,yeah.
148.0,Provider,yeah.
11554.0,Patient,"yeah i'm trying but yeah. I know that a lot better up to this point. So there's obviously a lot of regrets, a lot of things that that i'm trying to work through right now. And you know."
148.0,Provider,"Self defeating thoughts. Okay okay we'll come back to that i'm. growing up what was your family life, like where your parents together."
11554.0,Patient,"No my mom and dad separated, when I was probably like six, I want to say so, I have some memories of when they were together. The ones I do have aren't really great to be honest, I know I have memories of them fighting. Memories of us, like all this kids behind hiding guy in the couch you know and. While they were fighting and things like that. But yeah so they were separated most of my life my mom had different boyfriends you know my dad every now and then would have a girlfriend but most the time was single. I don't think he ever really got over my mom but. That was kind of hard, because he would sometimes he was a drinker so he would get drunk and start crying and it was almost a lot of times like we were at a young age, like, I would have to console him, you know. yeah."
148.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
11554.0,Patient,"Most of my most of the time, I feel we were raised by my grandparents, most of the time, I mean my mom was from the whole my grandparents my mom shared at home. But my mom would be working most of the time, so we didn't really see her until like the weekend. seemed like when we were going, we were going to school and by the time I got home from school she had already left for work. So she worked like a swing shift so when she was home, we were sleeping and then now, so my grandparents were a big part of my life for most of my childhood okay."
148.0,Provider,"Okay, and and what's your relationship like, with your parents now."
11554.0,Patient,"Oh it's it's good I get along with my parents now. better now than I can say them will be ricky when I was a kid probably except for my mom not because it's not a bad relationship she's just worried about me, you know, so as far as I mean when I think about that relationship I just. A little bit more guilt and shame because I. Just feel like I put all that, on her, you know that actually cares and she doesn't want to see her children like this, you know and. So seeing the struggle that i'm in in the struggle that i'm going through is it's a lot on her to yeah. i'm not i'm not her only child that is struggling with with with with substance issues you know."
148.0,Provider,"Okay, that was actually going to be my next question did anybody else other than you mentioned your dad drink, other than your dad struggle with mental health or substance abuse."
11554.0,Patient,"yeah basically honestly most it all to my life. My mom. struggled with her own substance issues and on. my childhood and my teenage years. I don't think she even even as an adult she actually had relapsed as me being an adult I think so yeah she's so she's she has also struggled with it yeah my dad is still drinks, to this day he's never stopped you know. So. yeah my grandma. My grandma's gets a frantic so she struggled with with mental health issues. And then she started she also has her past she she abuse she had some drug abuse in the past as well, so. yeah definitely definitely."
148.0,Provider,"Okay, and then you mentioned, you had two sisters any other siblings besides your two sisters."
11554.0,Patient,Two sisters and three brothers.
148.0,Provider,Oh wow.
11554.0,Patient,we're a big family.
148.0,Provider,big family yeah okay let's say you're close with your sisters and how's your relationship with your brothers.
11554.0,Patient,hold on I. Think I don't want my phone and I want to plug it in real quick.
148.0,Provider,yeah no worries.
11554.0,Patient,"I guess the best way to describe my relationship with my brothers is it's not that we none of us have a bad relationship we're all, we all know, there's no bad feelings or there's no. Nothing like that. But. All of us boys I hate to say it kind of screwed that. up each one of us has our own struggles. my brother. My oldest brother Tommy is struggling with substance issues as well. heroin mass, I think. And then my other brother Bobby is, but he kind of follow my dad's footsteps and he's a heavy drinker, to the point where it's. it's it's going to kill him probably one day he's got bad circulation. doctors have told him that his liver he's only 33 I think and it's livers now. Not looking great. And then my my younger and I have a little brother Jonathan and Jonathan he doesn't he's not really I wouldn't say he he's not like a. On the plane same field, as we are with with substances are you guys drink every now and then and I think he smokes weed but he's not I wouldn't say he's like like we are, as far as like you know the addiction part of it, but he he still has its own problems. yeah. I guess reason why my sister's on my birthday support is there, probably the most stable, out of all of us, you know, like my sisters are. are both pretty stable and reasonable and no neither one of them do user training, can I never have no there's just. No okay okay."
148.0,Provider,Okay um. let's see here what was school like for you and how far did you complete.
11554.0,Patient,"um I completed school I completed my I got my high school diploma. school was okay. I there was times, where I was picked on and stuff. mainly because of the town, I came from so like I came from like us. It was it was like a resume it's not like a reservation like as far as like a like an Indian reservation, but it's like a. it's a reserve, or you know so it's like it's not like a fully developed town, it was like a smaller little town, you know and so kids when I was when I came to when that that that's town only went up to like fourth grade and then after fourth grade you would get busted into town. To corning and the kids in corning made fun of kids for my town they because they seen it as like a it was like a pork, you know, it was a poor community. And there was a lot of drug abuse and stuff in it, so I think that people like that that town and just you know so they would call me and bread and and things like that you know so. I started it, I was like i'm tempted fourth grade like I I was a great kid I didn't you know, I was kind of soft heart, I loved learning I left school and then, when I experienced bullying heavy my first time it kind of. changed something in me because i'd started getting in fights. yeah you get tired of what what other kids would say and and making fun of me, so I would start getting in fights and the bad thing was I was good at it, I didn't as much so, you know i'm not trying to know that it's not a bragging anyway, but. I learned that I can hold my own, and I was good at it so, then I stopped being afraid of kids or stop yeah and it was more just I just kind of hold in my heart. And then, after that I don't know I just kind of I was always smart. I I always got good grades, all the way up till I mean in middle school, I was an Honorable so I kept it, you know I. Up until high school. it's when I really stopped caring about school as much I. Well, I also so my freshman year my the summer, my freshman year I found out, I was going to be a foster so I had my first kid at 15. My oldest Ivan junior is will be 14 this year. And so, like you know. School for me was a lot different at that point, it wasn't about. The extra curricular activities or. or hanging out with my friends or this and that because I had to be a dad so my whole world just changed, you know and. That was obviously a lot, it was a lot of stress, there was a lot to deal with. I had helped for my family and obviously being a minor I wasn't able to live on my own or anything so. Little my mom but my ex didn't really get along so she and making a go live my dad so I had my my dad and my son. I actually had custody of my son when he was the baby I the mother his mother mothers struggled. With. Anger issues as well as substance issues. Most most of those hard substances that that was that I brought up, I was actually introduced to from their mother. She was the wall in her and she was introduced to him from her mother and that's the sad part you know. Her. To be honest, my son her mother actually talked us into having him at 14. So. I didn't realize it then but as an adult looking back I realized that that was face it was a form of abuse that I didn't even realize that I was being subjected to you, but yeah so. Coming from a home that I didn't have my dad in a home, I had a kind of a broken family always kind of wanted that I always wanted to have like a family, you know. I remember from a young age, oh I couldn't wait like to be a dad and my head, you know what I mean it was weird but so at 14 I was easily impressionable when I had these adults telling me convincing me at 14 that I was going to be able to. Have a baby and that they were going to help us and that we were going to. move in next door to them, there was the House next door was empty and that you know they were going to be able to move in next door and. Like so at 14 i'm i'm thinking, I have a chance at a family here and, in reality, I just really messed up my life, I made it I don't want to say that because I love my son. And I don't. he's not a mistake don't give you know to me i'll never say he's mistake, I mean. To be honest, it's probably one of the most greatest things i've ever done because one of the best kids of evernote he's amazing he's so busy but uh you know I know that I made a decision that that wasn't obviously ready to make and that caused a lot of problems. For her, and I know she's to this day she's in a mental institution like his mom she's she's ever really fully recovered, you know. We were subjected to a lot at a young age. I had our first kid at 15 and then we buried another at 17 so I mean, these were. I wasn't even in it at all, yet and i'm doing things you know that some people never do in their adult life, you know."
148.0,Provider,Right.
11554.0,Patient,"I didn't really I guess I didn't have a chance to be a kid I didn't have that adolescence, you know I didn't get to go and do the I mean I did I did. It is some of the experiences and stuff but it's the good stuff I mean like I didn't go to high school sports and you know or be part of the clubs and stuff I did when I was really younger pop Warner and stuff but. I don't know so I almost feel like in a way, I kind of. While I was trying to be a dad and trying to be an adult I was also having all these kid feelings and all these kids thoughts and still trying to be a man on my own, you know. And then I help and then like I mentioned, I was also struggling with drug at a young age at. So. yeah."
148.0,Provider,wow. What a story.
11554.0,Patient,"Tell me about it i've thought about it i've lived i've lived literally I times thought. i'm not I thought it like by like my life and just you know I there's been a lot it's been a lot, I feel like i've lived a lifetime and 29 years you know. And I thought, like before maybe like writing it all down, maybe doing like it cuz not just from not because myself and just more. me and if it can help anybody, you know what I mean, and this I know i'm not the only one who just had a kid at 15 or i'm not the only one who's young and it struggled with drugs or whatever you know i'm. i'm not i'm not saying i'm ready to do that now, but that that might be something I would like to do, eventually, even if I just did it for myself just to get it all out, you know."
148.0,Provider,I was just gonna say I think that could be extremely healing for you.
11554.0,Patient,"Do you think it might be and i've always loved to write like writings always been something that I. I enjoy like I really enjoy poems I used to write poems a lot and stuff um I guess you could say I was kind of like a kind of a hopeless romantic even at a young age when I really shouldn't have been there should have been focusing on so many other things, but I just. have always had like that heart, you know i've always had that loving heart or then it's sometimes it's just gets me in trouble as much as I hate to admit it does it gets me in trouble, I, too, trusting them to you know. yeah I did not expect all this to come out and. This in the first meeting sorry."
148.0,Provider,"That is okay, please do not apologize really appreciate you sharing so much with me yeah i'm Okay, I just have actually a couple questions left to did you ever serve in the military."

While I was there, they were with her there was my sister, and I was when my daughter was, I want to say two to three and my son was about seven or eight so they obviously like you know they're comfortable with her. So. I could tell that they were they were not happy and I don't know I feel like. them being here we're just adding more stress and more to all of us that that if my sister was willing and capable to take care of them for the time being, you know, then I just wanted them to be able to have that freedom."

But. it's like weird it's like it's like a double edged sword, because the same thing that makes me the person that I am because I care so much. But it's also the reason that i'm the hardest stop myself. Is because I care so much you know."
148.0,Provider,yeah.
11554.0,Patient,"i'm not the kind of guy that you won't see me i'm not the the attic that that's going to sit there and blame everybody else, or you know i'm not going to be. i've been selfish don't get me wrong i'm not saying i'm like i'm totally capable of being selfish could believe me, I have been. But i'm saying, but I mean it's like i'm not the kind that's gonna sit there and blame everybody else and, if anything, i'm i'm going to internalize it and it's just been harder on me, you know because."

That step into going back to services and. it's a heart, I feel like a lot of anxiety with that because I just feel like the made I step in the room everybody's going to be. Judging me, you know. I was a I was a prominent member of the Church, when I was sober. Like my last five years sobriety I did use groups I did send it I taught Sunday school I you know and so following like this feels. A little bit like oh like I let them down, and I feel like walking into there's going to be hard you know. So i've kind of been hesitant, but I also know it's it's gonna be it's something it's an important part of my recovery, I know that because it's my relationship with God is my by my biggest thing that helped me before no."
