13220.0,Patient,"yeah it was definitely. It was it was just because. i've been going through depression for through year already. The first time that I encountered like like like that I was really depressed was. almost like like 11 years ago when I had a miscarriage and then from there on I kind of had like a lot of health issues that have kind of like. become my priority versus other aspects of my life which I don't feel like I have been able to like so fulfilled and other aspects in it um, and so it also has caused a lot of like insecurities and and yeah like self esteem issues and stuff like that."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so you've been suffering with this for a while, have you ever gotten treatment with that before her for it."
13220.0,Patient,"As hot there before I was with the therapist with two therapists actually the first one, I. felt like I actually ever really connected with her like you know she was too scared like she gave me assignments and homework tonight it's just. I don't know like maybe with it was just an I don't know the second one was great, but she left about during Coco Coco bit. And so I kind of don't find it have anywhere to go, so, then I you know I kind of saw my options and also, I noticed that I was really. It was really hard for me to go to the meetings, sometimes, because sometimes I don't get to sleep, or sometimes I don't. Because I have like have begun some issues and so like them, I didn't make it to the meeting and because sleeping or something so, then I was like maybe online would be better so then. there's no excuse I just wake up and I just hop in like like at least I get to get to the the counseling session or something like that."
416.0,Provider,Oh yeah definitely.
13220.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"We are Tele health scrape for that have you been I mean other than yesterday, have you been finding it out. Okay, like the meeting getting to their appointments and stuff."

416.0,Provider,"When did the insomnia, start yeah."
13220.0,Patient,"I don't think i've always had insomnia um I think that. When I was younger was when I was anxious i'm so whenever we're going to travel whenever something big is going to happen, like a big first school or. kind of like like a job interview I don't sleep for a big test I don't sleep like i'm just terrified i'm gonna like sleeping or something, and so, but then it's just gotten worse, to the point where. A lot of that a lot of times I don't I don't really sleep really well so. it's just been getting worse as an adult."
416.0,Provider,And who do you live.
13220.0,Patient,"In your House so right now I am actually with my mom. My husband and I are separated i'm in her house, she has to have my cousins that she's racing, and so I live with them yeah. little bit crowded because i'm not supposed to be here."
416.0,Provider,yeah so you kind of how many bedrooms are there.
13220.0,Patient,there's only one. there's like two beds and yeah.
416.0,Provider,"So yeah you're a little crowded, is it an okay place for you, for like you know what peppers hash. i'm sorry, no. Is it okay like are you safe or just you know just a little uncomfortable or what's the."
13220.0,Patient,"um are you saved I just feel comfortable just because I don't want to intrude. into their space like. i'm sure if i'm like okay well I you know there's like no privacy as it is for like another person does change a lot, and my actually my cousins just were visiting from Mexico, so we were really three more people in here, we were a lot of people. Like a big slumber party it's fun at first, but. This is like. I know I just I, like my own personal time so I i've noticed that sometimes. I just I just stay in my car for hours, just because I don't I don't feel I don't just don't want to come back home. it's not that it's bad plays it's unsafe is just. Maybe I just kind of. I want my own space like I want my own my own. thing yeah."
416.0,Provider,How long have you been with your mom at that house.
13220.0,Patient,"we've been here since I have been I just moved. Here in October. it's been almost a year. yeah and so, but I was in here like I we we moved for six months to Mexico, well, it was indication, but we were like literally living out there for six months during Kovac um and so over there was worse because over there there's like 10 people and. But there's there's like three bedrooms but. yeah yeah yeah a lot of people. have a big family."
416.0,Provider,yeah yeah seems like it yeah and you mentioned that you and your husband are separated.
13220.0,Patient,"yeah we were about that. um. I had. issues with his mom. So I quit my job, I was, I was a teacher assistant and I quit my job and I. To help him out because he started his business. So he does with fire Peters and it's a family business so his mom it's you know, help them out as well, and his dad helped them out and so anyways Okay, we started and then like his mom it has already a person who has very difficult. personality, but i've like I kind of like was able to like do with it for all this time, but then she said started seeing things about me that personally attacked me. And so, that is where it just kind of started to change the whole dynamic of the good work, and then we got into several arguments and there's just things just didn't get better to just started to escalate. And one day I just quit and they left and the problem is that we were living with them, so, then I kind of don't feel comfortable. still living with them and we were kind of like a year contract, and so I just moved and I kind of been waiting for my husband to decide where we're going to do from here because I really don't know."
416.0,Provider,What do you want.
13220.0,Patient,"Well, ideally, you know I think I would love us to have a place of our own um. He is able to afford it, because he pays for the whole rent at his parents house it's a two bedroom, but I feel like what makes him very hesitant to say he doesn't want to leave his parents. Because he doesn't want like he wants to help them as much as possible, but obviously that's not a possibility anymore, because his mom and I don't get along so either it's gonna be here, he states restraints or regime was not with me so."
416.0,Provider,it's a tough position to be in.
13220.0,Patient,A prior life I just. i'm kind of holding on.
416.0,Provider,"You can try as much as you want. you're out. Oh, oh sorry sorry. Sorry. My house and my dog went crazy. um. yeah I mean you're going through a lot."
13220.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,so hard to train How long have you and your husband been together.
13220.0,Patient,"we've been together oh my God so many years i'm just like 19 maybe 12 years i'm still we've been together for a long like boyfriend and girlfriend. We dated for a year we kind of stopped talking for six months we went back together we reported in girlfriend we've asked it. Together, like seven years until we got married and before that we were living together for like a year and so it's been a long, like huge big part of my life, and so, even just considering to force like. it's just not like I don't know yeah I just don't want to get to the point, but like I feel like he hasn't done anything to change the situation and it doesn't make sense of how you cannot live with your spouse, you know. So. I have that I have all these health issues that I worry about it so it's just not it hasn't been it hasn't been funny here."
416.0,Provider,"No, I see that. Wait, can you tell me any more about your health."
13220.0,Patient,"Issues yeah. So that's another one. um so since my miscarriage after my miscarriage they found. assist in my right ovary that was removed, but the painting and go away, so I just kept going to doctors and the sister hurting you know I sound really bad cramps and they don't go away like it's porcelain crowns. So they found that I had a lot of vibrates i'm actually it took forever for them to get another surgery, going so I got very impatient, so I decided to go to Mexico. When my grandma was from and then just got surgery there with the agenda ecologist and I had my whole family take care of me and then. i'm happy to stay and just get surgery recover, so they remove the fibroids within two years, they came back even bigger than before. So my uterus is super big it's like more than 14 centimeters so lot, and so I got a gastric bypass surgery i'm hoping that lucien rate. Maybe would diminish the amount of fibroids and then I could try to get pregnant and because it seems like I have this hormone that produces the fibroids and it's just going to have a lot of more issues and so recently, they just found out that I have another cysts on the left side. The fibers are just too much, and so I could either take them out for could have a hysterectomy and it seems like now, even if I would try to get pregnant, it would be very risky. And the possibilities is i've had many surgeries and then being successful or low like i've had other procedures like D mcs and stuff throughout the way i've tried every. Like birth control method possible and it's just nothing has helped So if I were to get a hysterectomy that's kind of like. Also, another thing like I just won't be able to have children ever like not myself and so that's always been something I wanted and so yeah so that's added to the whole stressor and grieving with that and. Having a lot of grief. into some it to deal with it so it's. Just. been is easy you. don't feel like it has does cost me to kind of hate my life and. and honestly, sometimes I just think it would be better off dead having to deal with all this."
416.0,Provider,yeah it's a lot of grief in her all at once. Especially when you're kind of already prone to some depression.
13220.0,Patient,"and her just have been in and out of the hospitals, because of my fibroids it causes like a lot of heavy bleeding some always bleeding like. I was bleeding from like October, all the way to April non stop, and all this hemorrhages and, and so my homework globe in has been really low like even as low as 4.5 and so. I just had."
416.0,Provider,feel like crap.
13220.0,Patient,"I feel it really crappy I was filled with energy, I always feel. tired and and I just some does I can't even have any food down it's part of like the cost is national, but it's also because they got the gastric bypass, so it hasn't helped you know it has actually made things first and it's like the only reason why I got. To gastric bypass was to be able to get pregnant to feel better to be healthier and he just hasn't happened. I mean. lost my. 90 pounds but. It just does not, why did it. It should be proud or happy about it but i'm just so many care."
416.0,Provider,uh huh. yeah. it's not not. Not the way you wanted anything to work out so you've got a lot of physical stuff going on you've got a lot of grief. Worrying and stuff with your with your husband. And then there's a part of you that also doesn't feel all that comfortable where you are where you're living.
13220.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and it's like I didn't I just have all these health issues, I didn't finish my career. And so I also feel like I don't have that economic i'm not independent economically, so I can't. I can't. I feel like stuck a lot of times like I can't move forward. And if anybody to get to to like try to finish like. Part of the thing that i'm finished to graduate it's like I can't even concentrate I can get started. I just I got I got like the antidepressant and then got it in liquid form because of my my gastric bypass surgery. And I just feel like also like it's scary like I haven't even gotten myself to start drinking it some scared to depend on something but i'm also know, like, if I could, if it would help me why not. yeah I just don't know why why hasn't started drinking."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so I think it's important that you do. Especially if you're having some suicidal thoughts. And it's going to be important that we that we get you going on, that are you are you open to that."

To maybe drive and hit a tree or something, and maybe I could get really hurt or something I don't know that's thinking um I just found out that my husband was cheating on knees, so I wasn't in a good place."
416.0,Provider,"And then, what brought you out of that."
13220.0,Patient,I call my best friend um. I don't want to hurt or note the whole story either. But. I just I just caught. It just I just know she was someone to call.
416.0,Provider,And how was she able to. support you.
13220.0,Patient,"He was she was she talked to me. You know, and then after that um I call the hotline and. And that made me feel better and I went home. And, and then I just. I just worked on myself, then. With those thoughts. yeah."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, good so you were able to reach out when was last time you had any suicidal thoughts I mean cuz you mentioned some a little earlier in our discussion on this last time you had any real suicidal thoughts."
13220.0,Patient,"The main when I was really bad and really thinking of suicide, I thought was maybe around me made tune. And I was feeling that I missed. I was having a lot of issues with my husband. And I kind of had let all it's like my feeling is just pile up and then I I wasn't feeling physically okay you there, I was feeling really bad. So I called I called my my told my doctor my my my my general physician. They didn't have a therapist on site, so they gave me they told me to call and they care and find a new therapist and, and so I called and he gave me a few numbers number, I came through with bright card and. Oh so then that day, they were talking to me and there his name like how I was feeling, and so there was a hotline. And, and then that same day I ended up going to the emergency room, and so I know that they were giving me antidepressants when I was there, because I was hospitalized for like three days, three days for four days. And so I was I started to take. Data presence there, but then they were giving it to me. So then that's why I was taking it versus here like I have to actually take it myself and. I don't know why I felt Okay, when I came out um, but I still feel like. Make sometimes I just don't want to do with any of this sometimes. i'm just tired and I avoid everything and I avoid everyone they're really just prefer being alone in my car."
416.0,Provider,"Not top. yeah yeah. So I really, really want to make sure that you stay on top of that medication okay. So you got your alarm set. Yes, okay and. I think you're going to feel some benefits from it. I want you to keep coming to the group. When when you've had therapy in the past was do you happen to know like what kind of therapy, it was was it were you working on some of the stuff that we've talked about in groups at all."
13220.0,Patient,"um no I remember talking a lot, and there was a lot of like us like Homer it's like reframing. Like positive thinking. A lot of. gave her all. yeah I think that's what it was yeah."
416.0,Provider,"yeah sounds like a lot of cognitive behavioral good well i'm going to do some of that too and and then a mix of other things as well, and so the tell me about any drugs or alcohol like do you drink at all, are you smoke marijuana anything."
13220.0,Patient,"No well because of my gastric bypass I can't drink for a year. I. Heavy alcohol drinker more of a social one, but in the Hispanic culture is all the time, pretty much because there's just always social drinking but. um no I don't have like an opposite problem right and I thought, but I can't drink anyways because of the whole year of the gastric bypass and I had don't really do trips like I don't do marijuana or anything like that."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, and what about in your family and who so tell me a little bit about growing up, you mentioned, Mexico, you mentioned your House now like. Where did you grow up and who was in your House."
13220.0,Patient,"So I always born and raised here in California. My mom does have. Like her documents so she could come in and out of the country, as you, please, so we were always like visiting Mexico, so I. do have a lot of family out there actually half of my family moved back they even though they didn't have to like just want to. And so that's so now like, I feel like kind of my mom and I kind of stayed here a little bit ourselves but um. But yeah I was just been me my mom i'm an only child and my mom's a single parent and then my dad was out of the picture, probably by the time was four and he has been there, but it hasn't been. The best Father that he could be and I don't know like right now, I think, as an older and i'm having all this health issues he has tried to do a lot of immense and he is. constantly calling me and checking up on my house and and trying to be there now and then I also feel like I helped them a lot, too, so I don't know if it's because i'm helping him or generally he is he wants to be there for me. And so it's just really small like immediate families just my mom and me, and so that also was a codependent relationship, since the start it's been like that, since forever, which is really bad for both of us actually."
416.0,Provider,Can you tell me more about that.
13220.0,Patient,"So I feel like. Like my mom depends a lot of me and I depend on my mom and it's been like little kids a good that we love each other it's get that we help it to them and we're attached, but. It also like when I got married for my life, it was really hard for her and. She doesn't sometimes he doesn't let me do things or experienced opportunities, because she doesn't want to let go of me like I went to college close by to the House, because I don't want to leave her alone and and I just kind of. You know just I felt like sometimes. Now that i'm sick she worries so so so very much. And it doesn't help her and her anxiety because she does suffer from anxiety. Panic attacks and. It just I feel bad like I don't want to show that i'm sick because i'm afraid that they're going to be worried if I fail, all the time, so everybody's like. paranoid and it's like also has caused people like don't go out heavier don't leave like also they don't leave you want me to leave the House because they don't know what something could happen to me outside and I get it, but I also don't want to be stuck here all the time. And so it's certain things like that, and I feel like. My mom also doesn't let me do anything in the House, she wants to do everything for me and that's the best way or best for her to show me that she cares. They call cook for you or don't worry about cleaning or don't worry out i'll grab this for you and I love and I appreciate that, but I also have to be independent and they also have to do my own things. and be able to cook my own food and then I don't want like a comment later saying like I don't do anything or people thinking that I don't do anything and. So it just kind of that's by has become a really bad. codependent relationship, but also, I mean, I have to make it sound like I make an initiative to try to do more stuff either. Because, maybe I already know she's going to do it and so that also doesn't help me. And so I don't so maybe it wasn't because of her what I be taking care of myself Would I be eating what i'd be. Doing basic things are on a battle, no."
416.0,Provider,"Okay. And so, and then your friends or any of that."
13220.0,Patient,And what about friends i'm sorry.
416.0,Provider,Like do you have a social support system outside of your family with close friends or.
13220.0,Patient,"I have, I. have my best friends, since I was 11 years old. and We we do try to have. go out and eat and we do try to do things I know, but I know like lately they've been super busy because now, they have children and and they have young children and then it's really hard to just get together, or we they're all like. They all have to read it. Now, like pretty successful and and so sometimes they're busy too, and so it's sometimes it's hard to arrange it. So they're supportive but, like, I think I mentioned in the group, like. it's like it's true like you don't you don't want to talk about your weaknesses and and what they're doing well, like you, don't want to go and be like oh i'm not doing well, like I didn't finish my Grad program like it's. Just don't still so does I don't feel like I want to tell them what i'm going through now that I can't know they would hear me it's just. wanted to say."
416.0,Provider,"The word that comes to mind, maybe is shame to the family."
13220.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah like like I think I have enough make comments like like i'm not where I want to be in life, they come not even close it is not where I thought it would be in life. Right now. And I mean that they don't even know, like my marital problems per se like they don't know how bad it is. And they."
416.0,Provider,can feel really isolated when you don't feel like you have a lot of people to understand you to really. I heard that you were on stripe or did you get on the discord.
13220.0,Patient,"I did I did. I reason I think I cannot pronounce it huey. You do i'm sorry um yeah so who coordinated thought and and he, like got us all in there. And it's pretty quiet it's not as active as I thought it could happen."
416.0,Provider,Right. I mean i'm.
13220.0,Patient,connery it keeps it moving because he's always sharing.
416.0,Provider,connors okay okay cool.
13220.0,Patient,"I don't know usually you share or not, but he's he shares."
416.0,Provider,"Well, good good i'm glad you guys are all connected, I feel like that would be a place for people, probably could support you and understand if you wanted to choose to use that."
13220.0,Patient,"yeah i'm here, told me to to to share right but it's I haven't really shared um I just I just feel like Sometimes I feel like what i've gone through it's not that important."
416.0,Provider,"But it is. it's very important because you're important. Before you. Before when you were in Grad school What was it, you were hoping to do when you got done with it."
13220.0,Patient,"So I got my bachelor's degree in child adolescent development, so I knew I wanted to work with children. I like psychology so, then I kind of combine both and I went to Grad school for school psychology and was a went into the programming in 2014 then in that year I got my first surgery, then that second year, I had to repeat it, because I was under a lot of meds for the name and. Then they for me that as. I was like where they wanted me to be like analyzing the reports and reading all that stuff, and so I had to be take that second year, and so that was like. A big like big thing for me, because it really hurt my confidence um and then I did the second year, I did the third year but I didn't finish what it's called. Like my comps which is like like seven report that I have to write and then I have to then memorize and then write them in a computer it's like a comprehensive on an."
416.0,Provider,APP.
13220.0,Patient,"For that, but I didn't finish that so therefore I don't have my license and the only have two more years left because of all my health issues, I kind of like. Reading and having to take that second year, like it has made, like that long time like I only have eight years to finish, and so that's a little bit of pressure for me to thinking about yeah to get back, but I mean it's, not that I don't want to is just that I haven't gone into it."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, that makes sense."
13220.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"All right. So, is that a goal of yours to to get back to that at some point."
