Like set like girlfriend boyfriend because she's coming out of an abusive relationship and she has two kids and she was just saying she's not really in a place to. enter it and I, and I was coming I kind of felt the same way, I was going through stuff and I just still was depressed and I just we both agreed that we're not really in a place to. Like make that commitment, but we just we did enjoy spending time together and we ended up hanging out a lot so. I mean living together there's a lot, but it was good until like about a month ago, when you start getting upset over little things and trying to kick me out and turn my stuff aside and not kinds of crazy stuff."
760.0,Provider,"After me how you process your your heart emotions your difficult emotions do, what do you do you know because."
16580.0,Patient,Sometimes I write in a journal.
760.0,Provider,You think that helps.

760.0,Provider,"Okay, yes."
16580.0,Patient,Lots of just processing your head gets everything gets mixed up.
760.0,Provider,So yeah. Emotions don't necessarily have to be logical. But they need to be expressed. So do you think you still need to do you think you were able to grieve the loss of your father.
16580.0,Patient,"i'm not really in because it was like. I mean I flew home for the funeral and I was there for like five days after that Pennsylvania, and I came back to California and there's like three days after I got back there's one of my girlfriend wanted to see other people, and that was kind of."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so so you. And you were living with your girlfriend at that time."
16580.0,Patient,"Now I was living by myself children places so it's kind of just said after she like wanted to see other people, we were still friends, I mean I mean. Ideally I mean it was tough at first, I mean but, at the time, like, I mean they really have anyone else to talk to, so it was like. And then, that I don't really have many friends, I mean after spending my cousin but then he moved to the desert, so it really and there was coronavirus I was locked down and. isolation and just."
760.0,Provider,"lot of isolation, so there was really nobody to talk to."
16580.0,Patient,"yeah so we so we tried to be friends and that didn't work out and then it's just kind of took a turn and she but I mean the day after she wanted to see other people, she was already seen someone else, and I mean obviously that was difficult. And, and she was saying, she might be friends, whatever and then, and then I have gotten upset over a couple things and I said some some not nice emails to the guy. And I mean I apologize and tell them, it really wasn't anything with him, which is upset with her, but. I really threaten them but I definitely wasn't nice about certain things and I guess, he was frightened by that and, as my ex ended up filing for a restraining order which is crazy but it's difficult. crazy."

760.0,Provider,"And then, a handyman business okay."
16580.0,Patient,"yeah and that was decent I mean I enjoyed that for a while and then coronavirus can everyone cancer, then this is a lot of stuff with my. dad my ex and. I kinda was afraid to violate that restraining order again, so I just kind of let my car got towed at the time I was just a precedent care I just lets you on the street and kept getting tickets so finally told it. And then I had finally gotten another car and then my landlord had gotten that one so. I think I couldn't get back because I just got a friend, and I was on the way to the dmv that day but work, I told to update the registration and when I went out to leave the car was gone. So it's a dmv but the paperwork was in the corner couldn't get back okay so."

16580.0,Patient,"um no not not really I mean I was raised by my grandparents. time I was like one or whatever there's a brief period of conflict with my my biological mother and that wasn't really great, but I don't think it really bothered me no I don't.

760.0,Provider,What with what substance did they use.
16580.0,Patient,"I mean alcohol. I think I mean probably everything I think my mind is up everything, maybe I don't know that my dad I don't know too much, but I know that, because of drugs and. I know I see I see my biological mom overdose like one. Time and that was that was the end of me my brother standing here."

16580.0,Patient,Oh i'm sorry when I say my past specimen my grandpa that raised me.
760.0,Provider,"Okay. So, how was your relationship with your grandparents, so they were your parents in your mind. yeah the way you felt."
16580.0,Patient,So what was it a positive relationship with them.
760.0,Provider,yeah okay. and your biological parents do you see them now.
16580.0,Patient,"When my mom passed then or 2000 2006 I think 2007. But I didn't know her or no. And I knew my dad but anyway, like I don't really hate on that, like all right. I don't really respect them, I don't I don't hate them."
760.0,Provider,They don't really interact with him.
16580.0,Patient,"not really to message me on Facebook, from time to time i'll answer, sometimes, but I really miss."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right all right any other childhood experiences that were traumatic that you remember, maybe at school or any anywhere else."
16580.0,Patient,know.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right. How about medications to take medications for anything."
16580.0,Patient,"I used to take adderall from like I guess in time for my second grade to like was like 17 or something. So that was a long period of taking that but since I turned 18 and kind of a kind of just chose not to do it, but I don't know I just didn't like taking it every morning but. Maybe it was, I think I don't. I just remember as a kid not wanting to feel like I needed to take medications I thought I was fine, but maybe I was a little bit hyper V was a little bit easily distracted I don't know. So maybe maybe they're right maybe it's hard to be like stay focused on one thing I guess mine kind of wanders, but I think that happens, everybody I don't know."
760.0,Provider,"When you're a kid you only have so much ability to focus, because you know the brain still grows until the age of like 2425 so you know we we develop focus over you know years living. But on top of that, when we deal with difficult experiences in life or traumatic things or things that cause us to grieve, then I think it's easy to kind of lose focus then to. Because your mind is like you're hurting your emotions kind of block that and becomes important, especially if you're living this. In this way of being depressed a lot and it weighs on you and take your mind kind of goes there a lot of the time. So do you think that depression is, do you think it stops you in your daily life today to move to move forward and perhaps find work, I know you have the barrier of not having the transportation. But there are. I know in long beach, there has to be some bus systems which i'm i'm know is far from ideal, but it's not impossible. No, do you think the depression stops you from moving forward in those areas."
16580.0,Patient,"yeah I think I think to depression definitely choose she stuck in that motivated and morning. it's like it's like hard to sometimes just keep going or even do for even find like enjoyment and things that he's doing so it's kind of just like. When all that happens, and there was a lot of stress with my girlfriend who I mean I did care about and she I mean i'm sort of like to keep. A friendship with, and she was saying the same thing, and there was just like this, she was saying one thing promising these things, and then like the next day, it would be like blocking me and like. Whatever just ignore me and then it was promised to be friends forever and how important it was and then two days later it's file a restraining order and so God. I don't I don't know what the heck she's thinking, but it was just it was just and then after that it was just like. To stuck on like I couldn't like I would have been nice to just if I could have just forgotten about it, but then I had to. deal with trying to prove her lies in court wrongs to fight the restraining order so it was like I had to just be focused on it all the time and trying to find evidence and just. Just dwell on it when it really would have been best to just be able to forget about it or think about other things. But just."
760.0,Provider,"yeah just kind of break it let the relationship die out, and so, so what happened with that you need legal problems that you're still dealing with."
16580.0,Patient,"yeah there's I mean, I have some bench warrant out for violating the restraining order one was, I mean I didn't even know, there was a restraining order. And when you're trying to talk to her and got arrested for that I knew there was a restraining order I didn't know, I was doing anything wrong then I got a couple more the same charges was violating the court order for a Center text messages are trying to call it."
760.0,Provider,Okay.
16580.0,Patient,"I mean I just that's just ridiculous to me, and they really shouldn't have been there for a stranger in the first place, and I think. Any I don't I don't understand how a judge could craft a restraining order, because there was no threat or any violence or anything. towards her at all, I mean I loved her still ever never heard her but it's just I guess she was forced to do, she said she was forced to do it. She felt forced to do is what she says, I talked to her after she filed at once she said she was sorry and she just felt like she had to go through with it, because everyone was expecting it to which met her. New boyfriend was telling her that she needs to do it if they wanted to be together, which I understand but it's just it's just extreme. And it's just it was hurtful and I don't think the judge would even granted it because I think I. did a good job, proving her claim is wrong, but the problem is our mother was there and her mother is the chief of staff for the long beach district attorney's office and I think that definitely had a lot of impact on the judge's. decision because I mean there's she didn't come with any evidence or proof or anything she didn't even say anything until all our text messages are brought improved her to be a liar but. Yes, that's in the past, now, but I still got the charges to deal with at some point."
760.0,Provider,yeah so still waiting on you know so you've got a lot of things on your plate right now yeah perhaps this is affecting the way you're feeling to. You think it's affecting your level of stress as well.
16580.0,Patient,"um I think that I think that was the cause of a lot of my stress and probably for a long time, maybe like. Like four months afterwards and months and months, but I don't think that's the leading cause now I think that's kind of like in the past, now now it's just been I mean to Lady that I was renting I was renting like a back room from like a. finished garage, and I mean this lady I was friends with she's an older lady she's a kind of handicap she's very bad arthritis, but we are good friends, I mean I did some work for before we became friends and. She had asked me if I wanted to bring her a crutch and I eventually agreed, and it was a good situation, and it was good for like a year and a half. And everything was great I really everything was really great I mean I loved her like she was like a second grandma and she. felt the same way, and she said, I was like the grandson there and things are good, I mean I helped to do everything over to doctors appointments things were not bad, but I mean. I would say we're really good and then she went, but she did going to first serious procedures, you got like open heart surgery, and she was like gone for like a month. And the House films like just taking care of the House and tinker cat then she came back, I mean. She was happy to be back out, I was happy, she was back, but there was like some kind of like a she was kind of upset because, when she was gone. There was a friend, that I had, and I mean she was also prejudice intuition you very well and when she was at the hospital she told him he could stay, you can sleep on a couch because he was sleeping. In my in like the garage in the backseat just broken up with this girlfriend whatever and she had offered for him to stay in the House on like sleep on the couch and then she came back like. i'm he was still there, I guess you just want it like like more piece then like not anything going on at home because she just got a surgery, which is understandable, but he had he was there and. Like the person she got back like a couple of his friends showed up a couple of our friends mean his friends, and it was just it was just overwhelming. And I mean I didn't know that they were there, but this is, I kind of kicked him out but I guess it just kind of like. freaked her out and she got really upset about that and we tried to play at that time kicked me out told me to leave to me I leave. But the next day she apologized for IANA me and said that he had to leave and she didn't mean that but she was a subset, which is understandable. So everything was fine between us, but then like two days later, she just like started, she was telling. This girl stephanie from staying with and I introduced her to her, she was like telling her like a bunch of. Nonsense lives and so i'm confronted her about that and it's just why are you telling stephanie that i'm a liar and. I mean i've never lied to you, and she as she went to clarify with stephanie said no i'm not a liar whatever, but then she was just being nasty towards me ever since then, and it just took a turn for the worst and she's. Like a week, less than a week later, she got their car towed it was like laughing and I just don't know that's kind of it's really hurtful that that happened because. I didn't care about her and she was kind of I mean she was older and she was she's older lady, but she was kind of like my only friend during those times that I was going through all this other stuff."
760.0,Provider,talk to me about your your gambling problem. I can't believe how often.
16580.0,Patient,"All the time like. They don't have the money for that when you're not working, and you don't have an income. source well it's not it's not always like a huge amount, but I mean on some of the sites, you get like like reports are like money back like like. Like slowly like throughout like every couple hours or something like $1 or two or something, and I mean there's different games. I mean, sometimes you could take like 20 cents and turn into like $150, and I mean it's just it's time consuming but I mean it's like. I don't know it's just like that's just an addiction, because you never I feel like you never know you take that 20 cents or 50 cents, or whatever you got left. And you could turn it into a couple hundred dollars and it's having multiple times and it's very appealing it's very enticing but I mean realistically you just said that wasting time."
760.0,Provider,"And so, do you is that something you're doing every day. Do you think you. gamble in place of other things that maybe you shouldn't be doing. Other activities that would be more productive for you and your financial situation and resolving your other problems as well."
16580.0,Patient,i'm sure I could be doing something better or not it's not good.
760.0,Provider,Okay.
16580.0,Patient,"I just I don't know exactly what to be their own but it's been it's been difficult cuz I mean I thought, everything was good, I was I got that I. helped my buddy and gave them some money and he was he he gave me the Korean return and. I was planning to get right back to where I mean now that I had a car that was the main obstacle and i'm just trying to overcome that. I finally worked out a deal my friend and and did my part and then i've got in the car and then total almost right away, and then since then it's just been like it's really difficult to like move forward and know how to proceed when you don't have like a secure living scenario. So let's."
760.0,Provider,"say you have you have these worries and like kind of rattling around that you wake up with maybe these things that bother you about. transportation, employment, housing. And so. So you think you go to the gambling, just as like maybe to turn off the worry, or do you think it's it's it's affecting your depression."
16580.0,Patient,"I mean, I think I think it started, mainly as a way to like not constantly think about like my dad passing and constantly obsessing with. turn this and my ex and message and make her like stop ignoring me, and I think that's what it was because I knew I needed to start messaging her, and I just couldn't I didn't mean I couldn't like stop thinking about it, so I was just."
760.0,Provider,"It was all of this is through your. through the Internet, your your your messaging her through the Internet."
16580.0,Patient,Will you.
760.0,Provider,Take your exam link to the Internet. yeah so you're kind of replacing that.
16580.0,Patient,there's. A.
760.0,Provider,there's something trying to return yeah. Something yeah.
16580.0,Patient,keeps all your attention so it's not really to leave much room to be thinking about other things and show anything that really helped me stop thinking about everything. So.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so you have not grieve the loss of your father grandfather. You know. Okay, so is that something that maybe you would want to work towards like. At least working through the grieving the loss of your grandma your grandpa your father."
16580.0,Patient,"I mean I don't know exactly what you mean by that I mean I don't i'm not in denial about it, I mean i'm happy i'm not. Like i'm not upset or I was happy with the relationship we had is it wasn't like a huge surprise, I mean it was for a while, but I mean it did take a turn rather quickly towards the end but I mean. I think the main problem with that it's kinda I mean more feeling guilty that my mom's been had to deal with a lot on our own and. I mean she's not really healthy right now so that's also problem and I don't know how long she's gonna be around so that's kind of like something else it's just there waiting to. Be horrible it's kind of just like kind of feel like i've been in a period of limbo, and just waiting for all the. negative things to go wrong, and I feel like, even if I started getting back to work and know and monitored to or who knows she's gonna. Get sicker and not be healthy, and even if I started business up again I prior to leave California go back home take care, and all that so it's like it's like kinda like hard to be motivated to start something where I know it's i'm just gonna have to end it soon anyway."
760.0,Provider,Okay well and how often do you try to speak with your mother or interaction with her on the phone or Internet I will we do it.
16580.0,Patient,Right once a week or a couple times a week.
760.0,Provider,"Okay Is there something you wish, you had done different with your with your father or something you wish you're doing different with your mother now let's wish you could do more if there any thoughts like that."
16580.0,Patient,"I mean. I mean I don't think there's anything that I could have done more with mine. I don't think. I don't think I don't feel guilty about that I don't think I did anything wrong, so I mean when he was sick up in Christian went to go see them. spend some time with them. A couple months before he passed it couldn't be there all the time, but I mean I mean I know they weren't didn't feel they come to bend them or anything."
760.0,Provider,"Unless i'm just saying, sometimes. We have these kinds of thoughts, when you lose somebody and you said they're living in Pennsylvania right. that's what you said so, yes it's. quite some distance away."
16580.0,Patient,Be walking around I.
760.0,Provider,You don't want I don't want you to lose charge and then. lose the screen okay alright so.
16580.0,Patient,let's just.
760.0,Provider,Say you're feeling stressed out about. All these.
16580.0,Patient,"On housing. yeah yeah mainly the main problem has been the whole living scenario as of recently okay so. I mean it's been it's just I just feel like. I feel, like every time. someone says. I don't want to say it's really I don't want to blame stephanie but I mean there was something she said to my. upset I don't know if that's the main cause of the landlord opinion changing or getting upset and her sisters to something that editor her like stress level and but I mean. i'm pretty I can say with certainty that if I never messed up yeah I still have that place but I don't really blame her because I don't think she did it wrong, I think my landlord just handled things were only was just. Okay we're stressed out and just didn't know how things so just. So coming back to my point is that that so because of all that she kind of had said what she wanted me to stay with her and. I had to worry about it, and then, just like every time someone like says they want to help you out or you get close to someone. They always the person that just they just don't follow through they just don't keep their word and then they end up screwed because it was left to trust in someone and I don't know I don't know I just feel like. i've held up my end of the bargain with all these with these women really with my my ex my landlord and stephanie, and I mean I don't think i've done any of the many wrong, I mean, I know I really haven't done anything wrong and I just feel like it's just. it's kind of just like I don't know if that obviously trail, but I don't know if that's the right word I think it might be a little too much, but it's just like I guess a let down just not really being able to count on people. To do what they say. So I mean maybe I mean I get that I shouldn't have to depend on other people, and I should be able to depend on myself. But in in the depression, I mean yeah as been difficult, and I mean typically they can i've never dealt with depression before i've always been. very happy and optimistic, I never had any kind of depression problems or anything like that, I mean I was, I was happy, I mean those things are great, but then things got really difficult and coronavirus that was."
760.0,Provider,I guess yeah.
16580.0,Patient,"I mean started that just made everything worse and then it's just left me in a position, with a couple obstacles that are really hard to overcome. meaning the car, so I can't it's really hard to get back to what I was doing. I mean. I could find something else to do, but what I was doing and the business, I was building is this gone nails next door that but I mean."
760.0,Provider,felt it back if you if you somehow were able to get a vehicle for that.
16580.0,Patient,"I think, was the vehicle I could, yes, so I mean it's just been the obstacle. is going to come, and now it was on top of the whole living scenario being up in the air is kind of another thing this is adding to the stress this is it's a seems overwhelming and it's just I don't really know which way to go with it, or how to start and. On top of that gambling is a problem, so."
760.0,Provider,"yeah So if you start falling into habits of deleting compulsive behaviors like like gambling, or like like substance use. Are you there Steve."
16580.0,Patient,yeah i'm here I just accidentally clicked off of it.
760.0,Provider,"As I saying so, if you if we fall into those kinds of behaviors that kind of becomes a replacement, and then we start to spiral. down more because we have less time we have less energy to work on the things that that we need to do, can you talk to me a little bit about your substance use. Issues that you're raping is that nicotine you're baiting."
16580.0,Patient,Yes.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so so you is that something you do daily with nicotine."
16580.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, any other substances that you use."
16580.0,Patient,methamphetamine occasionally and alcohol occasionally and.
760.0,Provider,Define occasionally.
16580.0,Patient,"Maybe I guess last month, maybe like. 10 times, or something 10 or less, I think."
760.0,Provider,Maybe 10 times so maybe twice. Three times weekly.
16580.0,Patient,"yeah yeah it's accurate. More places now i'm we're like every day like pre like I guess maybe like slow down, maybe like six months ago. Like I need to make some changes and I stopped for a little while but I mean I don't really. I know I don't need it, but i'm sometimes it helps give me like motivator give me like a little bit of a there's to get things done when I feel a little bit too depressing just weren't sitting around okay."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, would you do you think that you would want to talk to somebody about maybe getting on some medication to get you over this hump of depression, to get going to start working on. You know, working on the problems resolving your housing your transportation your employment all that do you think that that might be something you might want to do."
16580.0,Patient,they'll be open to it okay.
760.0,Provider,"So, have you met with. A nurse practitioner or a doctor yet with us."
16580.0,Patient,"yeah did I remember the nurse practitioner list for or lists, I think, Friday okay."
760.0,Provider,You told her you were feeling depressed I suppose.
16580.0,Patient,yeah totally everything I told her. I thought I thought she was counseling.
760.0,Provider,Okay yeah.
16580.0,Patient,"knows different person, so I just treated it like it was it like it. I just order everything."
760.0,Provider,"No that's fine, I think that that's good because they kind of need to know what's going on, because you know it's not so easy to diagnose things like depression, because it's not like you can run a blood pressure. But a blood test, and you know check your levels of depression kind of have to talk about it so that's part of the process with that did she suggest anything or asked you about. medications or how did that go."
16580.0,Patient,"She asked me if I was like wanting to get some type of medication and I said, like, I was open to it and. We didn't really."
760.0,Provider,Really hate didn't go any further. Okay.
16580.0,Patient,So I guess I figured try a counseling or therapy here a couple of sentences.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, you want to try that first okay."
16580.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I would consider taking adderall again, I think, maybe that would help to eliminate. The substance abuse and if that's something that helps me keep focused and stay focused on the right things that would be definitely helpful badge I don't know I haven't taken it in a while, so I don't know how. Exactly It makes me feel now. But I know. I guess I used to get great grades in school, so I guess it worked."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so you've kind of struggled with focus in school back then. And, and how about how was it when you were working as a handyman were you able to focus at that time, or was it still kind of a struggle."
16580.0,Patient,"I mean I. wasn't I wasn't I mean I wasn't that organized, I guess, I mean I got my stuff done mostly I mean yeah I got my work done, but I mean I can definitely be more organized more. Like I guess focused I guess you'd say but yeah I guess I don't know I guess i'm not that organized It focused, but I can usually keep things. In my check or something I usually I don't I don't know, sometimes I don't know what you mean but focused I guess i'm the work like when you're working the after you're just working so it's not like. You get distracted go. chase the cat down the street when."
760.0,Provider,"People do some people do that's what that's. part of what i'm asking, but sometimes it's also a matter of getting focus from the time you get up in the morning, can I get up and get ready in the right amount of time big time to my appointment."
16580.0,Patient,Oh definitely i'm not good at though definitely not good definitely there's always a million things to do before the House and end up getting their leaders.
760.0,Provider,and find yourself procrastinating.
16580.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, definitely yes Okay, with everything ever since I can remember i'm saying that's definitely not something i'm a fan of but. I don't know how to avoid it, I always think I have more time to do something that I do."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and so, how do you usually get up during the day now to get up and get right to focusing on something or what do you what's your routine when you wake up in the morning."
16580.0,Patient,"um well. I mean, as of recently it's just been wake up i'm sleeping next to someone so it's kind of like. Wake up and it's usually getting woken up by one of her kids or something or having to wake up her kids from school or something just and it's not really there's no routine if that's what you're asking. So is. There always a different time and going to sleep later than it should and."
760.0,Provider,So you're not sleeping enough maybe.
16580.0,Patient,"Not i'm don't say I want to say I don't sleep enough, but I see play and probably wake up later than it should, I think we're good to go to sleep wake up and then go back to sleep and wake up later."
760.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, have you ever had thoughts of wanting to hurt yourself or others."
16580.0,Patient,Oh no.

760.0,Provider,Okay.
16580.0,Patient,"I mean, I used to I used to like of wood shop and make like like different furniture and stuff like that, like wouldn't crafts and stuff like that, but. it's not really something that I have the ability to do anymore, they have the wood shop and I had a good setup but my last place but I mean i've also. had lost a lot of my tools and almost all my stuff because of that eviction didn't have a car, and I did have a friend that was supposed to. get a trucking expires every move all my stuff but then it got hit by a car and hit and run on it like a motorized skateboard like. That week you're supposed to help me like couple days Bruce was how many got him killed us as much as motors skateboard, and so I kind of was like. stuck not having a way to move on my stuff in Atlanta has been a real problem, and she wasn't really allow me to get it when I wanted to. Then I went got some bit and she was a guy you gotta leave you been here too long it's like two hours and shadow people they're saying we're calling the COPs on me like i'm just trying to get my stuff, and so I I left me most of my stuff there."
760.0,Provider,If you had if you had your tools and a. place would would work woodworking be a hobby for you still.
16580.0,Patient,um I think it could be. Something I didn't enjoy. And something that also makes money.
760.0,Provider,Okay. make things and then you would sell it online or something. yeah okay.
16580.0,Patient,A lot of like wouldn't dog beds and stuff just different things it's random stuff whatever people really asked her.
760.0,Provider,Okay okay all right um and how do you think your self esteem miss.
16580.0,Patient,"um I think it varies depends on what that was, for I think it's definitely at an all time low. But I think it typically is going to think i'm typically confident myself, maybe a little bit believe I can do some things and maybe I shouldn't try and do, but I mean. I don't know like I think recently this has been really hard to believe anything because i'm going to all these things i've tried to make work and they just totally fell apart like Melissa relationship."
760.0,Provider,And yeah seems like there's been a lot of things that have gone really run for you like kind of consecutive things. From the housing to the cars to the.
16580.0,Patient,"surprising bones women in us and it's definitely them but I mean all my publishing to come from women, I mean other relationship other problems with like. interpersonal relationships with just some women also had some crazy woman that i've seen like after my accident had stolen my cat, which is an evil thing to do and. That was pretty. I was pretty hard to get over cuz I love that cat and that was like there's for a while, was just me and that cat you know. And after my ex Left and I really didn't have anyone else does that mean the cat and the cat is really cool and some crazy chicks still the cat says. Some chick that we're seeing I known him for a while till we were friends and then after my I had broken up with my ex we started. Seeing each other briefly for a little while and she was mad, I guess, and still the cat she's mad because the one time after. I forgot my accident first time we slept together, I felt weird and didn't sleep in the bed after we had sex and i'd gotten up was on the computer and I guess she was mad about that she had left at like six in the morning, the next time young absolutely still my cat. it's freaking crazy. Okay."
760.0,Provider,"All right, well."
16580.0,Patient,"This is. Just one thing after another, but yeah."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, have you have you taken any time to perhaps like write out a resume and start looking for work around where you're living now so that maybe you could find another place to live, if you could get a job is have you started that process is that something you want to work towards."
16580.0,Patient,"I mean, I have a resume I mean I."
760.0,Provider,did have.
16580.0,Patient,"Some really up to date, but I mean they weren't really take much that updated I mean i've never really been doing that much but. it's hard to know where."
760.0,Provider,"Your. audio is is you sound like you're talking in a tin can Steve. If you can fix fix the audio a little bit maybe mute yourself and then come back and see if you. see if that works try again no I don't know, did you put me on speaker. Oh that's weird Okay, we can try to talk a little bit louder because it's hard to hear you. Or maybe talk directly into the microphone. I can't hear you. I can hear you but it's it's it's thanks just let's."
16580.0,Patient,um.
760.0,Provider,"Yes, just try to keep talking loud, so that I can hear you I might I might have to ask you to repeat."
16580.0,Patient,"know what I mean sure I could get a job doing, on average, I mean, I would like to. make the right choice not down the path right stuck in a job that next 1020 years. it's kind of."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay, well, I do you mind if I make a suggestion, and I hope you can hear me better."
16580.0,Patient,If you.
760.0,Provider,"Can I make a suggestion. Sometimes in life, we have to when we have a lot of challenges going on in our life, we have to. Make like. Simple choices and make those like stepping stones like to go from unemployed to a job that maybe is not your dream job but it's something that i'm going to do for maybe six months, maybe nine months so that I can get on my feet, all the while then continue looking. Maybe so maybe the goal would be to move out maybe the goal would be to move out and save money for another vehicle so that you can restart your business. You know just because you take a job doesn't mean you have to stay there for long term. But the more you're going to stay in this kind of disciple Steve you know the depression is going to continue to build and the habit of. You know the longer you're going to continue with the habits of gambling or or relying on substances that that's can be like a downward spiral, as far as your mental health and making your life better the way you want. I like to think in terms of like stepping stones from here to there okay this i'm going to take this job it's not the job I want, but. At least it's going to get me some money in my pocket and i'm going to be able to save that money i'm going to save i'm going to get myself a car i'm going to. move in rent a different room or resolve your housing, so that you're away from the situation where you are now and then you keep going, you can keep looking for a different solution you don't have to stay there for like I don't know 10 years or whatever that makes sense. yeah okay would that be something they would want to work towards."
16580.0,Patient,"yeah I mean it's definitely something that i've been I mean i'm considering I mean i'm open i'm always open to any jobs here. Something that would fit me, and I mean I could definitely look a little bit harder."
760.0,Provider,"yeah I just would suggest that and and you know don't don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. You know, get that money I you know earn the money that you need and, hopefully, then it then you'll be able to resolve some of these things, and you start to feel better again. And maybe repurchase the tools that that that you've lost and we sum up them and start start that process again that make sense."
16580.0,Patient,yeah it doesn't excite me and I don't really.
760.0,Provider,"resistant okay. No, I."
16580.0,Patient,"Just think, maybe i'm ready to just not go that same direction that I was doing some business. Starting that whole thing it's just I mean yeah that would have been the easy route, I had a car to make money right now."
760.0,Provider,"But. that's not what you want, oh."
16580.0,Patient,yeah. I think I could just leave it all behind me better off.
760.0,Provider,"Okay well that's fine too i'm just i'm just saying to take to take a job that is done a favor something consistent. So that you have regular income and we can resolve these things you know you don't have to go back into the handyman field, I was just I thought you wanted to so okay all right Steve have you started broke yet. Tomorrow tomorrow okay all right, do you have our next appointment scheduled."
16580.0,Patient,"No, I don't I don't believe so."
760.0,Provider,Do you know how to schedule an appointment. So do you want me to have your care navigator reach out to you so that you to kind of teach you that process and to get the next appointment scheduled.
16580.0,Patient,i'm sure.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right Steve. You haven't."
16580.0,Patient,"I mean, is it on the website is it like."
760.0,Provider,"This virtual clinic yeah probably could figure it out, sometimes people struggle with it and that's why i'm asking if it's easier for you i'll just have your care navigator reach out to you. Yes, okay all right, well, it was nice meeting you. As far as working on things that we can work on next time. Work on do you want to work on learning to process emotions, do you want to work on, maybe some traumatic things that have happened in your life or maybe some mindfulness where's your head at."
16580.0,Patient,"um. I think. I don't i'm not sure honestly that's what I mean I think that's i'm not really sure that i'm the. right person to make that call or else I probably wouldn't be here, but."
760.0,Provider,well.
16580.0,Patient,I mean i'm.
760.0,Provider,"Important for you, I don't want to give you something that doesn't motivate you just like I suggested for you to go back and be a handicap a handyman you that doesn't motivate you so you know it's it's kind of like a collaborative process that i'm going to suggest things. But I kind of need you to say you know that's not really for me. Or, I feel this is, you know, whatever you whatever it is you feel and so maybe we could do some meditation mindfulness. To help you overcome some of these feelings of depression, a little bit maybe we can work on your scheduling and you're you know you know you're the negative patterns of gambling and substance abuse. Does that sound. that's that's where my head goes, but I want to hear from you that that's what you want to work on, because I can't be the one."
16580.0,Patient,"Now I understand I understand appreciate you asking for my input, but my whole thing is I just need, I think my biggest problem is finding a way to be motivated to even want to. Try to do what I need to do, science, I didn't know what I should do I knew what I need to do, I just don't have the motivation I don't really. Okay, just been i'm in a place where I just don't care because i've tried and i've tried and nothing seems to really go the right way."
760.0,Provider,"So, as far as your housing and all these problems with your cars."
16580.0,Patient,"yeah and just to say. Everything really does everything I mean So this has been a cycle of nothing going on right sources hard to see the value in putting the effort in when you put the effort in and everything goes to shit anyway. it's very cynical I don't like things thinking like that, but that's kind of where i'm at."
760.0,Provider,"Well let's we will talk about that let's well then maybe i'll just make a note and we'll talk about motivation next time. What that is and let's let's like kind of process through that a little bit next time okay. Okay, all right, well, it was nice meeting you Steve. So all right i'll see you next time and i'll have your care navigator reach out to you. Okay, you too bye."
