11657.0,Patient,"Hello. Not not much not much just got my son's like really sick right now, so he just. kind of kind of being a handful. I think you got like an ear infection like I guess the babies can't really like trading their their fluids like that, like us, so he's here, he got infected you guys like running a fever is that. Okay yeah."
724.0,Provider,"let's talk, because I can't really communicate what's wrong it's."
11657.0,Patient,"Like every little thing is wrong, like he can't seem to get sick can't seem to get comfortable."
724.0,Provider,Right yeah it's tough. giving them any like tylenol or anything for this.
11657.0,Patient,given him ibuprofen and then we did think I took him to the doctor yesterday and they prescribe some antibiotics. Okay yeah.
724.0,Provider,"All right, oh good yeah and by actual. You know, probably jack up his stomach a little bit so be prepared for lots of diarrhea."
11657.0,Patient,yeah good.
724.0,Provider,"stuff Okay, how long has this been going on for."
11657.0,Patient,"Like the shoes it's actually been a while he's usually pretty quick to kick like a bug or something, but this one's been like since last Friday, he started getting a fever. Okay yeah. it's been a little while."
724.0,Provider,So what's going on.
11657.0,Patient,"A not not a whole lot. shoe just trying to show just been following the protocol doing what I had to do for the doctors to get back to work. So I took like a ekg they said everything on there looks fine I mean there's some minor like they see like some heart palpitation and some like. Like a low, I think I was telling you like, I said, my heartbeat was low. So they said they do see that on here, but they don't see any really concern anything that concerns them that much but they're still going to send me to like a to get some further tests on my cardiologist just to kind of like totally rule out those two things that they did see. But they said, it should be nothing related to the coven, and I mean, in that, in that sense i've been feeling a lot better. Now i'm getting up and around i'm getting a lot of stuff done around the House like so that's a good sign, I mean i'm. i'm not really i'm not taking a nap throughout the day or not i'm not having to lay down at all so so that's good i've been putting on a lot of weight to since i've been off of work. really working I. i'm literally walking all I think I told you like i'm i'm walking through the warehouse like all day building pallets like so it's it's really hard to keep weight on. Right, but like since the cold yeah but I dropped some pounds like when with with that whole with the virus and everything but uh. yeah I and but I ended up when I saw the doctor they got me to start drinking those ensures. And then uh you know I started drinking no and that got my appetite back and then so i've been a just a focus on now we are again like probably like. 20 pounds since since it since the thing started so that's good I mean probably i'll probably be a you know, probably go right back go go away right when I get back to work, but it's nice nice for the meantime have a little extra. You know I mean."
724.0,Provider,"It depends um as long as you're so I. I can only imagine you know, while you're at work that you probably don't spend too much time eating or anything like that, and again, you know the postcode world we're kind of relaxed would sit down and we eat a little bit more. weight gain somewhat normal, but if you want to try to keep the weight on you just have to make sure that you're. That you're still getting calories in versus what you're putting out so if you burn a lot of calories at work, would you probably do just going to make sure that you're. you're you're you're burning to keep the weight off you're burning less calories and you're taking in does that make sense."
11657.0,Patient,"yeah and that's the hard part, though, because literally like with with the job you get so tired so literally every break i'm just eating as much as I can, like luckily, they have like a food truck that comes. yeah so I mean he brings like a like shit like though they'll have like a like he pretty much makes it all get like a big plate of this. chicken chicken teriyaki with just chicken and rice and a little bit to your House but it's feeling man it's really feeling, so I mean i'll take one of those down. break and then at lunch i'll get like a burrito or something but yeah and obviously eating I spent. quite a bit on food too that's that's the that's the hard part is it's too hard to make anything because my grown works too so it's like one of us up in the morning, I used to make stuff but now it's just like not just buying everything there but it gets expensive to."
724.0,Provider,"For sure, and like a lot of time for, for you know chicken and rice, you know, like that's really inexpensive to make like the meal prep yourself."
11657.0,Patient,"yeah for real. Time like. Time like having time off of work it's it's nice like I feel like I could have used this. Regardless but it's nice to associate with me and my mentors like just to get kind of a you know i'm seeing situated get get comfortable with what everything kind of a grip on everything it's been Nice. yeah maybe this last week I like feeling better it's been nice to like you know get like little things that i've put on the backburner taking care of. Just a lot of little little things around the House and stuff but i'm not excited and then we have some good news to hopefully uh where i'm staying so I. hear her my girls mom has a property they live in she has a house and then like we stay on like a little. Like it's actually a tiny house on the property but being with my girlfriend my kid it's like it's been a lot so we're actually going to. move into the House part of the property here pretty soon so that's exciting. get out of this little I mean it's been it's been crazy we've been at it for three years now First it was just us to and then, and then the baby came along i'm like oh man, but yeah so that's exciting to get out of that little little thing and into an actual house."
724.0,Provider,what's the timeline for that.
11657.0,Patient,"So the timeline and I was like two months, like they just put in a because the sheer to put in the papers to get rid of the tenants that are already in there. But so that's going on for like two months, given the proper notice so i'm thinking by like February, but here's the The good thing is to that, I do have like a little bit of. A little bit of money, like it's like a cool 60,000 for like a downpayment whatever that time comes, but i'm just kind of building my credit right now. But i'm I might even I might turn around it, I don't know what's gonna rent to to To begin with, but uh you know if I get the. If if if everything goes good with my credit all that gets gets taken care of I mean shoot i'm going to start, I want to start looking into like buying a place, maybe, maybe i'll just you know put put an offer, with her bomb, you know, hopefully it'll go a little better than. Then, with anybody else because I heard I keep hearing that's what's happening right now it's like people. Know you'll be putting your think you got a spot and then all of a sudden, you get outbid by somebody with a cash offer every time."
724.0,Provider,They call it like bidding wars.
11657.0,Patient,"yeah so i'm hoping, you know that we'll see we'll see what happens with that whole thing, but I mean small steps, first, I mean just getting out of the spot into a bigger place should should be really, really good."
724.0,Provider,Good.
11657.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,it's exciting for sure. yeah yeah it's stressful living in confined areas like and when you when you have extra bodies and like that occupy that space.
11657.0,Patient,As we were talking about yesterday it's like it's like we're all constantly in everybody each other's boundaries.
724.0,Provider,"yeah it's hard to have any like any real privacy, you know what I mean it's. Yes, you know. But having a kid like if you're trying to be like super quiet like that the kids sleep and, like every little thing."
11657.0,Patient,You know yeah.
724.0,Provider,yeah that'll be nice man for sure.
11657.0,Patient,"yeah no, it was."
724.0,Provider,i'm looking at your. Your surveys that you did during the week of the 23rd and you maximum out dude. Like.
11657.0,Patient,Which which ones that.
724.0,Provider,"The gad seven your anxiety wanted to your pH Q and I there's the. At Max about like score of 37 on your dad seven which is like severe rating and then you're. You know 36 on the pH tonight, what was going on during that week."
11657.0,Patient,"um which who knows Okay, so that was like two weeks ago."
724.0,Provider,yeah the 23rd.
11657.0,Patient,"yeah I can think of is. I remember yeah a couple weeks ago around thanksgiving I think it's just like for real I think it's just the holidays, the holidays like that, because I didn't notice like around thanksgiving I was feeling a little off. You know, because of like the holidays and the whole holidays meeting with your family and that kind of thing, I think that kind of like sent me into a. weird spot it's always been weird because my it's when my brother had passed away, it was literally right before thanksgiving so I noticed, like the year afterwards it was weird because it was right around thanksgiving. I just got like a like a panic attack I don't know when I was like I was thinking about i'm like maybe it's because this is around the time it takes away but it's always. Like right when the holiday start and pretty much through the holidays it's pretty it's pretty rough I mean that that that's. that's the hardest thing, probably with the with the last is dealing with the holidays. Especially like We grew up with that kind of thing like you know the all the traditions are like. You know, know it's hard to do so, I do have something planned for that i'm going to go like they have this thing i'm. At the church I go to for like surviving the holidays it's a little thing that they have for like people it's coming up this Saturday. So i'm actually going to look into that just to get some because they're talking about like maybe changing traditions and just little things like that, but. I figure I figure, you know it's worth it it's worth a shot. But I mean that's all I could think of because I was having around that time to a lot of cravings a lot of urges a lot of like but that's what i'm saying like, and I think it was also getting to. I was just sick for so long, and that in itself, I remember that, having an effect on me to like being just having no energy like that feeling of sick is a big trigger for me. Like I don't know I don't know if it's from like i've used to feel sick all the time and, like you know, I just want to. You know I just don't like that feeling or just bring it back I don't know what it is, but it, for whatever reason. Like because I remember dragging on and on it's like one or two months i've been you know but it's gotten a little bit better like I said, the last week, so I mean that that's that's pretty I think that's. You know a lot to do with it with the results of the survey to is yeah I was, I was struggling couple weeks ago."
724.0,Provider,"Right so actually when you took it and i'm not sure how to be honest with you how the score came up on here, where it says 37 when I think the Max for the get seven is 21. You know if you. If you hit threes on all seven questions like that Moses 21. So I think that's what it is."
11657.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"But still, you know you still you know what I mean essentially it's maxed out Do you remember doing threes for all of them, because i'm wondering if maybe there was an error here."
11657.0,Patient,"know as i'm saying what is it. threes the ones I remember is like. Now it's easy not three for all of them, because usually like one or two that aren't the Max or the you will by three you're saying isn't to say like very difficult somewhat. yeah or yeah. i'm pretty sure that they shouldn't all be like that."
724.0,Provider,"yeah cuz i'm just going off of like like the pie chart I wonder if I can, if I can click on it, it will show me the actual. The actual assessment. Because I have like like the the question here is like in a separate tab that I could look out for their questions and stuff like that."
11657.0,Patient,"And then, in two weeks I got that appointment for the the assessment. is so i'm really excited for that one So hopefully we can. We can get some somewhere with that. buddy buddy."
724.0,Provider,"And even on. Even on the pH nine like the most you could match so it's 27 so i'm not sure where they got. You know, like the the 36 and 37 from. And unless there's something else that they. All say they use a different one. yeah, I think, for some reason there's an error."
11657.0,Patient,yeah that sounds probably right.
724.0,Provider,"yeah because, looking at. This thing i'm not sure everyone was dated. It tells my mom saying. Created the 23rd so as I look at it right now. yeah you had a. A 13 which is modern so it's different than want to show me and that now the gas or be scored 18 you know you had 123456 threes one, two and one. One so I mean you scored an 18 overall so it's still severe for anxiety which makes sense of what you're saying. yeah but. Okay i'm gonna have to you know potentially have somebody look at this or explain it to me better I don't know what they're doing here and then zero for self harm okay. You don't have any history of self harm correct no thoughts behaviors intense plans. No prior tabs. No okay yeah that's what I thought I appreciate this before. I went have somebody take a look at this and just see if they can clean it up, because it like on your graph like like your graph is very consistent, you know what I mean and then it's."
11657.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,it's like maxed out that week like they're both of them are like through the roof it's like you know there's an.
11657.0,Patient,outlier there for them.
724.0,Provider,yeah huge outlier which is. You know not uncommon to see you know people peak what this thing is like. yeah and it's kind of way out there for you. yeah based on like your patterns.
11657.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah i'm still chewing the gun to slip slip a couple of times with this and I haven't bought a pack, but like. Now, like, I went bought like a like a like the black and mild cigar like so. i'm noticing, like every like. Every third like it's for me it's like the third or fourth day it's when it's when it's the hardest it's hard to. Because I noticed that I would go like three days, and then on the Third, the third day for like a couple weeks straight, I would like smoke one of those black and miles on the third day and now sudden right now i'm online now i'm on the fifth day so i'm trying to. Trying to break the cycle."
724.0,Provider,"But yeah i'll tell you what man, it is it it's so hard."
11657.0,Patient,"Right now it's gonna be some who's going to be some some stumbles along the way, but. The way I look at it is just it's very reassuring because, even before the coven I was like man I just I just want to stop, and it is. I am reassuring myself like you know oh shit I feel a lot better feel healthy I think when that once I start seeing that more and more than that starts outweighing the cravings then that's when that's when i'll be in a good spot but it's like and it's like the cravings are just. it's not and they go away, but it's just like what do I do with my time like I don't think this is what I normally would and then the stress starts mounting up and you're like this would be a good time yeah."
724.0,Provider,"And there's something to be said about like. You know, with nicotine. And the ritual of smoking, like it really does it's it's terrible that it it's like a slow lit time bomb waiting to go off in your chest, you know what I mean. yeah he's like like that five minute decompression that it does provide you it from personal experience, like it really isn't enough to just kind of de escalate you when you are stress and things do happen like whether or not you're stressed at home and you're like."
11657.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"i'm about to say some real crazy shit that i'm not gonna i'm gonna regret here in a second and like i'm just gonna go outside and then you, you really do in five minutes like whatever it is like that whole system, it really does. come down it's just it's like a it's a weird grounding effect that you can do. that's super awful for you, but it offset something awful that that's going on at the same time it's like. yeah, why is it type of thing. But. it's just really it's really bad for you, I mean it's, it is very difficult to kick because. i'm sure once you get back to work i'm sure, a lot of people probably smoking those segues like. that's where it's like a real tough real real like you could be solid for two weeks, but it's like any other drug man what it's like just dangling in front of you look at carrot, like all the time it's."
11657.0,Patient,Like that's what i'm saying yeah.
724.0,Provider,"that's all gymnastics like you're gonna have to jump through in the beginning, like. super hard, but you."
11657.0,Patient,"Know that's where all of that is knowing that it's there because I was taking. Like okay like times when i've been incarcerated and stuff it's like and you don't even think about cigarettes and you don't have. Like nothing but that's because they're not. it's not available there's no there's no option, the fact that you have you know you can go to the store anytime I get it's like hey you gotta really want to stop are also still you know, like you said that little cigarette dangling in front of you it's gonna. it's gonna win over every time you know."
724.0,Provider,"When I when I was in the process of quitting and it wasn't just like like it. Like the Epiphany for me to quit happen overnight it wasn't something like I was planning on doing. Like set a target date or was like a new year's resolution of just kind of just happen as I was smoking, I was like I don't want to do this anymore, and I, you know I flicked it. But then, after that you know, like I had some like road like stumbles big time symbols were like maybe I bought a pack, and then I was didn't get through the whole thing gave it away or smoked a handful and it was like every time I did it, I was like. I get halfway through and like oh shit get rid of it all, and I did it when I was at the service which is crazy because, like. Military was all like you're not allowed to do drugs right so most people are closet alcoholics and everybody. Does some kind of tobacco chewing tobacco smoking, whatever it is, and I would literally get to work and. A lot of us we get to work, early because we had like a smoking section where everybody would just you know gather around and you'll just talk. Talk shop smoke cigarettes and then get to work so like I had like forced myself to. Like start showing up like five minutes before my shift started, because I do there was no way, I was not going to go like walk over and hang out my friends and then be around that and just be like. yeah I quit smoking know why everybody's just gonna like look at you, the crazily, then why are you in the smoking, sex, you know so."
11657.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Like little things that I had to start doing for myself, where I was like I can't I can't do it like i'd be walking into my friends with like you know bust my chops like I see what you're doing. A good job like whatever you'd like because it was like. You know it's nerve racking and then, once you start getting over that it then you start replacing like like your ritual times. You know, you might be like yeah I don't smoke after first thing the morning I drink my coffee I smoke after I eat dinner, whatever your ritual times are once you start replacing those that's. You know that's a that's a chore but only takes a little bit to get over it, and you're like okay I don't do that anymore, when I drink my coffee learned to live without it. yeah and and the hard thing was like going out to the clubs going out to the bars and you're drinking, like, for me, I was like drinking beer, and it was always like you always needed both those things up so that was like super hard so I had like these checkpoints. That I start getting through like avoid going over the smoke pit hanging out my buddies you know that took a while it's like replace all my my standard smoking times. It had to go wow when I will go out, you know socializing like that you know that type that stuff took a while it's like I won't buy a pack. But i'll give my body like a handful of money and, like the Max he can give you out when we were out for the night, it was like five you know I started doing these things and little by little. You know I tapered off, just like people taper off medication like it wasn't like yet my cold Turkey and that's a wrap you know, like it took it took a while it probably took from start to finish, maybe three months of just hard work, you know what I mean."
11657.0,Patient,yeah I know.
724.0,Provider,I got to the point I got over it.
11657.0,Patient,"yeah that's yeah that's reassuring no it's not it's not that that's not that bad. With the other, the other problem for a lot longer than that and that's the thing I see a lot of similarities between not I don't know I see. This with the cravings. it's very, very similar very."
724.0,Provider,Similar there is a habitual habit to it.
11657.0,Patient,"it's like once you think through it and you think about it, like in within the big picture it's like okay I don't want to do it, but when it first hits you your initial when i'm sick i'm like oh. This the automatic feeling that you have an urge it's like man he's like without thinking it through that's the worst part."
724.0,Provider,Right.
11657.0,Patient,"Just the feeling of, and then I always like to run it by my mind like like and then I catch myself like considering like should I, or should I say it's just a crazy game I played my head over and over. it's there's a lot of similarities."
724.0,Provider,"yeah I mean nicotine is the most addictive substance that that we have out there, right now, you know that we have access to i'm sure there are other like pharmaceutical things that they could make up that the human body would be more adapted to or. Like. You know, easily addicted to but like it goes like nicotine caffeine opiate So those are your big three you know I mean so."
11657.0,Patient,"Like caffeine, is a big one too yeah."
724.0,Provider,"And it was first two are like like the secondary issue with those first two is like accessibility, you know what I mean like it's too easy to get that stuff so it's like that's a built in barrier where you're like yeah I could just go to the store and get Coca Cola it's not like. I have to like search it out and go through like nefarious channels to get to it like like that's that's a secondary problem you going to deal with. But what you're doing, though, is like you know they call it like playing the tape through and there's a bunch of like metaphors for but you're essentially doing like a like a cognitive behavioral therapy technique called. You know catch it and you check it and then you change the behavior so like like, as it happens you're like I really got a craving right now. I can't be doing that, so now you've caught it and now you're starting to check yourself and it's like why, why can I do right now, because I don't have the money. I don't want to smell like it, I know it's bad for me and i've been good for five days i'll do all these things it's like by the time you get to the part of changing it is just like i'm just not going to do it. But walk yourself through like all these steps. To get through initially they call it, like the three c's it's a you could use that technique for. For grounding."
11657.0,Patient,"You know, dealing with change and what."
724.0,Provider,"You catch it so it's like she don't want a cigarette right now. yeah I caught it now, you know caught myself slipping a little bit. yeah and then i'm going to check myself and it's like Why can I smoke a cigarette you know it started being like. dot dot dot dot dot."
11657.0,Patient,dot you.
724.0,Provider,"And i'll just not going to do it, so I changed the thought process because I caught it early."
11657.0,Patient,yeah I can change.
724.0,Provider,You up the three c's.
11657.0,Patient,"Like it, I think that one yeah that seems. That seems like a yeah just not all the time, do I do I do it in that order, though sometimes I don't think about like when I don't. check it that's the problem."
724.0,Provider,"Right yeah sometimes. you'll catch and you're just like Oh well. And then you just skip the last few steps if you just go to like effort you know what I mean so. yeah Those are the three c's there it's a technique that you use for grounding you know. Whether anxiety techniques are like like the 54321 you know, once you like catch your breath, you know so like it like you said that you had a panic attack right or you felt like you were. An anxiety attack once you catch your breath, you know what I mean and you're under control and you'd ever want to like huddle over you know. and trying to like take deep breaths you're never going to catch your breath so you'd like literally gonna stand up, you know pull your shoulders back and lift your arms up the laws your diaphragm expand a little bit you know. start counting back you know 10 it's like get your breathing like matic and then you do like five things I can see."
11657.0,Patient,Oh yeah yeah i've heard.
724.0,Provider,Things I can feel three things I can hear.
11657.0,Patient,"Two things like this to ground up my mind off, of whatever is that yeah."
724.0,Provider,"it's really just a way of distracting that thought process because we get stuck in these these patterns in these loops. You know what we justify why we should do so that despite knowing that we probably shouldn't we can just stay stuck in that loop, so the idea is like to distract yourself your watch like the dog whisperer like it used to be like years ago like Caesar Milan. yeah and he would go around and he would find dogs, he would like and like you know kick them like like their. End of the dogs like they're acting all crazy and he does this thing they like look up at. US it's the same thing you kind of get like snap yourself out of that that current process and you're like oh my God, not that somebody should come over like kick you in your ribs and it's like Okay, but essentially that's what it is you're kind of you know, getting out of that circle. You know you're stuck there, and you just kind of break yourself out by distracting yourself so it's a grounding technique, just like the three c's like all these things are just techniques to kind of buy you some time. So you can collect your thoughts and then you."
11657.0,Patient,"can make a rational decision, no."
724.0,Provider,You never want to make like a like a decision based on a rationality so.
11657.0,Patient,Now now.
724.0,Provider,"And that's a problem with cigarettes man is that cigarettes gave you like that five minutes and I used to keep track of it, it was like from the time it like I got some my spot. It started smoke my cigarettes, it was like literally five minutes five minutes of my time, but sometimes that's just enough to de escalate a situation. So that's that's the one pro that that that thing's got amongst many cards obviously so like it's it's still not worth it, but. Five minutes essentially is all you need to kind of like. collect yourself, so if you get a walk off, you know. countdown check your senses are your three c's Those are all very good anxiety grounding it's like techniques to use. So keep that in mind, I still journaling."
11657.0,Patient,"yeah yeah no I don't know quite a bit I noticed that I do like, especially now that I have time it's pretty much like every almost every day, not like every other day. I got that going on. See. Just a lot of just a headache with getting this disability, because I still I still haven't received my disability i've been out of work for now. So i'm barely getting to where it's like becoming a problem but luckily I had enough money saved stacked up yeah but I mean it's all going to come back page just. I mean that's, the only real stress that I have right now and it's and I just know that it's all gonna work out, you know because i've done everything I I i've done everything I can. i've done, I mean not everything I can i've done everything I had to do to ensure that you know i've done my end so I mean i'm just waiting for it to come, I know that's, all I can do and. You know, so I know that that'll work itself out it's just been kind of frustrating him and I feel like it should have been done like. over a month ago, but, for whatever reason. i'm not controlling that. it's out of my control as they would say. over it."
724.0,Provider,"Right, have you tried calling or do they have like a like a telephone number, you can call."
11657.0,Patient,"You have that. right by where I stay. Because usually the the the actual office is like you know, really, really, really busy, but they have a disability office right by my house and I know that just because I. Just don't know because I live right by it, I do, I always I don't always add or sd state disability, but anyways you go in there, and you get you get seen within like. Literally 15 minutes you can talk to somebody behind a computer that has all the information so that part hasn't been hard it's just that they don't have anything in the system like. So the doctor had me they usually do it online to where like you know get you know I mean, from what I gather that's like the more efficient way to do it is online when the doctors do it online and they. The State gets it right away. And if they need to make any changes, then they can just do it on there, but my doctor, for whatever reason, want to do it. Like the old school way with a with a form and a pen and paper, so I sent it in, and I still haven't gotten you I send it in right before thanksgiving and I still haven't got any words stating that they received it, or anything. And this was you know before thanksgiving and so these people that I see in the office they. Think it's all they know is that they haven't received that paper yet so it just somewhere in the mail, obviously, but I mean they say it could take a couple weeks to process it to or to scan it into the system or whatever, but it's just been kind of a just a. Just a series of unfortunate events with this with this whole deal, but I mean it's like I said it's gonna work itself out, I mean like I said i've done everything I can I feel like. i'm. yeah I mean it's all I could do is just wait till I get a message from the. Online they have a where you can check the status of it but it's just a matter of checking out every day, I mean I can't really do much else."
724.0,Provider,"Okay um yeah I mean I wish I could tell you that there's a better system in place, but you know I both know that's a that's not accurate. um yeah I mean I would use probably give it like a few more days like like check on like Thursdays, because. Like a lot of stuff doesn't update, especially with the holiday, so if the holiday was on you know, there is a you can assume that if it's like a state, since it is a state run operation that they probably had like the entire week off so they're already a week behind when they say."
11657.0,Patient,yeah that's. that's what i'm gathering to they didn't have the whole week. So they giving.
724.0,Provider,"yeah, so I would probably anticipate you know I would start checking things like that, and what I would do is follow up on Thursdays. You know if if it has the option that'd be like check your status, I would check it Thursday by like close of business and if I didn't see any movement or traction that I would use the following day Friday the start calling early to talk to somebody would like a soul, you know. Well yeah because at least. You can kind of. Give yourself almost like a whole day to check things but following the holiday, you probably a week beyond so I probably really want it start checking until next week. This. yeah so you know and i'm sure their backlog, you know California, is a ginormous state so i'm sure."
11657.0,Patient,down.
724.0,Provider,The systems are inundated.
11657.0,Patient,um.
724.0,Provider,So yeah that's what I would do.
11657.0,Patient,"yeah I mean that's the AK with that said that's that's the really the only only thing I can complain about and other than that everything's everything's pretty good. Okay, my son being sick. But I mean other than that yeah I spirits. Just know like I said, I think this time just just not knowing myself into the work and just having time to think At first it was kind of awkward. And I am still having like a lot of lot of like really vivid dreams with like my my my mother and my brother and all that kind of stuff. So I mean it just kind of weird at first like dealing with that, but oh it's kind of a it's kind of a good feeling, at the same time i'm just walking through and and like. You know, looking back and seeing a lot of man, I used to be really, really overwhelmed with these kind of feelings I don't know and now i'm kind of having a little better so maybe i'm you know, maybe i'm walking through it a little a little better than that I was."
724.0,Provider,"Did you did you start having these dreams, when you started the the tobacco cessation."
11657.0,Patient,pretty much yeah. Okay yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Do you take, do you have the passion you just chewing gum."
11657.0,Patient,"No it's just a just a gun. Oh good yeah I didn't notice the gym I haven't really vividly I think I told you when they first started like a couple months, like a month or two ago but yeah I can't quite place it. I mean, now that you mentioned that tobacco like yeah it is kind of about the same time, is that but yeah I for the longest time I was kind of equating it to like. Because I was working so much I figured I was just like maybe I was just so worn out and I just fell asleep, it was in such a deep sleep, but it can be that as well."
724.0,Provider,It could be chances are man like things are. Things are so rarely like black and white.
11657.0,Patient,"And the material and it's so complicated that I just say there's probably like it's always like a combination of things you know, in certain circumstances it's clearly not when you get stung by a bee you have an allergic reaction like it's pretty."
724.0,Provider,"You know, cause an effect like that. yeah I think we would have like a lot of other. You know life stressors and stuff like that it builds over time and our brains do a good job. Like protecting us, for the most part and keeping sub stuff like subconsciously managed in a you know in there, like dream states it kind of comes up. But I asked about the nicotine thing because, and I don't know if it works with GM but you might want to look on the back packages and see what the side effects of the GM is because I I when I was trying to quit I got nicotine patches right."
11657.0,Patient,And uh huh.
724.0,Provider,"I was deployed overseas and my first deployment and. Our flight flight medic was like hey guys he saw the smoking is like you guys should quit smoking and we're like whatever guy. So then, he was like I have a whole bunch of like nicotine patches in my 10 if you guys want him he's like he's like just come over i'll give you a bunch. And we're like yeah not going to happen and then he was like but don't wear him at night, because you have crazy vivid dreams are like ah you piqued our interest. yeah. What are you talking about he's like yeah gives you crazy dreams, it says, out of the box, not to wear like to bed and we're like Okay, but so like we went up to his tent we got a whole bunch of were like. And then we fell asleep, and like true to his story man like like the following morning is like after like a couple days like when you really did have like crazy vivid dreams, like the recall that that we had after that it was just like. able to talk about because, after months of like just being in the same spot with. sharing the same experiences you run out of stuff to talk about very quickly and it just turns into like talking about ball movements all day. So we were like yeah it was also so then he gave us like. It generated like like talking points for us to be like yeah my dream was like this."
11657.0,Patient,"So, like so fun actually."
724.0,Provider,"yeah so what happens is it like with a patch and I don't know if the job does, but the patch increases like cortisol and our brand and that floods, the brain and the transmitters and then you have more lucid dreaming, so it could be attached to that you know."
11657.0,Patient,Like I said a lot of yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Look at combination things just for the haha, so I would check the box and see if it says anything about dream states, because it might it might be a contributing factor."
11657.0,Patient,yeah that's interesting.
724.0,Provider,"um i'm very good, so what is the date for that appointment with a psych. You know what time."
11657.0,Patient,"I have it written down I think it's like a want to say, like 1130 so. He said a 10 o'clock. Well yeah i'm looking. Looking forward."
724.0,Provider,"To be curious, so how it plays off for. Now I talked to Dr Rudolph and I know that you and I talked before about coming to groups like. monthly. If you want to come more often like like you can like like it's totally open to you. So okay I got if you feel like like a you get a little bit more out of you know, increased frequencies and stuff like that, by all means, like show up like you don't get dig yeah for. For showing up extra you know what I mean like you're only required to do at minimum like once a month, but if you want to go more fun than that you totally should we talked about."

724.0,Provider,"Alright alright, so let me see if I can pull up my calendar schedule you for."
11657.0,Patient,"yeah cuz I was just talking to him yesterday because I had to reschedule this appointment, but they said i'm pretty sure they only had one appointment with you."
724.0,Provider,"Let me, let me double check that we make two appointments last month we did."
11657.0,Patient,What I think I thought we did.
724.0,Provider,Like a double check no worries.

11657.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
724.0,Provider,"yeah that's what i'm for. yeah I don't look too far, I actually went to school with a buddy of mine his uncle's are the guys that like direct to those movies dumb and dumber and me, myself and Irene. Oh really yeah like dumb and dumber is like shot a lot in like the big city here relative Providence and."
11657.0,Patient,me myself and Irene is.
724.0,Provider,"Like shot out the poor, which is like the hoity toity all the like old old money like vanderbilt's and get. A like turn of the century, like crazy crazy bonnie like chuck kind of bodies like the matches that they have out there, like insane."
11657.0,Patient,Oh yeah. yeah now it's a pretty well off state isn't it Rhode island.
724.0,Provider,"Ah. No, I think I think we're I think we're in the red. With that they're pretty liberal here."
11657.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"You know, to a fault or they're probably a little too liberal. It keeps a lot of people stuck you know states like that, where they. yeah I agree."
11657.0,Patient,"Exactly I used to think The other thing is obviously I think I was taking advantage of those those those things but you're right, it does it does kind of limit the growth, like you, you're not really pushing people you gotta. You know you're not going to get anything out of just handing it out."
724.0,Provider,"yeah so yeah I mean. I like the idea of taking care of people it's like socialism to certainly agree, I like the idea of keeping everybody on almost. An equal opportunity like almost guaranteed opportunity because capitalism like guarantees you the option to pursue like you know riches beyond your wildest dreams, but it doesn't guarantee you that. It just get the chance to do that we're socialism like like if there was like a certain level it's like. yeah you know, maybe, maybe everybody should have health care that you don't have to pay an obscene amount of money into if we could just figured that out to where. You know, everybody kind of benefits from that that would be cool you know we already have forms of socialism in this country where it's like. public safety that's a form of socialism, you know your task was to paying for fire departments, law enforcement paramedics that kind of stuff like all that stuff is good because it keeps society like like unified. You have to incentivize people to like you got to go to work, you know people have purpose and they feel purpose when they when they can you know cash a check and if they could perform a task you know, whatever it is, you know. Little things like that even even in college like if you can guarantee like the first two years of college would be you know is free. You know, or all college, you know theoretically should be free, if you want to pursue an education, like you, shouldn't have to be limited to you know, taking out student loans buried in that kind of stuff like you should be like yeah I want to go to school, I should have to pay. yeah further because not everybody wants to do that so like you should be able to do that and not have to worry about you know, being in debt for 20 years when you're done with it so. yeah things like that I like, but what they do poorly in most in most states is they just keep people stuck in poor. living off the state so."
11657.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"it's unfortunate I wish there was a better way to do it, but I haven't figured it out yet. yeah what else has either. yeah so 1212 eight was the only level that we have that that's today so let's make one for a couple of weeks do that and. Have you done your talk screen yet."

724.0,Provider,"For transcription That was the session with kyle hollis we have a follow up appointment on Wednesday, the 22nd at 9am Pacific standard time we discussed. Some anxiety coping skills we went over his his surveys has got seven php nine and there's some discrepancies there because, on the the care, excuse me, the can't measure page itself and so that he scored 36 of US php 937 other get seven and, I believe, like the vax is like. 21 of those surveys so as I look through the the physical survey responses that he did you actually scored a 13 on the pH cannot in at on the get seven for that reporting period of the 23rd so i'm not sure how those inflated numbers came to be. But we should probably going to contact Catherine and see if she can point in the right direction, to see how we can clean that up. As far as his goals he updated some of his goals there so just review, for the record. And then we'll continue to monitor for treatment plan, thank you."
