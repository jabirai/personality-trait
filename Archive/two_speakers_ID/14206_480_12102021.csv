14206.0,Patient,"hi Christine. i'm good I just sayin um I feel like these last few weeks i've been kind of two weeks, something like that i've been kind of like running around with my head cut off because I have finals and. Work and my brother and I are going to Arizona. This Sunday so see my aunt and uncle so i've been trying to get everything done before I go and I work until Saturday so i'm like I just. I just feel like there's a lot going on and i'm so which is not it's not and I was actually talking to I just got my toes done like a pedicure i'm just. yeah yeah and I was talking to. My friend and like we're just talking about like how I told her i'm like how busy I am and then I was like I want to preface that it's not necessarily a good thing, like, I feel like society puts a lot of. Importance importance on working working working working and. Right, like in reality they're just running away from whatever they're trying to deal with and filling it with filling an empty hole with other things you know and. It can work but not like short term right it's not going to like work out in the long run, so I did preface that I was like just because i'm busy doesn't mean it's like a good thing, like it's like."
480.0,Provider,"Right and there always has to be a balance. Right between being busy enough to stay focused and because a lot of people that struggle with mental illness, myself included, like, I have to have some level of structure to feel. yeah i'm functioning at my best."
14206.0,Patient,I was just gonna say yeah.
480.0,Provider,"yeah so there has to be like some level of structure accountability like. yeah penis, so to speak, but not to the point of like you said being pulled in every direction where you feel like you can't catch your breath."
14206.0,Patient,yeah and it's felt like that these last few weeks. Like it's I love work. I really do love work and it's just hard with school also. i'm already yawning. i'm like i'm already tired and I have to work till 830 tonight so i'm just like.
480.0,Provider,For now.
14206.0,Patient,"And maybe I think like I have an hour or hour and a half before I have to go to work. Okay yeah so I might be able to slip in something like where I can rest, but I also my um my brother got me i'm a new mattress for. For my bed, and so, which is really nice of him um. He it's also funny though he was like because we had a fight before thanksgiving he was like you're not getting your Christmas gifts and like he's kind of manipulative so like I was like I don't care like I just don't want to fight with you, you know what I mean."
480.0,Provider,The older younger.
14206.0,Patient,younger he by 22 months.
480.0,Provider,wow so you guys are close.
14206.0,Patient,"yeah yeah we we tend to we've gone through a lot with each other, you know and. familiarity breeds contempt points so um but i'm bb kind of manipulative and. It can be really hard sometimes because he has some of my dad's traits and I worry that I have some my dad's traits, of course, but like it's very prominent in some of the things that he does so."
480.0,Provider,"Anyway, talk to me about. dad because I don't know. yeah. pretty much because of obviously we don't get into that in group so. yeah family dynamics, you and your brother have. The same mom and dad."
14206.0,Patient,yeah we have the same mom and dad and my dad passed away when I was 10 I found out on father's day it was from manslaughter um but you.
480.0,Provider,know this father's day.
14206.0,Patient,"No, I found out when I was 10 on father's day that he had passed away from a car accident from a drunk driver that he was with. But it gets even deeper than that he was trying to get revenge and like wanted him to get pulled over and go to jail, but instead they got into a car accident and. yeah my dad told my mom this before he left it was like he left it like 12 midnight, something it at night, you know, and I was always happy when he left, because then I could just sleep next one, my mom and take his spot you know, like."
480.0,Provider,an alcoholic.
14206.0,Patient,"He wasn't an alcoholic and he was a narcissist i'm. Pretty I think he was in our service, I think he might have had some other things going on, he never was diagnosed with anything I should say that. But he had a lot of really abusive traits like manipulative. He was very dominant like my mom is very submissive even to this day she's very submissive like um, and so I never felt like she kind of like helped us. or took like she never protected us it always felt like but she has told me before that she'd had to this was after he passed away that I found out that she had to like hide me otherwise he was going to hurt me when I was a baby. I had to hide me. She was still with him like they're never married, but they were together. For a while, but my mom's I have a half brother and found out after my dad passed away that I have a half brother. Was that."
480.0,Provider,From dad.
14206.0,Patient,"From mom my mom was in another relationship where she was actually married had a kid and he was physically abusive to my mom. Like my dad was never physically abusive to my mom but definitely verbally but he was physically abusive to me my brother verbally abusive to us. And then we can get into the kind of the other things that he was doing but um yeah in all in all, like it was I saying I can't remember what I was saying."
480.0,Provider,You were saying that you know you had a half brother.
14206.0,Patient,"yeah I found out that I had a half brother and. The reason why my half brother has a lot of money mental issues and physical issues is because my dad had pushed him down the stairs um. And so, like my half brother my brother and I never like we never my brother and I, my full brother and I never really got along with my half brother, because my. Half brother definitely had a lot of resentment towards us that my mom chose us instead of him to be with right and and my dad would keep my mom away from my half brother. yeah, and again I forgot I don't know if I said this, but my mom's previous. relationship, he was abusive to her and verbally abusive and yeah he's an alcoholic and everything um."
480.0,Provider,And so that's a half brothers death.
14206.0,Patient,that's the half brothers dad who's passed away already but yeah.
480.0,Provider,The half brother now.
14206.0,Patient,Was that.
480.0,Provider,Do you have contact now with your half brother.
14206.0,Patient,"um I only see him, maybe like. It was for his birthday. Earlier this year I had just moved back to California, and so I went with my mom for his birthday and we went and got dinner and but um so I don't really have contact with him it's maybe like once or twice a year. The reason for that is because. Like he you know is like he's kind of. he'd always start my butt and like. weird comments and like. he's just not. Right like there's. Definitely some maybe."
480.0,Provider,there's something there.
14206.0,Patient,"Wrong yeah and that could be contributed because of my dad pushing him down the stairs and he, like he has a limp because of it i'm just really. A whole like very weird. things that have happened yeah and so i've struggled definitely with like my dad passing and not having like some sort of like full circle moment of like you, who did this to me, you know, like."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
14206.0,Patient,"And, but I think a lot of my resentment lies in my mom because I felt like she never protected us, but then I have been told before that she's done the best that she could at the time, you know. And it makes sense, like if she went from one abusive relationship to another like that she she doesn't she doesn't trust herself and relationships that's why she hasn't been in a relationship or even gone on a date, since my dad has passed away I am 25 now, and he. passed away when."
480.0,Provider,I was 15 years ago. yeah wow yeah.
14206.0,Patient,"She hasn't um or she just hasn't told me that she's gone in a day, but I doubt it she's always either working at home, like she only ever goes and hangs out with friends like sometimes not that often um so yeah she is so lot of like resentment lives within and then."
480.0,Provider,"Well, and I think it's important just to point out that you can be angry and resentful and still understand. Why she. did what she did like it doesn't have to be either or right, so you can still feel that emotion, because, yes, of course, as a child, like it, it was her job to protect you and she didn't do her job. yeah but at the same time, you can have compassion and grace, for her because you understand that she wasn't healthy enough to stand up for herself, let alone kids so. It doesn't have to be either or."
14206.0,Patient,"that's true and even to this day, though I feel like she doesn't advocate for herself. I am. I stand up for her if my brother and her having an argument which I shouldn't put myself into that situation, but I do i'm I like but she never does the same for me like she never if my brothers being manipulative or anything like that, like she doesn't. have that same like passion to stand up for me that I have for her. and"
480.0,Provider,What you can expect her to because if she can't stand. up for herself how she going to stand up for someone else.
14206.0,Patient,"yeah right exactly yeah that's true yeah so it's always felt like. We had to because it went from like this controlling nature controlling environment really. traumatic environment to then she just she didn't know what to do, she she filled our sorrows with like either. getting us things are, but you know we're not rich like I live in a mobile home like I so it wasn't a she didn't know how to Paris she didn't know how to set boundaries or create a structured environment, it was like. my brother and I just did whatever we wanted, but whatever I wanted to do it was pleasing others to in order to be like an ordered."
480.0,Provider,codependency to give you.
14206.0,Patient,"yeah so like I didn't have like a little phase until I was after after 21 That was when I like we go to bars are like have my like my teenager phase right, it was much later because I. I was always worried about pleasing others and. And like. Wanting to be like the best. I don't know like like acceptance, you know, like approval. of others, because I never got that, from my dad. So um."
480.0,Provider,"Well, and to it sounds like when your dad was around it was very rigid in the House, because he was controlling right. yeah so a rigid environment creates a lot of anxiety because you're constantly being told, no and being criticized without like. Given the opposite of like Well, this is what's expected and not what the problem is and then so going from that to an environment, with no structure, which also causes anxiety so ideally you want there to be. structure with flexibility for kids to feel safe right so consistency and structure but not overly rigid and they know what to expect, and so you went from one extreme to the other extreme. In the middle of your childhood. So of course that's going to cause a lot of anxiety and some ways to cope with anxiety are like you said, people pleasing like seeking out validation from other people will be."
14206.0,Patient,"Like well yeah and then that's what was my. Especially after my breakup. Last year, my ex broke up with me three days before Christmas, last year, and so this is a it's a difficult time because. I thought I was going to marry him like I thought I was you know it was such a we just mesh so well together, but now, after being out of that relationship, I can see that there were a lot of red flags like. He would bring up just really weird things like how he, like. This was like in the beginning of our relationship and he, like even his friends were like, why are you saying that, but he would bring up like how. He cuz he played the bass you like have girls sit on his amp or something and like he brought up that like his ego and i'm like okay like his friends were like you should probably shut up like that is like. It was just really stupid shit like that and. Really, especially when he was drunk he was just really like. Really stupid and would say the worst things and, but when there was one day, where. i'm We well that's even like another can of worms is that whole relationship and like. And then even the relationship before that I don't know where to start honestly like."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so here's. here's a good starting point. Because we can get into details, with both of them in the future, but common themes that you're working on not repeating. Between the two relationships so like you said you noticed some red flags, after so. Part of becoming healthier right in relationships is knowing what version of yourself, you don't want to show up in relationships again so like for me I struggled with codependency for a long time. That idea of like sacrificing everything to make the other person happy at all times, even if it's like to me."
14206.0,Patient,Exactly yeah yeah.
480.0,Provider,"yeah so, like the other guys like we can get into details later, but like the most useful is you, and how you showed up in the relationships and what behavior you allowed because of how you showed up."
14206.0,Patient,"yeah exactly yeah I I wanted to be the cool girl the happy always happy like always i'm like oh I don't have problems like. i'm there everything like I I fix them I make them happier I I get along with their family, I get along with their friends, I love everybody, you know, like, I can. spark a conversation with anyone, you know and that's not necessarily not true, but like it's just was like I had to be this perfect. model and he just be drunk sometimes and say stupid shit and like it was Okay, because he's the guy you know right, and so I like it's always like there's this like, especially in society like guys can be like the stupid ones, and women are the ones that are smart and know what to do."
480.0,Provider,When that's not to be responsible and we have to take care of their drunk.
14206.0,Patient,"Messages so yeah exactly yeah. And so. The worst I would say, the worst thing that happened in that relationship was he said that I gained too much weight and so yeah That was a red flag complete red flag, I had been. I we were dating and he we weren't ready I wasn't ready to move in with him, he wasn't ready to move in with me, I mean I was more willing to move in with him. Because, again, I would have sacrificed even anything to do to be with him, you know. And so um we didn't end up moving in with each other, I was having medical issues I moved in with my friends family. Of endometriosis and fibromyalgia so I I was dealing with a lot of fat and I had to stop working, and it was just a mess I moved in with my friends, family and like they wanted to move back to new Mexico, so I moved back to new Mexico for four. I moved with them for four months. To new Mexico for four months, I was still dating my ex we were long distance dating. Eventually, after the four months, he can pick me up we moved in together, it was like that night at the hotel that we stayed at while we're still traveling back to utah that. I felt like something was just off like it was just wrong like it didn't feel right I didn't feel like I made the right decision, but I reframed it in a way that. In my mind that made sense so, then I just continued on with their relationship so it's a lot of denial, a lot of reframing like my own feeling."
480.0,Provider,Of like. Talking yourself out of your intuition.
14206.0,Patient,"Exactly yeah. yeah yeah. yeah and because I I loved him so much and like. and I think it is those like red flags where it's like me. i'm wanting to fix them that I could be there, everything, but my bullshit is too much you know, like it's too much because everyone has bullshit it's like whose bullshit, are you willing to put up with. You know what I mean. And it was like when I needed him the most he wasn't there for me yeah I was going through a lot of medical issues, and again I I had surgery this year for endometriosis term of the scar tissue and I have. I have an autoimmune disorder where like I have inflammation in that area with my skin, so they had to remove some of the skin. In order to in order I wouldn't have irritation and wouldn't have inflammation and just ridiculous and again that brings up. a really interesting thing is that because of like my childhood and traumatic things happening, I feel like a lot of like my. Because genetics is affected by environment it's affected by it chance chance it could be yeah luck, of the draw like when you're your genes are going to like switch on and off with certain things and."
480.0,Provider,pregnancy and that's a big one that triggers genetic things that you're like whoa.
14206.0,Patient,"Where that exactly yeah well and then like i've always struggled with like my sexuality, so we were having trouble with that and, like just like struggled with sex in general and just. It just yeah it was. Okay, so here's a lot."
480.0,Provider,"here's something that is. My um. comfort you a little bit in that area sex wise. mm hmm so a lot of people that have had any sort of abuse or have ptsd related to sex or because medical issues like that can make. It painful right so, then I get ptsd from the actual physical pain and a lot of times and i've seen this happen with so many people and myself included. That if you're in a relationship that you don't realize. is unhealthy in certain areas or unsafe in certain areas like you might think that it's completely safe but then after the fact, when you're in a healthy relationship. yeah, then you start to realize that Oh well, that's why I had so many issues with sex is because. Either like."
14206.0,Patient,"Like your Daddy was a narcissist so a lot of times narcissistic abuse really affects your sex life, especially if you have a narcissistic. partner."
480.0,Provider,"Because the gas lighting and constantly making everything your problem, like that really plays into physical intimacy. So it makes a lot of sense, given how you were raised and the relationships that you've had that that would be a. really big area you struggle with but also, I want you to know a lot of people think especially like oh my gosh i'm 2030 years old, and I still can't enjoy sex yeah it's nothing wrong with you it's about your partner and how safe, they are. yeah because a lot of times what happens then is you get into a relationship where your partner is safe. And you suddenly recognize that oh i'm not the one that had a problem my body was responding to the threats that the other person was either subliminally or like there's a lot of factors to it so."
14206.0,Patient,"And I have to remind myself that that's so true like I definitely need to remind myself back because I was putting I was taking a lot of. A lot of just I felt guilty, you know that I couldn't feel a certain way for him and which led me to have a crush on his friend. It was after he said that I gained too much weight that I started drifting away I didn't even think of it until like after I had We broke up that like I drifted away because subliminally I felt like I wasn't enough for him. Exactly, and so, then I was like Why am I feeling like this attraction towards somebody else and not him like Why is that not. something's not right like something's wrong with me like i'm the one that's like. drifting away and being like I never cheated on him, but I I just had a crush on him and I told my ex I was like hey I have this crush and I don't know. Why like I was completely honest with them the entire time and maybe that was too much for him, I think that's why he broke up with me was because he felt like. I was drifting away from him like that I was more focused on somebody else, rather than the relationship and it and in the end, I was blamed for the entire thing. Like and. He went to his friends like saying all this shit and just like. It broke my heart because, like how could they think like the entire time I was with him, I was so nice I was so caring oh so giving and then for just this one thing to then completely I don't know if it changed their minds, I don't know how they feel. Right, so I can't say for sure, but when somebody talk shit about you and they're your you know you have a friend and they're gonna stand up for you, you know, usually unless yeah so it was just. It was really heartbreaking I lost a lot of friendships i've lost friendships even while i've been in California that's a whole other thing i'm I moved five times last year. yeah."
480.0,Provider,i'm from California.
14206.0,Patient,I grew up in California yeah I moved I moved I moved to utah when I just turned 19 because I met my ex ex on minecraft. The video game.
480.0,Provider,And you followed him to utah.
14206.0,Patient,"He was in utah and I went to utah yeah and also it was really like I wanted to get out of this situation, like with my brother like he was more abusive back then, and it was just not a good situation."
480.0,Provider,You guys live together right.
14206.0,Patient,"yeah I live with my mom and my brother right now I just moved back to California, in January, basically, but, like last year I moved, so I moved out of the House with roommates into my friends family's house, then we moved I help them move to new Mexico, then I moved back to utah. into law my ex's house or apartment and then I moved also, mind you okay hold on Let me finish my state and then okay and. Then I moved in with this crazy chick who will I shouldn't call her crazy she had a lot of like mental health issues, but she threatened to call the COPs on me because I told her, I was going to move back to California and she got upset with me, she felt like I was abandoning her. And so, Caroline feel yeah. yeah she threatened to call the COPs on me, and all this shit and so, then I moved back to California and it's just been it was. it's been a whirlwind honestly like. Oh, like I guess it's like more things keep popping in my mind, but um. I yeah like I i'm I what was I gonna say. i'm the job that I had before the job that I really like now, I was a caregiver to like it's she's a she's a family friend, but she was very manipulative she would say like if anything happened to you or if you quit I would just kill myself. Oh. yeah and so she said that to me and she's like I would just let myself go, I would just kill myself because there's no. Like meaning to life and. I was like okay that's a lot on my shoulders and then they she like was like hey I have an emergency and she. She texted me saying I have an emergency and then called me and I called her back and she's like my TV shut off because my I didn't pay my cable bill. And I was like she's like can you pay the bill and i'll pay you back, and I was like Okay, I am just your caregiver I am not your life coach or like your mommy you know what I mean like. i'm here."
480.0,Provider,yeah that's inappropriate definitely.
14206.0,Patient,"It was like so I did I paid her bill I did do it, and I was, I was like. That was just she did eventually pay me back, but like I messaged her that more and I messaged her that morning he's like I can't do this anymore. And like I messaged her i'm like hey I feel like you're taking advantage of my empathy I feel like. This this might have been a mistake i'm not quite sure about this job anymore kind of like that just being honest with her and she just Phillip the Fuck out like. um she flipped out she called me immediately and she's like you sound like you're ready to fight like you sound like you're like ready to like she's like something in US changed like that, like and I just told her i'm like I feel like when you've like manipulated me in some ways and. i'm not willing to put up with that you know and and she like she always she was calling my mom fat like she was calling she told she like describe my mom is a fish that. When head on, she looks skinny But then when she turns to the side, she looks like that which she doesn't but like she was saying that's how she looked like and I was like. you're calling my mom a flounder I cannot believe you just said that, and she would always be late like she she cared about her time more than yours. Like and so. I called ihs us I quit she didn't like I told, she would stay on the phone for freaking hours hours and I like hey i'm gonna have to go the bathroom I am like you know what i'm calling and quitting right now i'm not going to deal with her i'm not going to deal with. Her like staying another two weeks to find another caregiver for her because it's not worth it in my eyes. Like I care about her, but like she's. got a lot issues that I can't fix I can't do with this."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so my new favorite term is emotional self harm so basically you staying in that situation is emotional self harm, because you know exactly what you're getting and it's not worth it emotionally for you."
14206.0,Patient,"Right exactly yeah like the costs and benefits of a relationship, you know and i'm. So I I called ihs s and I told them I quit and they're like okay that's fine and she I told, and then I told her i'm like hey I just quit so. i'm not going to be coming back, and that was when she's like you ruined a 30 year friendship with me and my with your mom and I like your little bitch like you how dare you quit you think you can just quit you can't like you didn't even wait until like all these things, and like."
480.0,Provider,So abusive.
14206.0,Patient,yeah yeah and then i'm just like. What has this year this year has been crazy like it has been.
480.0,Provider,"How do you know why though it's because you're setting boundaries yeah because when you start setting boundaries. People react badly to that, especially the ones that need them set the most."
14206.0,Patient,"yeah that's true yeah that's very true, I think it will and well when my ex broke up with me I literally like had these thoughts of like i'll just kill myself like. And I was thinking like that's not. Healthy like I was thinking to myself, as I was thinking it i'm like I can't believe i've gotten to this point where i'm so low that I am having these thoughts I cried every night for months, like. every night I was a mess like I. I was such a mess and there's he, like it started talking to me a month after again I was willing to give up everything again and then he goes to me. Oh, he just."
480.0,Provider,boasting is the worst. The worst.
14206.0,Patient,place the.
480.0,Provider,"soul and just communicate, I cannot with ghosting I can't."
14206.0,Patient,it's awful it's so awful and alright.
480.0,Provider,So disrespectful in my mind.
14206.0,Patient,I just did yeah.
480.0,Provider,"yeah no Okay, let me ask you this. um with the X and you were suicidal and grieving and all of that. You feel like you were really grieving him or the idea of the family that you were going to have. Like have you thought about the different."
14206.0,Patient,"three. Oh that's so true yeah I, I think that I was, I think I was grieving our future of what it could have been because I he didn't really want kids, but I wanted kids um. And even with my endometriosis I still want kids I think about what that would put me through but also I. And that's the whole other thing um but. yeah."
480.0,Provider,And then Dmitri so.
14206.0,Patient,"it's true yeah I worry about them getting it, though I worry about them getting endometriosis or anything that, but this is the thing. Before I have kids I want to make sure i'm the best version of myself that I could be, and that I don't pass on these. generational traumas to my kids because I would never want them to go through what i've gone through. Like yeah is awful um or what anybody else has gone through you know, like I like having kids not going to fix anything like you got to have a kid when you're ready for it but anyways like."
480.0,Provider,"yeah so on that note, nobody ever feels."
14206.0,Patient,"ready, I know that's true. that's true it's like. Ever yeah that's true."
480.0,Provider,"boy. You just have it, but no I get what you're saying like you want to be the healthiest version of yourself to give them the best opportunity at being for."
14206.0,Patient,"themselves exactly yeah like I don't want to pass on my. insecurities or anything on to them, you know, and I think I would be a good mom but like um yeah I I think I was grieving or future of what. I saw in our future, because I like we liked music We liked adventuring We liked, we had a lot of similarities and I felt like I just found my person, you know. And he also helps me in ways get over someone that not that he knew, but like in my head, I was still having feelings for somebody else. For the longest time but I was like you know what you can't keep it was like two years I had like felt these feelings like a year I don't know something whatever, but I had these feelings for him and. This is another thing that I see with myself happening with relationships I drift away from my partner and. I have feelings for others. and yeah okay like I it's happened every single time that i've been in a relationship."
480.0,Provider,"Especially if the relationship is not safe because that's The thing is, when you get triggered triggered by something you might not even be conscious of it, then that triggers the fight flight mode right so. yeah instead of fighting with your partner you flight in your mind and just like start fantasizing about other things."
14206.0,Patient,"yeah exactly and I noticed that with my ex like. He had even a cute like us like are you cheating on me this is like four or five months in, and I was like are you kidding me like I think the world of you and I. I didn't you know, like I I was like I cannot believe you just in my head i'm like I cannot believe you just asked me that this is like the safest I have felt with somebody and now you're. accusing me of cheating like or asking me if i'm cheating on you."
480.0,Provider,"Well, clearly had some serious insecurities. That were coming up. Like ego trips and jealousy and all of that."
14206.0,Patient,"He had a lot of ego trips like when he would get drunk That was one his ego he was like i'm the best i'm so good at engineering odd like because he's a musician like an audio engineer he's like i'm so good at it like I like he just would like get really like. weird and then and then like you would is just a mess just a mess um but yeah I noticed like these similarities and the relationships that I get into and like. It it can be really frustrating because subliminally it's happening right and like. I did it take it took so long after this relationship to get to where i'm at I will say like it took a lot of bad dates, a lot of like me wanting attention from men for these. Several months I mean I was going on dates, I was going on, like two or three days a week, like. Just. going for it like it was. Like I play what am I doing like I. I realized it once I got to. I went to the doctor's office and I was being tested for us, yes, I think, God didn't have anything but I I was being tested for them and i'm like what am I doing the fact that i'm sitting here. On this Chair worried and not that I hadn't protected myself and sometimes I was just having sex because they wanted it. Not because I want."
480.0,Provider,It you wanted it yeah.
14206.0,Patient,"But because they wanted it and, like I wasn't being an advocate for myself and that's like similar to my mom like oh my God like i'm just repeating certain behaviors you know and like I. I would yeah I wanted to. fix others I wanted I wanted, I want the wanted to do that, so I was doing that and I want to make others happy. You know and but I wasn't thinking about like how I felt in that situation or even my body, you know, like not thinking of my body is something that's sacred. To me, because that that's like morally I feel like my body is sacred like I don't want some weirdo or like some random men using it if i'm not willing to let them are like willing to. write consent to it that, even though I did consent rate like it was consent, but."
480.0,Provider,"You didn't want to that's a difference. Is when you get to a point where you're not people pleasing then it's going to be much easier to say. i'm going home and done. You know, like that's the diff and honestly. dating is a really good opportunity to like shine a light on all of the issues you need to work on."
14206.0,Patient,Because it's so true.
480.0,Provider,yeah. This is like true. it's so. it's just in your face all the time because you're constantly being triggered and you're reacting and it's like new relationships are the time where you don't feel safe yet so all your trauma responses are coming out and so. yeah i'm not.
14206.0,Patient,i'm not sad vacating for all the time.
480.0,Provider,yeah la dating is actually a really it gives you really good insight into. yeah what you need to work on and stuff and boundaries and. it's it yeah.
14206.0,Patient,"yeah it definitely did for a few months I haven't gotten any dates like i've just been working on school and homework or school and work, you know and i'm. But I I feel i'm filling a hole with school and work right, it was dates before and work, but now it's school and work and now i've just completely gone on the opposite end and like get away from me, nobody come near me, you know, like, I only want to deal with it."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so got it yeah and then you have hinge yep tinder you have all these stupid Apps where there's it's going to ego boost our thing."
14206.0,Patient,"They are, and at the same time it's like this is so unhealthy and ways because you're judging someone based off of what they look like in their profile right, but like you start to become. it's just kind of toxic in a way."
480.0,Provider,"it's very I like that you said it's toxic because, for me, I can be on a dating APP for 48 hours and be okay. Anything past 48 hours becomes toxic for me, because I have an addictive personality. I love validation and. it's like in 48 hours, I can meet a few people and get a phone up give my phone number and like I don't want to be dating 500 people at once, you know what I mean."
14206.0,Patient,Like yeah that's fine.
480.0,Provider,"But i'm glad you recognize that because that's something i've really had to set limits for myself if I get on a dating APP, it has to be less than 48 hours because otherwise. I know that it's something in me that's not being satisfied or whatever that i'm seeking validation from these strangers, and like you said it doesn't feel good to be swiping and swiping and be like. Oh he's to this he's to that he's to that you know, like it just doesn't make you feel good."
14206.0,Patient,"No, it does say like it just feel so superficial, you know and and I even was looking at guys and like England, because I was like there's no way they can have sex with me right, so they have to talk to me, you know they have. To talk to me, we have to. build like a relationship, you know, like first before that and. I will, I was talking to this guy in England, for a little while, but like he went into the psychiatric hospital because he was having issues and so he never talks me back and so i'm like is probably better because we're both working on things, and like. I don't know if I can deal with that, right now, and just my kind of what i'm going through you know I don't think I can be strong for him, like and also why am I sacrificing any is just like a whole flood of. thoughts right so. I just realized that that's why I was looking at other guys in different countries, because then I couldn't like there was a."
