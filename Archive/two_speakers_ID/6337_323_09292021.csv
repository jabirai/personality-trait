323.0,Provider,What do you think brothers is about. What do you think your brother silence is about.
6337.0,Patient,"I think he told my dad he was just worried about me, which I understand but he's we just I don't know ever since he's had my son and you're getting ready to adopt him. So I don't know they just ever since he's had grayson we just we haven't been close at all and kind of like toward the whole family apart. Right, his wife like she's never really got along with our family. And she kind of controls everything and my brother says, you know, like if they were to get a divorce, because he has three girls to. Like she's super material I said, like she had to have a brand new friggin suburban when I got my son, so they have more room for the kids and. You know that my own name brand stuff and you know me and my brother said basically if they get a divorce up living in a cardboard box under the. Note taker. She taken for alimony and child support and. Then to brand new vehicles, they own their own House just just stuff like that, so he basically just goes along with everything she says, rather than arguing with her."
323.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6337.0,Patient,"So I know it sucks, but this is."
323.0,Provider,"And she's been kind of some of the block or to you, being able to see your son."
6337.0,Patient,"Absolutely yeah. yeah she. constantly talk shit about me and you know she thinks that. me being an addict i'm like the worst of the worst like what you see on TV basically like I know like scary stuff. Because I know it's never really have been like you can show them services when I had an open case for Greece, then they said that I was a very like functioning addict you mean like they could they could barely even tell when I was on drugs. Because I always held a job and. You know, I was carrying myself and everything. And so it's like I feel like half the time I don't I don't think they think they're scared that they don't even know if i'm you know i'm so using or like that sort of thing like they never really know because they never knew before. So I think there's always just that doubt in their mind and then. I know she said before well it's only a matter of time or you know I messed up again. hmm was set."
323.0,Provider,And how old is grace and now.
6337.0,Patient,"reasons for having five in February yeah. he's in his second year preschool. They wouldn't let him start kind of hard for some reason because he's not applied, yet I guess. um so he's doing his second year preschool but using really good. yeah."
