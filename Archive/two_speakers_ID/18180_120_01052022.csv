120.0,Provider,"Like a meal plan or what what what are you supposed to be eating throughout the day, do you do, you know that yeah."
18180.0,Patient,"Not another bill is she's not just like to assign people who sort amount of food to eat, but just basically constructor constructor basically for the pattern meal pattern, so we have basic idea what to be doing today."
120.0,Provider,"So she's having you keep track of what you're currently eating just to kind of get a baseline of what's going on. Okay um. So. How do you feel about that, so far, do you do you feel like you can like do you like her, do you think you can work with her she's."
18180.0,Patient,"awesome she's already insightful so. yeah definitely but. Yes, diabetes, she has helped me."
120.0,Provider,"Right right you're still kind of figure it out, but it's new. yeah okay and well is there anything in your on your mind today that you wanted to bring up and talk about."
18180.0,Patient,"yeah definitely because of the last week, I certainly have some sentences of like suicidal thoughts, which is our President, but when I look back at when I look back into that the time it was it was kind of farm. Because that day was that there was. That there was low key injuries into me we went out to high mountain and walking the trail, and everyone was having a good time we had dinner together. yeah I don't know what happened, I just feel I just really emotional."
120.0,Provider,Okay.
18180.0,Patient,"So I call the police, the crisis line and talk to a therapist. I talked to a hurry side, I feel every law ignored and. Do the why I wanted to talk to you wave didn't pay. Too much attention on me. But didn't care about me or whatever so stress me out of the bear."
120.0,Provider,You feel like the person on the crisis line wasn't listening to you.
18180.0,Patient,"know not not his prisoner Howard. Okay people, but there is a girl I were how with a song I love to talk with her. She does talk with me and we have our way went to walmart I don't know what happened. I feel North and it's not her fault, by any means, but he's feeling ignored and. yeah."
120.0,Provider,That is definitely a very painful feeling to experience.
18180.0,Patient,"When I look into it, you arrived, because I was having a history in you need to adapt the feeling of being not being carried by people either society is no I don't give a Fuck to whatever people, I think."
120.0,Provider,I have you ever heard of the idea of object permanence have you heard that.
18180.0,Patient,No up. Every library I probably heard of it.
120.0,Provider,"yeah yeah it's a. thing that they talk about in when babies are developing i'm like what you know, like like a young, a young child. there's this thing called the object permanence and really young children, like like, for example of what I have the stapler. And i'm and with a really young child i'd be like look a stapler and they'd be like oh fun, you know and then or they'd see it, and then, if I hide it. If it's not in front of them, then for a young child that doesn't have object permanence yet they're like it's gone like it's gone like they don't know like they they don't look for it, they don't know where it is it's like God. And it's like out of their mind, but then as kids get a little bit older. And they do the same test they get the kids attention and then they hide the toy or whatever it is, then the kid will kind of look around like where to go and they'll kind of look behind their back you know they'll they'll look and see where the toilet and I. Think of that a little bit for you, because I think that, like. Like when you're feeling lonely or ignored. it's like you forget that you're still valuable because you're feeling lonely right now, you know, because you don't always feel like you told me that you have some good friends. Or you know, and I care about you, your parents care about you, Dr Anderson cares about you, Colin cares about you. But when you're feeling lonely and ignored all of a sudden, all of us don't exist anymore to you."
18180.0,Patient,That makes.
120.0,Provider,"Like you forget when you're feeling ignored and lonely you forget that you still are loved even if you're not with somebody or not talking with somebody in that moment. And I think that's based on having a pretty low self esteem, I think that you have a pretty low self esteem and that you kind of become dependent on other people to help you feel worthwhile."
18180.0,Patient,Then they're compliment.
120.0,Provider,"And their couple months yeah. yeah I think that you're kind of you you're living your life, where you constantly need to be kind of reaffirmed. That you are good enough, you know you're always like do they, like me, am I am I do I look good enough to I have a good physique Am I smart enough I my you're always kind of trying to prove yourself a little bit."
18180.0,Patient,"But. At the end of the day, my improvement console into. What I feel the past."
120.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. yeah yeah yeah like when you when you feel that you are proving yourself, when you feel like you're you know thin enough or that you're strong enough or that you, you know. Have whatever it is that you think people want to see, and then you feel good, but then, you know as soon as like. Somebody says something that kind of shakes you a little bit you know, like like the comment, the person made at the gym That was something to the effect of starting a cat is really insistent on being involved um. You know, when someone says something to you about all you're not making progress or you're plateaued or you know they make comments about things, you know that, like destroys you because. you're so thirsty you're so dependent on for that feedback that you're good enough. Does that does that make sense about why that happens, I think I really do think that's part of what the issue is for you is that I think that you um. You don't have enough emotional battery straight to like say you know, like a cell phone you plug it in, and it pulling power from like you're from a charger right. And, but if you unplug it, it has to have some battery power to keep it going. You know, but you're kind of like an old cell phone that won't stay charge, you have to keep plugging it in because it doesn't have enough to carry on its own, and I think that you're very dependent on other people. You know, to to feel valuable and so I think what you really need to work on is being kind to yourself and being your own friend. You know, to start seeing the value in yourself, you know."
18180.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"I mean, what do you think, give somebody work, I mean do you do, do you value you love your parents."
18180.0,Patient,Of course.
120.0,Provider,"Okay, why."
18180.0,Patient,I used to not let my mother and then much it was to a hater bit. Because choose to be mass the mass off.
120.0,Provider,it's pretty mean to you.
18180.0,Patient,"yeah but her parents, he the same. Obvious even though, even though feel gays keep my birth of my birth, they still will be mass he find these on the wrong. yeah my my my parents. way much that before. I know. it's growing with time it's growing with time. Absolutely, people are to have peace when when my mom everything is fine, everything is chill. yeah."
120.0,Provider,"Are there any other people in your life that you really care about that are like that you like, you know that you value or that you. Like like maybe a professor, like a teacher or a friend or somebody who you know was kind to you. I don't I don't know I don't know all the people in your life and so i'm not sure like if you have anybody that you really feel like close to or is it pretty are you pretty distance from everybody."
18180.0,Patient,"I hope way, I hope I can have some someone that I value and a pre pressures about but it's very hard to find a person be because, because the societies, like the older get the nonlinear again. The last friends to be and the more depressive will be. Like your friends circle become smaller and as Bonner. When you aging. And i'm only not not even 20, but I feel, but I feel the sense of. Most people are not most people are not the one who will give their at put their ass on fire, for you. Now, oh my parents."
120.0,Provider,"that's been a year experience, because I have a different experience in my life, you know, but I get that that's that's the experience that you're having you know I mean that does sound very, very sad and I can see why you would feel you know depressed about that."
18180.0,Patient,yeah when you have someone you can trust boy is. enough for me yeah.
120.0,Provider,"For me it's just it's my neighbors it's people around me, but in my. I feel like like i'm not i'm not dating i'm not married I don't want to be. But I am content, you know because I have like I have good neighbors that I can talk to, or whatever and. But I think that. That whoa you know what you said about like that your friend your your kind of social network get smaller, I think, as you get older, I think that there is some truth to that. But I also think that it gets better like because the people that stay in your life are the ones that are quality people."
18180.0,Patient,yeah I feel he.
120.0,Provider,Was.
18180.0,Patient,y'all feel to you how those tracks.
120.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and also as people get. Older people mature and you've you know you're so young, the primary people you hang out, you know that you've known are also really immature and young and, as you get older it gets easier, in my opinion."
18180.0,Patient,"Like there, there are hardly anyone can really give you our talk with. Because they're already really care about what you're going through what went through. The the best situation is they try to come to you. But they cannot solve the problem unless you use a real problem."
120.0,Provider,"You know everyone is capable of solving their own problems, just like I can't solve your problems and you can't sell. I have. You know, you know, but I can value, you and I can try to support you."
18180.0,Patient,"Thanks mama mama told me Kobe the exact same media, as you can be like the. What color the subject to permanence no mom told me the so are similar metaphor. So I feel that way because I I look back into my future I think i'm i'm not bad, though, the battle at least about marriage. So yeah any improvement that is for myself, even though I want to work on, be a better shape it's just for myself, not necessarily for no my house it's a byproduct is not necessarily the motivation, it can be but. it's not a whole picture, so I don't know why I feel that way another day but. You just triggered me a lot. But I look back into I think he's ridiculous now worthy and nobody."
120.0,Provider,"What do you think, give somebody worth."
18180.0,Patient,What was that.
120.0,Provider,"What what gives somebody worth like what, how do you like if if I went into a. newborn baby at the hospital the hospital where there's a bunch of newborn babies. Do you think that they have any worth."
18180.0,Patient,I think everyone doesn't have price because money just paper everyone's prize he speaks on their time. and their rights.
120.0,Provider,"But do you think that, like if if there was a little baby that was born, that we should just throw it away."
18180.0,Patient,No.
120.0,Provider,need someone to take care of it like it needs to be it has a valuable it's valuable like not not in a Monday not not value or worth in money not in not in money. But in in like. Because in love like somebody because it deserves to be loved.
18180.0,Patient,I respect that. respect that.
120.0,Provider,"So um because when you were born, you had worth from the second you were born. You have you looked you hadn't done anything, yet you know, besides cried you know you had done anything to earn it, you know you were its inherent meaning, you were born with it and you still have that you're still valuable. You know, have worth not not in a financial sense because it's a different thing, but in the sense that. You that you were you were born with it. lost track of that, I think that you've I think that society and your life experiences have taught you that you're not worth anything."
18180.0,Patient,"i'm. Not just come just a pure pure comparison, maybe feel down. And yeah this is headed to find that but it's not necessarily my education forward, I think, education is great, at least. But trying to compare myself. To at and others it's not a good idea, you know."
120.0,Provider,"They say compare and despair. If you compare it always leads to despair, it always leads to feeling bad. yeah because there will always be people in your life that you see yourself as less than you will always there's always going to be somebody who. You know, looks better or has more friends or makes more money, or you know, whatever or makes better grade you know but there's always people that are less. Like that have less than you do that there's people that don't have you know resources to go to college there's people who are living in poverty. You know there's people who can't use their legs I work at the hospital to and every you know, every time I work there, it i'm really grateful that my body works."
18180.0,Patient,"yeah so yeah. yeah doors shut surgery last year. yeah before surgery. She we should we as. A race every her close friend. He his job. He you know her job arrow or whatever and and the time I feel satisfied my mom but fortunately everything's everything's fine she's she's healthy right now. Now the deal and but the moment Richard me alive, because when people is going to is going to go to go through something big in their life. We you know, we need to pressures, while we have right now yeah yeah."
120.0,Provider,"And that and that's it, you know, reminding yourself of of the blessings that you have already in your. Life having gratitude that can really help with not comparing against a way I have a pretty good you know, compared to. Some other people, you know and sometimes that that can help when you're feeling really down is to to lead."
18180.0,Patient,"So and it's a I to walk beside say the girl is tied to my friend who walk out with me, because you probably have better looking better physique the girl just keep talk with him, you know, sometimes I disagree I didn't really speak out. Even though I know I probably know more. by any means. I want me i'm studying nutrition science. But there I just feel there is no people that just feel like most people care about the results so they go ask the people have good to resolve, instead of people really dig dig digging deep inside the cell. So the girl keeps talk with me and make me jealous. A bit. I know."
120.0,Provider,"yeah do you have any other like social networks, besides people that at the gym like you have any other."
18180.0,Patient,"Most my most my friends will go to the gym. Okay, you sad."
120.0,Provider,"cuz i'm like well, I think one of the best ways that you're going to meet people and make. Good quality friends, because it's not they're not just going to come to you obviously you know it takes work to meet people, but as to get involved in a club of some sort like like a student a student organization like do they have like an Asian club or something like that on campus."
18180.0,Patient,Who do they have. yeah definitely they have.
120.0,Provider,"Because, like you, you kind of I think you need like more people that you know to meet you need to interact more like I know when I was in school, I was always involved in animal clubs like I did horses I competed enforces things like that, and all of the friends that I have. I would say almost all of them i'm friends with because of animals because of we have something in common is far worse, whatever, and so I think that the best way you're going to find people that value you for you. Are is going to be you're going to have to start trying to you know go to different events like like a social events or. Like I know the university, I was involved with frequently had a service groups where you would get together and do a service project for for like another country or. For you know, like going in volunteering somewhere, as a group, like at the food bank or whatever and. I don't know I just think that if you, you might if you have some more connections by kind of getting yourself involved in those things or or in school like I don't know in your major, are there any like nutrition science clubs or."
18180.0,Patient,"Mina amanda. I mean, though."
120.0,Provider,Oh you're already in it okay good do they get together and do stuff.
18180.0,Patient,Sometimes.
120.0,Provider,"Okay, do you try to attend one they do."
18180.0,Patient,"yeah me to attend one meeting and LEADER I don't have time to work but. But the collapse of way, like any association or any any occasion. i'm involved with. I don't find and the one people really seeking conversation with you and a little why."
120.0,Provider,They can take years to to form a relationship or somebody where you can have deeper conversations.
18180.0,Patient,yeah probably over four years in college and that's it.
120.0,Provider,"I mean you'll if you keep going and you build friendships first, then you know that gradually usually leads to deeper conversations that are more."
18180.0,Patient,"meaningful and in one class is Hague sociology class, we have to do dog position, and then I don't know you know, even though that I don't know that either by these. sounds or a meaningful stuff to do and era cars, there is a girl she's even Asian America, I talked to her several times at the beginning of the Semester is suddenly she just stopped talking with me, I have no fucking clue."
120.0,Provider,"What I mean and the thing about, that is, you know when when that kind of stuff happens it's super painful, but you have to remember to it, not might not be you. Because it's very possible that that girl has stuff going on in her life that it's not about you, you know that she's experiencing some hard stuff in her life and that she's withdrawing. Not. As if you, but because of her."
18180.0,Patient,yeah I don't know what's been going on with her.
120.0,Provider,yeah he just you don't know until you have to be really cautious to not immediately judge it.
18180.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah definitely you will be was taught home with me suddenly. I don't know what's going on is there are several times, having to me."
120.0,Provider,"yeah you're not the only one that happens to a lot of people it's it's that that's why like when I was talking about like emotional battery you know, like at a phone. You know you have to be able to have enough kind of emotional battery inside of yourself, so that when someone stops talking to you, it doesn't cause you to feel so down. You know."
18180.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"So you have to kind of find some things within yourself that you value, what do you care about for yourself like do you, what do you value in yourself."
18180.0,Patient,"Okay Obama health care about if I can spend time, if I can spend quality time. If I have friends. You have religious you if i'm going to grow more family in the future if Erica you could, if I can achieve financial freedom."
120.0,Provider,"What, what do you like about yourself not not you're not like physical but is there something there anything you qualities, you have that you like that you think you do that you're something that you consider to be a benefit for you."
18180.0,Patient,Like socializing.
120.0,Provider,Do you think you're.
18180.0,Patient,"Wrong yeah like that, like like death jokes. and"
120.0,Provider,humor.
18180.0,Patient,Probably yeah.
120.0,Provider,"Okay, so you're funny you like to laugh, do you think that you're kind to people and and help like the underdog like support other people, and like. Be those qualities that you have."
18180.0,Patient,"I feel my kind of this, but I feel no one way to really realize it, I appreciate. I appreciate I have kindness I don't do. Island to anything ego. yeah I have good, I think. you're a good person yeah good morality, but there were really care about it."
120.0,Provider,That you have to care about it that's what i'm saying is other people don't care about you have to figure out how to care about you.
18180.0,Patient,"I do, but i'm not leaving without people i'm leaving with all kinds of. People. So yeah, it is very hard for me at least to adapt to nowadays. I have the opportunity, my parents, oh no my you want town has but also face the issue probably few people face as well as me my town. I admire my friends who involving a good a good religions you've got to have friends who have numerous friends and. Who can basically how every day, not every day most days. But yeah. I always a trade off over there, whatever."
120.0,Provider,"and Think through a little bit more about what happened last last week, when you were feeling suicidal you were were you with people and then he said he went hiking."
18180.0,Patient,There we went hiking.
120.0,Provider,And he. said that was fun or not.
18180.0,Patient,"it's all right will basically talk and talk. Whenever and we went to all the garden, which is crap."
120.0,Provider,You don't like all garden.
18180.0,Patient,"My place is OK, for the genome out for you. At some point. But my friends this sucks. They don't know how to order."
120.0,Provider,They didn't like what they got.
18180.0,Patient,And we went to warm or some shopping. So yeah so what happened just fine.
120.0,Provider,"So then, where you went What did you start feeling really bad after you went home or when did you start feeling really bad."
18180.0,Patient,"I felt bad what called the warm up I don't know. The moment just have a really, really quick. and basically they're not as a friend contact with B. O R E mo that's a no i'm fine."
120.0,Provider,"They noticed that you are, you seem to off, you are sad. yeah because one of the things that i'm. i'm gonna bring this to see if I can bring up this. Little worksheet that I wanted to show you. who's trying to find it here. So um. Alright, let me share this. So this is. A list of this, so it says sorry, this is what what triggered me, and so you experienced that day I trigger of some sort something that kind of triggered those those really, really dark feelings. yeah and so that's why I kind of wanted to ask you if you can identify what what kind of was the catalyst what kind of got that going, what was the trigger, and this is a list of some common ones. um. I One of them said that says, I felt excluded and you told me, you were feeling ignored, which I think is great that you identified that that says, I feel excluded, I felt powerless, I felt unheard. I felt school did I felt judged, I felt blamed. destructive disrespected a lack of affection, I felt like I couldn't speak up, I felt lonely ignored you that's the word you used. So it's on this list."
18180.0,Patient,Yes.
120.0,Provider,"I felt I couldn't be honest, I felt like the bad guy I felt forgotten, I felt unsafe, I feel unloved I felt like it was unfair, I felt frustrated disconnected. I felt trapped, I felt the lack of passion, I felt uncared, for I felt manipulated, I felt controlled so Those are just some common ones people tend to feel. And so um. When when you're feeling like suicidal or you're feeling as low as you or feeling in that moment well one one way to help yourself if you want to help yourself, is to try to identify. One of these like what what is it what is it that i'm feeling that's leading to these bad feelings what like what is it that i'm feeling that's making me feel like I want to die. And, and then, when I can understand it like when I. When I can recognize what i'm feeling like feeling ignored, like you, experienced um how do I take care of myself in that, and you did a good job, by calling the the crisis line that was awesome and i'm glad that you did that. That you produce something to help yourself there. And, but there's other things you can do to like. You know, calling another friend like I know you said you don't have a lot of close friends, but I would be willing to bet that if you. You know some of those people that you went hiking with they invited you to go, I mean to they must, like you, or you knew about it, so you must they must see you as part of the Friendship Group. So you probably you might be thinking we might come on to them and say hey can we, you know i'm having kind of a hard night, can you talk for a minute or can we watch a movie or something i'm feeling pretty lonely and just see what they say. Good I know it would be weird it's weird if you're not used to having those conversations."
18180.0,Patient,decide I have.
120.0,Provider,My white.
18180.0,Patient,arrow is going home I don't think it's going to happen. And I certainly did I use and. Others to so my issues.
120.0,Provider,"To solve it, I mean, but what they can do is listen this that that whole point of. The whole point of i'm. reaching out is not because someone's going to solve it, but so that you don't feel as alone."
18180.0,Patient,In terms as not alone it but don't feel. don't feel like. It is what happens.
120.0,Provider,"Okay. um I wanted to ask you some more about your suicidal thoughts are those still are you still feeling that now, or is that kind of passed."
18180.0,Patient,"know that at all, not. feel so proud in chat here this week."
120.0,Provider,"You feel you said, to say that again you feel extra energetic."
18180.0,Patient,yeah I feel surprise getting.
120.0,Provider,This week look really sad to me you come across as looking really sad.
18180.0,Patient,"know if you say it is memorial team, you will be shocked."
120.0,Provider,"Okay, so um but laugh, but the last week kind of out of the blue, you had suicidal thinking is that kind of way, am I understanding that right."
18180.0,Patient,Moses see you again.
120.0,Provider,"Well, you said that you've been feeling really good, but then last week, you were feeling suicidal is that right."
18180.0,Patient,One day.
120.0,Provider,"Just one day. Okay, do you have a plan of how you would hurt yourself."
18180.0,Patient,No idea.
120.0,Provider,"You don't you haven't thought of a plan or something like that. Because I think it's really good that to have. To be aware of those of those feelings, so that when they do pop up, you know how to handle them and i'm i'm really proud of you for calling the crisis line that was. That was smart and there's other things you know what other things, do you think you can do if you're feeling unsafe to yourself."
18180.0,Patient,idea.
120.0,Provider,So what about like going for a jog or taking a nap taking a shower Those are all things that can help you to process those those emotions when they're when they are there.
18180.0,Patient,"Oh, you said, the. method to mitigate by so you."
120.0,Provider,know I mean like I will ask you originally if you had a plan of how you would kill yourself.
18180.0,Patient,I know. If you have. My weakness is I will do anything without. Like. i'm a hasty person.
120.0,Provider,"You have access to any firearms any guns. All right, um because what when you're having a hard time it's it's really a good idea to. If you have things around you that you that might be lethal to you that might kill you that you get it out of the House like so that you don't have access to it because, like you said that you get impulsive then that's not a good thing."
18180.0,Patient,that's food come.
120.0,Provider,Food no. I would much rather you binge eat then hurt yourself.
18180.0,Patient,"No, I don't have anything happened to me."
120.0,Provider,"Okay, good um but there but there's also um. There there's also the other kind of like when I asked about if you have any suicide plans, I also like to ask what are your living plants like how, what are your plans to help yourself. When you're in that that dark spot so that's why I suggested, you know going for a jog or taking a shower because sometimes if you're going to take a shower or take a nap or something like that that can help switch your emotion, a little bit so it's not so dark."
18180.0,Patient,So I want you to take those yeah so.
120.0,Provider,yeah like distract.

120.0,Provider,"Like emotional first aid so when you're having a really you know when you're in pain emotional pain, where you're thinking about suicide that sort of thing. um how are you going to keep yourself safe, and so you know I I think it's important to write those things down like what are you going to do to help yourself when you're feeling suicidal so. Like you mentioned marching YouTube that's a great one or I like to play card games on my phone like solitaire whatever I, like you know those kinds of things are fun for me. Or you know i'm. Basically, you got to find ways to. Help yourself get through that time without hurting yourself."
18180.0,Patient,yeah I feel my mental mental is so tough. You know. Business yeah they see this shitty situation. yeah yeah.
120.0,Provider,"And so. When you're in that spot so like say you um. You know, say you're you're feeling suicidal all of a sudden, you know what one thing you could do is look like look at this list. And figure out what it is that you're feeling and you already did that you are identified that you felt ignored. Then, and so, then after you kind of recognize that, then you then you have compassion for yourself, you be kind to yourself and say, instead of thinking about killing myself let's think about how to sue my pain. So, like one thing you can you know and food is one of those things people will use food. You know, like you know, sometimes have something that makes you feel better but and that's one of the problems that you have, and so we want to try to not do that, but I would rather you do that, then kill yourself."
