214.0,Provider,"When you say the same, what do you mean the same so she doesn't want you to see the kids."
13550.0,Patient,yeah as it hasn't changed in years.
214.0,Provider,"So right so. How, how are you trying to manage that, or you can't."
13550.0,Patient,"I mean, I still try to see them. Even though. She says no and stuff I still, as you know, i'm still going to try and I went to court, not too long ago and got more parenting time with them. And i'm working on moving closer to them, so I could go for half custody, so that I don't have to deal with you know, asking her or trying to go through her to do to be in my children's lives."
214.0,Provider,And how does that make you feel that you've got to go to a legal channel to get what's rightfully yours.
13550.0,Patient,and makes me feel like that's not right.
214.0,Provider,"But if i'm not mistaken, she suffers from some mental health right."
13550.0,Patient,yeah she. she's been admitted to a mental hospital before and gotten treatment there and whatnot so.
214.0,Provider,Do you think she's a danger to your children her children.
13550.0,Patient,I. Think she's a danger to them now.
214.0,Provider,"So in in your mind now what she says, what do you think this withholding of the children's about."
13550.0,Patient,I think it's about her. Blaming me for the problems in her life and. Not having any emotional intelligence and being very childish throwing a fit that's what I think it's about.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, and do you think the children suffer through this."
13550.0,Patient,"Now, of course. Okay yeah."
214.0,Provider,"How, how would the courts change some of that feel."
13550.0,Patient,"Well, now that I knew that i'm moving closer, I think that maybe I could get half custody. You know and. Not have to deal with this anymore, hopefully."
214.0,Provider,How old do they know.
13550.0,Patient,My my daughter is five my son is seven.
214.0,Provider,Right so yeah I mean you've got you know a little bit of ways.
13550.0,Patient,before they can make calls on their own. they're still young.
214.0,Provider,Are they so let me I got every role just something I was about to say cuz i'm not sure I heard of I have you not seen your children.
13550.0,Patient,"No, I see them I just dropped them off actually back to their mom. Half an hour ago but. No, I there was a time. Back in well about two years ago I went about a year and a half, without seeing them because she just wouldn't let me. And I had to go I finally gave up on just asking her or you know, trying to. show up at her house just to. Try to say it my keys or. Talk to her that I just decided to go to court and. Have the judge deal with it that's what happened, which you know anything we would have to do that, but. Apparently, you know that's what it's going to take."
214.0,Provider,"So you're you're going to go into family court. I have you talk to a lawyer, about the proceedings and the outcomes and the risks and the benefits."
13550.0,Patient,"I didn't get a lawyer, I went on my own."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, see you per se, did you did you Okay, so the Clerk i'm assuming help help you filled out the paperwork."
13550.0,Patient,And I had a couple questions your new yeah.
214.0,Provider,"Not fair enough fair enough. So this has to be very upsetting to you to try to figure out. One not only to see children more often, but having to go through a legal recourse but. It doesn't sound like you're not a strategical person to me it sounds like you, are strategical So my question is what happens if this backfires."
13550.0,Patient,"and walk away, what do you mean."
214.0,Provider,"What what listen whatever secret she's got you got I mean that's just that's just who we are, as people what happens if the judge doesn't see your way and actually find you to be more of a risk."
13550.0,Patient,that's not I don't think that's.
214.0,Provider,"Kidnapping okay my job. is just to bring things to the table, I don't want to. Read. You like I don't want you to be like yo dude like you could at least like gave me a heads up. i've done enough to these battery clusters close to these and family court to know they don't always go the way we wanted to go and certain things we couldn't have seen. That the judges feels one way blah blah blah i'm just saying it's good that you at least hear things so if they do happen it won't be such a turn of the table. Right and. So you have stable housing you've got stable employment you've got character references."
13550.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,and have they set a court date yet.
13550.0,Patient,"No, I haven't gone back to court, yet we settle what was going on, we settled it about two three months ago now. and Ever since then i've been working on moving closer to my children."
214.0,Provider,I gotcha okay. So you got you having a little bit of a plan yeah but but is this a verbal agreement or court agreement.
13550.0,Patient,what's been established so far.
214.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
13550.0,Patient,it's a quarter agreement. Okay yeah.
214.0,Provider,But you're still seeking more it's kind of what i'm hearing is that accurate.
13550.0,Patient,i'm starting to think about it yeah. yeah.
214.0,Provider,And what what is the thought process on why this should happen.
13550.0,Patient,"Because I, I see that my children need their father, not just their mother, they need their father and without their father it's it's gonna it's gonna affect them in a bad way in the future, especially and. that's not good."
214.0,Provider,"What i'm trying to get at is, and I want to make sure is there's no ulterior motives right we're not doing it arbitrarily we're not doing it to be vindictive we're doing it solely in the best interest of the children."
13550.0,Patient,"it's my it's my children I she could you know she could. I could let her believe that she's won the whole being in her head or whatever, if she wants to pretend like this is a game, but to me this isn't a game, this is not. i'm not here to play a game i'm here to make sure my children and a good, you know healthy minded people in the future, not. You not you win some kind of game. I feel actually that's that's I feel that's the way that her and her parents are handling the situation that they they are playing some kind of game against me it's not it's not like that this isn't a game good. i've given up on trying to talk to her or convince her of anything."
214.0,Provider,"I think that's a good idea, because before you get some charges pressed against you, which ain't gonna look pretty. impressed you just back out of the whole thing and stay clean meaning, you know we don't need a tiara on file we don't need anything going into the judge where. You know there's a great cloud, so we need to just worry about that my concern is, are you ready to have more responsibilities for your children."
13550.0,Patient,yeah I am.
214.0,Provider,"So then. The move the move is you know being being getting ahead of the curve, in order to have more visitation so you're closing it's not such a drain on you right. And and who's holding you up to this whole time Oscar like is it just you do, you have friends, you have family like who's who's telling you you're on your right path."
13550.0,Patient,"I have a couple friends and family like my sister and my mom I still talk to my dad which lives in Mexico, but I I talked to him on the phone. My uncle also I talked to him. Well yeah I mean i'm not i'm not looking to take the kids from her or anything like that."
214.0,Provider,"And and clearly. Clearly, see you've established, something that the Court needs to know see you've never ever indicated any malice. This is, then, I was trying to get that from you, before because that's what you proven to me and the mere fact that you came out and just blown Lee said it, which is listen I don't want to stop whatever's going on with the month, but I just need to be more involved. i'm not here right, and I think that's super cool, but I also think that that's important for the judge to know you know that whatever is going on. between children and mothers should continue, but as a father, you need to participate more you have a desire to give them more of a whole a stable home presence right Those are all the judge is gonna want to hear from you okay. how's work been."
13550.0,Patient,"Work has been pretty good I just started this job, not just a couple weeks ago so it's new. But it's going good and. Learning lie. My plan is to learn as much as I can, as fast as possible and buy all the tools, I needed, so I can move on, on my own. Doing construction So hopefully I can start doing some remodels you know bathroom and kitchen remodels on my own to make more money. Because I am working for somebody else right now."
214.0,Provider,"I totally get that. I will listen again, one of the things that you've got to realize is. wanting something isn't enough, there has to be a plan to get to the want there's got to be actions is going to be executions, people can talk about things all day long. I want to do this, no wonder that they're just never going to do them, so you know, every time you speak. About obtaining something you have a plan how to obtain it, so the idea here is that's the way you need to continue to be structured and focus, because if it all goes well, you may have more time with the children, which means. You need to have more flexible, excuse me with working so you can provide them the time they need, because you won't be able to be working and then not have a parent at home right because that's probably going to be one of the arguments from the other side."
13550.0,Patient,I don't think it will be too much of a problem i'll still be working regular work hours.
214.0,Provider,"Well that's always acceptable, but if they turn into be longer and you know the chosen are and care for it becomes the question that the judge has to consider. When he's thinking about what's in the buses of children is it a mother this stays home all day or father who's although motivated seems like all he wants to do is be there for his children but won't be able to be there as much as the mother it'll go towards the mother. sister when."
13550.0,Patient,She works also.
214.0,Provider,"Oh, so that so so i'm just i'm just providing you would equal opportunity arguments if they arise. When they say you can't watch the kids say, well, she can't watch me the so you know. And this is good way to have a discussion for your prep So what are you going to do you have to go back and file more paperwork."
13550.0,Patient,"If I want to if I want to get another hearing then yeah I need to go fall for another hearing then start the process back over again. i'm in the process of moving i'm still living kind of far away from them, but in a couple weeks here i'll be living closer to them so maybe after that."
214.0,Provider,"I, I think that that's a good move don't don't do something when you're far away because that'll be the edge of song record you're better off having big song record be closer, so no one can argue about you know how's he gonna make this happen, look what he's done and. so on and so on. how's your mood been."
13550.0,Patient,"it's been all right. i'm staying positive I just I still I find myself once in a while. And wanting to try to fix fix things or find a way to fix things between her and I. And, especially because my know my kids want that so bad, but they always make hits to me and. They make little comments here and there, where I know they want us to be a family, but in my mind it's it's we're nowhere near that happening right now so. I mean, I find myself wanting to try to find a way to fix it, but at the same time I tell myself well it's not going to happen so but I have a hard time."
214.0,Provider,"But remember you're at the one stage if that becomes a need that's going to create a more of a problem, what i'm saying is everybody wants. Not everybody needs so you don't need to get back to her i'm assuming this variable reasons why this is in productive today. But there's a desire, she was your partner, she was a significant others, she has children will you like, I totally respect the one part. um but the want is what makes it different than a need. And, and what i'm saying is you know we want all kinds of things that that's just not going to be in the cards of present day. We can always change things from wants to needs as we move in life, but this will maybe best the way it is right now, because if you're going to sacrifice yourself. To be home with the children and and be a significant other who maybe is not going to be loved or cared for, or or properly acknowledged then you're going to bear that price and it's just going to be reflective on the whole family."
13550.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,"You know, and sometimes you just can't make things right, I know that's a difficult one, but sometimes not everything can be made right sometimes things have to stay broken. I know you do, and I know you do and that's what I like that word want makes me makes me just want to reiterate that sometimes things have to remain broken we're not the ones to fix them something else has to. take place before we can be in a place where we can continue to fix like that's the be other things going on, that a greater. Right and then maybe something can happen so i'm thinking, all you gotta do is you know just try to be patient and always look at you know this looks this way, but it could always be this way like always look at two sides of a coin, so you never get blindsided by any decision. You know i'm saying. So I so let's just read read rehash so to get on to see me, you have to go to the virtual clinic."
13550.0,Patient,Every time.
214.0,Provider,"Every time but here's something that maybe ain't that great could be you can sign in the day before early in the morning for a late plan for late session. So yo yo seven o'clock in the morning, you can call up for an 8pm session or 5pm session already you don't have to call right before the session, you can check in. A day before, to 12 hours before.
