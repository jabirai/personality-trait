18461.0,Patient,"Yes, absolutely I mean I understand it's a process and I didn't have a lot of basis about what was making me sleepy because you know the way I got here. The fact that I kind of started taking them all at once. yeah, but they do vary from a quality of life perspective, I have noticed that, beyond heavy amount of sedation because outside of everything else I like to feel like doing is sleeping or having no energy to do anything. Which Okay, the weight gain substantial."
505.0,Provider,"Yes, Jonathan listen let's i'm gonna ask you a lot of questions but i'm so glad you're here and the medications are on in the hospital. may not be the right medicine for you in real life, trying to have a life and do things and and you know have it energy. So let's look at you know humor me here, while I ask you some kind of background questions you were in the hospital tell me in your own words, what brought you to the hospital."
18461.0,Patient,"And what happened with the hospital was. I was pretty much having the delusion and imagine or hallucination of some sort where I one well the basis what got me there and they just put it in plain terms, it was that I was in the neighbors apartment. That I first mistaken it's my own and believed was my own."
505.0,Provider,mm hmm.
18461.0,Patient,"And she was and I guess, I was responding or very. Very. what's the word despondent and the way I replied and said something along the lines of my father and all the other houses, I live in, or something like that. Okay that's what got me to the hospital that time."

18461.0,Patient,"right and it wasn't the same exact reason, but it was."
505.0,Provider,"Similar okay so Jonathan you anyway, have you previously had any times, where you had delusional thoughts, you were hearing things you were seeing things people felt like you are a little off."
18461.0,Patient,"i've never felt, where I was hearing things you're seeing things or anything but definitely the. The last part came towards the point of abusing alcohol."
505.0,Provider,"Ah, OK, this part Supreme Court and Jonathan I work addiction medicine, as well as like listen be honest so was alcohol, a part of both of these hospital admissions."
18461.0,Patient,"Yes, you know i'm trying to remember, if one of them was not like the truth is, I have to say yes, because it was drinking both times."
505.0,Provider,hmm.
18461.0,Patient,I don't know the levels because it kind of you know what I mean so.
505.0,Provider,So. Where are you with alcohol Jonathan are you drinking daily Is this something that's been difficult for you.
18461.0,Patient,It was somewhat difficult though it kind of crept up on me. um I went to rehab for two months.
505.0,Provider,"To try, though, you did. She went to rehab when was that."
18461.0,Patient,January 2020 January 25.
505.0,Provider,"Okay, so were you sober for a period of time and then you started training King again yeah. yeah the pandemic has done that. Right it's very kind of rough."
18461.0,Patient,"And now i'm in a psychiatric supportive living situation after that, just to get used to the meds and then i'm moving to a sober house. At say. Just because I know the you know mental illness does run in my family, so it was harder for me to. grasp of what was going on with me."
505.0,Provider,Okay. Just excellent.
18461.0,Patient,"i've never had that happen or you know when you can't you know that word for when you can't tell it, you have it."
505.0,Provider,"Reality testing you didn't have any reality kind of testing. So. That I can this part is also important, I heard you say. you're in a psychiatric housing situation right in the Community, or are you in a facility."
18461.0,Patient,it's. it's it's affording supportive living situation like a. kind of like apartments a couple of minutes.
505.0,Provider,"Okay do F staff there with. You Okay, so do you have staff who hand you your medication or do it okay gotcha and did a live there 24 hours a day."
18461.0,Patient,"They are here 24 in this place 24 hours i'm only here for a moment, while I get everything settled, and the next place i'm doing is a sober living house where they still have a house manager that I myself or I can have that has managed to do it."
505.0,Provider,"Okay gotcha This is great that you are doing what it takes to stay, you know clean sober and get your mental health on track time within. This is this is good Cisco are you um tell me about some medicine, first of all, what medications are you on right today."
18461.0,Patient,"Well, one they gave me the in Vegas shot. I think it was sustainable and i'm not sure, maybe it's trends 100%."
505.0,Provider,It could be whenever you get three of those.
18461.0,Patient,"So look at trends it because it was my first time on it, and I was. Like because I haven't really had a full on diagnosis conversation with anyone I just kind of let things up, based on the medications I was taking and what I saw in some of the initial paperwork, which was something along the lines of schizo effective bipolar."
505.0,Provider,"Okay, so with the trends are Jonathan, this is a three month shot is your understanding your government got this injection every three months."
18461.0,Patient,"that's what the doctor said, but when I looked up how it was processing it's every two months after your first successful treatment. of a few months so i've been getting it once a month."
505.0,Provider,"I see now here's a challenge, do you know your job, it might have been 156 cutter event. Money i'm not 100% certain honestly on that."
18461.0,Patient,"I want, if I don't want to guess guess it does because."
505.0,Provider,"that's okay. You, let me know when you sort that out so you're not."
18461.0,Patient,nervous I know my next shot is on the 21st ish.
505.0,Provider,"Okay, good do you have access to this shot in your community. Who is going to give that to you."
18461.0,Patient,"Actually, this place is going to take me to the provider."
505.0,Provider,"Okay excellent because I have not figured out how to give an injection over telemedicine. Right right. And this is a very effective very, very expensive medication, so if you have access to it awesome I want you to get keep with us what other medicines are you on for site."
18461.0,Patient,"Well, the other meditations i'm on our lexapro. depakote. And there is one more than I am just blanking on."
505.0,Provider,Next to the lexapro. risperidone oh OK OK let's start at the top lexapro what is that out.
18461.0,Patient,That I don't know I only see it when they bring me the paper to sign.
505.0,Provider,yeah I understand but.
18461.0,Patient,Like it's five milligrams I could be missing a could be and then do you have any idea what your depakote 50.
505.0,Provider,"good job, how many times today."
18461.0,Patient,"who say, no one. Okay, so i'm assuming it's a little circular white pill."
505.0,Provider,yeah it's a that's a really.
18461.0,Patient,Good twice a day.
505.0,Provider,Would it be to pills twice a day.
18461.0,Patient,twice a day.
505.0,Provider,One pill twice a day. How about that risperdal what's to douse.
18461.0,Patient,"The rest we don't do is. Remember, I don't listen to these after tonight yeah."
505.0,Provider,don't I understand it's it would be maybe one milligram two milligrams three. four.
18461.0,Patient,And I thought it was five but I thought that was.
505.0,Provider,I might have bet them lexapro. So the risk for dog do you take at one time a day or twice a day.
18461.0,Patient,I believe it's twice a day. there's only one that I take. Only once a day and it's part of my am medication.
505.0,Provider,"that's frozen oh i'm sorry I got frozen there Jonathan is, it is the risk per dollar ones today or twice a day."
18461.0,Patient,I feel like it's probably twice a day.
505.0,Provider,I got.
18461.0,Patient,"Okay, only one pill that I only take once a day."
505.0,Provider,"That so. there's somebody who who prescribes these medications as well as the shot the injection Okay, so it looks like braveheart is not me entertaining your psych meds. So what that means is I can't reduce your medications because I don't prescribe them, however here's the thing I want you to understand, Jonathan in Vega and risperdal are very, very similar medicines. What I think they were probably you trying to do is put you on risperdal while they weren't getting the blood level of the invega up. Okay, the risk for dolla is what's making you really tight. Right, the depth but code to make you tired as well, but the risperdal a lot more tired. So what I would say to you is you're getting a shot on the 21st that's really soon. So when you go in there, I want you to say hey i'm on this shot my blood levels are high enough if they are, I want to get office risperdal. The reason it matters Jonathan is the receptor the risk bergdahl in the invega are gonna fight for the same receptors. We don't want you on both those Madison. Because they're pretty much the same met."
18461.0,Patient,Right that's what it kind of seems like when I was looking it up and they were saying they were they were it's kind of similar structure realize.
505.0,Provider,"Exactly exactly, so this is a conversation for you to have with that team that's prescribing their meds, but I want you to advocate for yourself. Okay, do you have a job, are you in school like what do you want to be doing during the day."
18461.0,Patient,"Eventually, right now, i'm gonna i'm doing this, a really big i'm just focusing on that and doing my classes, but I do eventually want a job, again I took a hiatus because of Kobe plus I needed to get my mental health correct. yep and focus on that, and you know the addiction recovery because."
505.0,Provider,that's the.
18461.0,Patient,"Most important thing to me. Because I didn't know what was going on, so I needed. Sure, a lot of help trying to get that squared away because you know, regardless or not and mental health affects how you see reality so."
505.0,Provider,"And, but john I said, you are clearly a very intelligent guy did you graduate from high school I have you had college work."
18461.0,Patient,Oh yeah I went to college.
505.0,Provider,"yeah what, what is your what is you feel."
18461.0,Patient,Real Estate commercial real estate development.
505.0,Provider,interest. diligence okay so you're a detail guy.
18461.0,Patient,yeah I went to penn the University of Pennsylvania and.
505.0,Provider,"You did that's awesome. This is awesome so. you're smart Jonathan I want you to participate in your mental health care to the highest level, you are capable of okay. You understand receptor you understand when I. say a medicine is competing for the same receptor. So that's those are the kind of things I want to talk to your team about. We want you to have quality of life, and we want you to be able to think clearly. risk for dollar is great, as far as delusions blocking delusions what have you want to think about to diligence and read contracts. I don't know how you, it would be it's gonna be hard to do that i'm risperdal. Right."
18461.0,Patient,it's hard to do anything actually.
505.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
18461.0,Patient,"This is, I don't have the energy for my mind, through it, but I just feel like i'm sleeping all the time and i'm just basically. Actually vegetative state."
505.0,Provider,"Exactly and what we needed in the hospital is now which you necessarily need now so it's we've got a dial that is the other side effects huge talked about, that is very real his weight gain i'm like since November. How much weight, have you put on."
18461.0,Patient,Probably 15 pounds.
505.0,Provider,yeah.
18461.0,Patient,And I read somewhere that that typically they did a study where they figured out that it one of the meds does that to the. Obesity hormone in certain people.
505.0,Provider,yep.
18461.0,Patient,And they gain up to more than 70% 7% I mean their baseline body weight with. Exactly taking the medication.
505.0,Provider,So it's kind of a metabolic reset it's.
18461.0,Patient,"Yes, here, if you combine them both together the fact that i'm tired all the time, plus eating all the time, plus doing nothing. Worse than being in it, you just exacerbates the effects in a. case like that glue."
505.0,Provider,Exactly so good.
18461.0,Patient,"guys for things like diabetes, which I don't want to get."
505.0,Provider,"Exactly, so I want to a few more medical questions any other medical concerns for you do, you have diabetes, do you have a high blood pressure."
18461.0,Patient,"No, but my blood pressure, does get higher than normal so i'm not on meds for it, or anything but I. don't want to be cognizant of that."
505.0,Provider,"Okay excellent how tall, you are, how much do you weigh at this time."
18461.0,Patient,"About five foot 10. And I way well when I was Okay, when I was at the facility, I was to have seven but, judging by now i'm probably like two. So to 15 or something or to set."
505.0,Provider,"Okay yeah alright gotta keep an eye on that going back to your family history, you mentioned that there's a mental health concerns in your family tell me about that."
18461.0,Patient,"Well, my mother's side of the family, I know I don't know as much about my father's side of the family, but I do know my mother's side. there's a lot of mental illness my uncle Stanley is my mother's brother. He has. he's currently in a sideboard or not award but you know that. she's had schizophrenia. Since he was around my age and gender and that is made him kind of. not able to live alone and. Unable to kind of process through those we've been taking care of him for a while. Okay, this person his sister my aunt who visited today she's diagnosed bipolar. and has been for years and been on meds for six years, my mother just got diagnosed with something I don't know what it is, could be dementia, or something but she's recently started going to nami meanings as well."
505.0,Provider,Ah it's not be awesome.
18461.0,Patient,"So it's pretty prevalent in my family that's why it took me so long to come to terms with my own. Yes, because it, you know the smarter, you are the harder it is to kind of see it for yourself because you'll be making your way out of it all the time."
505.0,Provider,"And the only one worse than mental health for people who are highly intelligent is alcohol. yep that's the one I mean it's the big book is full of it, you know it's."
18461.0,Patient,"Your problem with it with the alcohol problem. is so legal and it's so hard because you're just comparing it to other people you're not really thinking about it. Think about it in terms of when I was thinking in terms of recovery, I was just thinking it was an alcohol problem. Not a dual diagnosis type of situation, so I approached we have wrong."
505.0,Provider,mm hmm.
18461.0,Patient,"not really being a good participant, because you know, on the one hand, you have people telling you there's a problem but not telling you what it is and not being you know."
505.0,Provider,mm hmm.
18461.0,Patient,"which you know yeah their own reasons, so it goes the way it goes sometimes but yeah it was it was a rough road trying to figure out what exactly was wrong because, like you know 90% of the time you're feeling fine within the other."
505.0,Provider,"person yeah and will remember with any kind of psychosis think about when you're delusional think about your brain being on fire, I mean it like your your damage chain grey matter. We want you on medication and staying stable to preserve your functioning we don't want to be like your uncle Stanley where you are in a place where you need care right we when you are on medication, you can have a excellent quality of life. But you're going to have to work really closely with your alcohol of recovery and your treatment team for them to understand now couple of things that you probably know, but i'm going to say it anyway. Do you know, the percentage of people with schizophrenia who smoke cigarettes."
18461.0,Patient,Actually don't know that.
505.0,Provider,"look it up Jonathan it's it's about 90% it is on believable. Actually, the nicotine is hopeful with psychotic symptoms there's a reason people smoke a lot and people with schizophrenia will chain smoke two three. you've seen it."
18461.0,Patient,"yeah i've seen it, but I don't smoke."
505.0,Provider,I never want you to smoke what i'm saying is smoking would be very high risk for you so.
18461.0,Patient,"I know I know because i've actually done a couple with people that have this it's it's the same stuff. But just I was wondering whether they're always offering a smoke breaks all the time. So I did smoke during the smoke break here and there, but not nearly as much as other people, because I don't really get anything out of smoking, that I wasn't sure why it was so prevalent and why I was so encouraged, because I was like that's a lung cancer."
505.0,Provider,"Yes, it your brain is vulnerable more vulnerable to the nicotine dependence so so you really want to avoid it The other thing I want to be sure you know, and remember for ever is benzodiazepines you know what I mean and valuable to xanax. Out of him lorazepam anything that ends and Pam. These medications are processed in our brain all of us exactly like alcohol. So they hit the gabba receptor that alcohol hits these are very, very high risk medications for you. So I just want you to really know that because i'd had so many patients with alcohol use disorder, who have gotten tripped up in their recovery, not by alcohol, but because a doctor prescribed medicine like Sam X or."
18461.0,Patient,Below.
505.0,Provider,"yeah as her klonopin. Exactly so your next research project, I want you to look up benzodiazepines and alcohol. Okay."
18461.0,Patient,That sounds like a dangerous combination.
505.0,Provider,"it's dangerous people died from it, because it's basically exacerbating and they're still hitting the same receptor. But for you, I want you to be able to advocate for you in your recovery, as well as your mental illness and I want you to know some of these landmines, because most people like me most medical providers, they don't know anything about it, the addiction."
18461.0,Patient,Oh.
505.0,Provider,Right um so that will be something for you to.
18461.0,Patient,"always remember, let me write it down since."
505.0,Provider,yeah write it down.
18461.0,Patient,You said to look.
505.0,Provider,"I want you to look up i'll read it, the chat. Things like Connor pin. paintings and how much i'm sober time do you have, at this point."
18461.0,Patient,"See. that's a good question, I guess, since this definitely since Christmas so let's just say a month to be easy."
505.0,Provider,"Perfect perfect. 30 days that's great your brains healing. All right, did you get my chat."
18461.0,Patient,yeah. yeah I read it on my phone to just.
505.0,Provider,Okay excellent I think it'll be really interesting to. So kind of to close up here i'm your medications her being managed by an outside prescriber who can.
18461.0,Patient,drive it was the hospital a little bit that mean.
505.0,Provider,"Well, you you're going to have a place and getting your interaction. So my question to them would be are you going to have this ongoing while you're in sober living. Or is the plan that you're supposed to go to somebody else. You could come to break the heart, the issue is, if you are stable on an injectable in Vega I want you to have access to that because your blood levels are going to be much more stable and as a working person with goals. Having an injectable it is awesome."
18461.0,Patient,So.
505.0,Provider,So that's my question is whether you can can stay with this organization and continue to gain a shot.
18461.0,Patient,"yeah from what i've heard, I can go to any clinic and get the shot."
505.0,Provider,But I want them to know you yeah Maybe you can go to any.
18461.0,Patient,One someone that has my history.
505.0,Provider,"I want somebody who. gets it and they're going to understand your goals your life you're a young man, we don't want another 15 pounds on you and you not being able to work or a field Troy."
18461.0,Patient,"came to if I came to braid hard, then I would still just need to. Make sure I still have the injectable."
505.0,Provider,"yeah wouldn't be able to prescribe that and the next question is, can you reduce or taper off though oral risk virgo that's what's making you tired Jonathan."
18461.0,Patient,Because they're competing for the same receptor.
505.0,Provider,"They are competing for the same receptor. Unless you are actively site kotick. It seems like the if the invega dose is doing its job. it's better to have be in Vega rolling and then take away the one that's making you tired. But if you need it and it's better go to the hospital. And I guess you gotta sit on the couch. Right. All right, Jonathan well listen it's been lovely talking to you is there anything else, I can do. support you."
18461.0,Patient,"that's all I know so. Okay, I just need to make sure it's a bad who's actually prescribing because I feel like the hospital prescribed it."
505.0,Provider,"yeah but they're bringing you back in because you had to hospitalization so close together they might say, listen, we need to hold you and manage her care for the next six months because you're you're not we haven't traded your meds correctly. Okay Okay, my friend thanks for talking to me."
18461.0,Patient,Thank you for taking the time.
505.0,Provider,yeah if you have any questions he let me know.
18461.0,Patient,"Right, I will."
505.0,Provider,"Okay bye. So please make a note this patients diagnosis is our schedule, affective disorder. Severe severe this patient has had to psychiatric hospital his patients in one in November, one in December, both in the context of alcohol use disorder, he was.

He is being prescribed in Vega injectable entice correct. monthly he said he's on a loading toes right now. We have talked to his treatment plan here's an outside prescriber who's managing that I did a lot of psycho education. about his diagnosis his treatment they kind of medications that we use to manage his illness encourage him to say on meds. This patient may not be appropriate for great hurt right now he has the judgment, the insight and the capacity to participate in patient care appropriately, so we could definitely keep him at this point with the. With their dream in teams had understanding it he did compensates than telemedicine, when I be appropriate for his needs his mental status exam he is his aspect is constricted. However, he's very cooperative very pleasant good eye contact his speech is normal. His mood appears pretty dynamic he's linear his goal directed he is future oriented and there's no suicidal or homicidal. ideation there is no evidence of delusional contact at this time, no auditory or visual hallucinations are reported as tunnel evidence of responding data internal or external stimuli. Is risk assessment and that he has fused symptoms associated with risk. Other than these two psychiatric hospital is Haitians for. delusional content related to his father owning many apartments and that he was permitted to live kind of wherever he wanted to he was living or if he was in a neighbor Superman and confused protective factors his social support. He has good coping and problem solving skills and he has the ability to see connects us help he referenced his future plans, and it is. His appropriately appropriate again for outpatient entertainment his problems include a problem list obesity schizo factor this order. Care can't remember what else. Okay um so follow up care we will put him with a California provider i'm going to recommend Mary Kessler, who has experienced with severe mental illness and we'll be able to work with him on his medication if she's not comfortable with his level of acuity. I will retain this patient and work with him on his medications However, please rate can note, I do not have any mental health groups, he would have to be with a different prescriber please bill and code this at the highest level of complexity. and I care carefully note alcohol use disorder will have to have to continue to monitor. That, if this patient starts drinking again this unlikely, we would be able to stabilize his mental health and uh he should be referred to a higher level of care without delay, thank you."
