304.0,Provider,"chat with you one on one. No problem yeah and and I, I mean i'm i'm so sorry for kind of lapsing my brain lapse about our conversation about your insurance, so thank you for reminding me of that and yeah I realize it's so expensive if you have to meet meet that deductible um."
14495.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I think just even for like the the one on one sessions with you in the doctrine stuff they make me pay like 150 bucks up front. So I i'm i'm pretty limited on that right now I. am now I mean I trade stocks, and you know not as much crypto is before but. it's been kind of a rough month on that and honestly to I came off the suboxone pretty fast. I. Definitely feel like I. still need to build up my energy like i'm kind of sluggish so I you know i've been forcing myself to you know go out for walks and I play in a band, so I play you know, an instrument regularly and. You know i'm. i'm not just completely on active, but I definitely can tell that I still got some work to do."
304.0,Provider,and
14495.0,Patient,"I mean, as far as using or anything goes like I haven't really even had a thought of it because it's just not a choice."
304.0,Provider,But even an option.
14495.0,Patient,"yeah so um. But I mean things are good and i'm grateful I just I had a really great I am 35 years old and I, you know i've. I own my own House and you know i've i've always done really well and I had a really great 10 years and the last couple just between a lot of different things i've just been kind of doing some soul searching on what the next step is because i've never. really been able to be complacent with anything and I, you know I The worst thing for me to have is time on my hands. And I kind of have a more than i'd like right now. Okay i'm trying to. fill my days it's like the week goes by fast, but the days are really long."
304.0,Provider,"Right. yeah so tell me buddy like what what was going on for you, when you started using how how long were you using and."
14495.0,Patient,"few months. Just being totally honest I mean I did a good amount of drinking in my early 20s. I still have some drinks here and there, never really been you know huge on drinking never really been like huge on anything consistently i've had periods, where i've tried different things. i'm never was consistent with it other than like I said in my early 20s you know you know drinking, for the first couple years when I was 21. But um this What happened was I was taking some some xanax that a friend had gotten that's not a friend anymore, but that had fentanyl in it as well. So um. And it just it I started, you know it wasn't every day, then I started doing it every day, and then I tried stopping and then I felt the withdrawals and. Then was trying to figure out how to get help and. It came it came down to it, that you know I had to do the Inpatient detox. Okay, that was the way that I could get off. What it was so I went in to detox for a week and got put on suboxone and it's it's been a month and I am on day three without the suboxone right now."
304.0,Provider,"yeah gosh buddy yeah it's you know it's scary. it's scary when you know I mean, of course, just. Just you know, drugs and maybe all the things you know i'm i'm 36 so you may be remember. Dare and. All that stuff that we grew up. Drugs are and and and I believe that and i've seen how it wrecks. people's lives, and you know there's So even if you think it's like a xanax well you know it's prescribed, but you know the exit with things."
14495.0,Patient,"I don't get a real xanax. right was I, I have a prescription for lorazepam. And I just i've taken you know, probably a couple times a month, if I like really can't sleep and the feeling that i've had off of those was really nowhere near what these were I mean these these really. Really kind of sedated me and made definitely I noticed I started getting slower. You know, not as not as rapid on my speech and. You know, not as pretty as I normally was and i'm glad that i'm. Getting back to myself. that's why it's. Not even an option, because. It really did scare the shit out."
304.0,Provider,"yeah you didn't know what you were taking which is scary it could have been I mean fentanyl is so dangerous cocaine or. math or just just all of those, but I think, where I see you buddy just from the little bit that i've known you is like you were not deep. into like a drug. Life in like address. Some culture like you're working like you have like a functional you know, like you. You were not your development like wasn't stunted by."
14495.0,Patient,Like.
304.0,Provider,"a life of you know, doing drugs, since you are, you know 12 years old, so I and and I think the fact that you did go to Inpatient rehab is is so helpful, like, I think the fact that you just needed that you know short time."
14495.0,Patient,Maybe that why couldn't take it. anymore like I I wanted myself back.
304.0,Provider,"Exactly and maybe that saved you years of being on suboxone or years of people who like are often on you know relapse and then so. yeah I think if you've been off of it for three days like. And you feel you feel good you know I think that's understandable that you might still be feeling like a little sluggish or a little lack of energy. You know your body and your brain is still kind of trying to like. equalize everything out. But you know if you have a good support system. You know you have. You know, some income coming in, I know you had that. That situation that wasn't your fault, you know, but you have a house, you have some support you have you know just some some hobbies if. You know your mental health is stable i'm. All of those things like I i'm confident that. You know. you'll you'll be able to kind. of close this chapter."
14495.0,Patient,"yeah no I am too, and I know that you know I my body's been good to me I haven't been the best to my body and it's I feel it's still recovering. and Like I said i'm i'm in good spirits, I feel I may i'm definitely not how I was normally like if i'm not bouncing off the walls like you know pushing people around and joking around and shake and people people wonder what's wrong with me. yeah so i'm definitely. feel like i'm pretty far from where I used to be, as far as just how I i've kind of always naturally been especially like when i'm sober. Because I mean. pretty much throughout my whole life i've always you know, even if I haven't had a huge drinking problem or anything i've always gone months without drinking just because I even a couple drinks, I feel like you know it's like everything I tried to do, I always try and do it really well. i'm not a perfectionist because I know that i'll never be perfect and I don't want to be perfect, because it's like there's nothing to work for after that, like, if I were to be perfect, then there's like what's next. Right and so i'm totally fine without being that because I feel like I used to you know, be a lot more of a perfectionist and stuff but it's like. it's one thing to start you know even like guitar you know it's taken me years and years and years to play at a certain level and it's it's not about just getting to that level it's about staying there. And that's just kind of where I am with a lot of things right now, because I definitely. i'm definitely. Like I said i'm i'm not the happiest at where i'm at because I feel like I could be doing."
304.0,Provider,What do you feel like you could be doing what is it that you feel like maybe or.
14495.0,Patient,i'm sorry someone just knocked on my door I don't know.
304.0,Provider,Oh sure sure yeah no problem.
14495.0,Patient,sorry about that.
304.0,Provider,"buddy so. Maybe, is it instead of getting down on yourself about feeling like you haven't accomplished, you know everything you want to accomplish you know at only 35 years old, I mean do you do you think that it has goals and things that you still want for your life."
14495.0,Patient,"Well, I don't I wouldn't say that i'm really down on myself about it i'm. i'm like I said i'm definitely not up like I normally am and i'm yeah i'm a little down to the whole situation, because I feel a little bit lost right now. And I think it's just because to i'm. trying to get back to normal and i'm glad that you know it, one thing that really also made me want to go get help is because my guitar playing started. fading and I really couldn't even use my hands like I used to so you know i've got my hands back and i've been practicing a lot so there's a lot of things that i've made progress on and i'm glad I went and got help and. glad that I am moving forward, but like I said it's this is new to me as far as like having a struggle."
304.0,Provider,So.
14495.0,Patient,You know it's everything's there nothing's really ever been a problem in anything that's ever was I fixed it. And this is something that you know I believe I have fixed it but it's it's new to me too. So exactly.
304.0,Provider,"yeah, so I think you have that confidence in yourself that like i've been through hard things before and I I can do this, like I i've been through problems before and like you have those skills, you have that problem solving skill sets to ask for help, like you knew. You couldn't stop on your own and like you. got help, and so, if if you start to have cravings if you start to have temptations again in the future, like you know what to do. You know, to avoid those people to avoid that temptation, you know call Brian hurt again call the rehab again go to a. You know, smart recovery. You know, get some support talk to a. All of those skills that you. What what kind of support, do you have buddy as far as like family, friends, that you can count on."
14495.0,Patient,"ya know i've i've got a lot of friends and I mean. Not not too much family left, but you know I i've got my mom and. We got a couple sisters and it's I don't know this is kind of one of the one times that i've asked for help, to which i've kind of just learning that it's okay to ask for help. As i've always done everything you know by myself, because, like I said i've never really ran into a situation like like that, where I you know tend to do this so it's now been different, but i've always been the black sheep out of my friends or family so as as far as as far as you know. Any drug use or you're drinking or whatever, I would say I was probably always the worst one if you know, not to say that it was terrible, but you know, are the people that are around me, you know they've never screwed around with any of that stuff. Okay, so it's. You know it's it's good that there was only one person I knew that you know even had these."
304.0,Provider,guys okay. So is your you feel like you're the black sheep of your family and your friend group just because of what you're going through now.
14495.0,Patient,"More so just using it as an example to say like that in my support group that I have I would be I would be the worst one of them. You know so it's like. Everyone that's around us is is a good influence. Okay, as far as your. Was I didn't mean like that, as a whole, because you know i've i've gone to college and graduated and i've always gotten good grades and. You know so i've always done really well but as far as you know, doing crazy things are you know you know or how I you know, like I said, you know some drinking when I was in my early 20s or the drugs that I have experienced with you know i've. You know, then. But been the most you know. done the most out of any of my my friends or family like I said, not to say like it's been really bad, but compared to them like I said, everyone else you know."
304.0,Provider,"I see. Okay, so they're. they're keeping you on this they're gonna keep you on the straight and narrow and."
14495.0,Patient,"yeah I know, and when I started to be like you know when I needed help you know it was they were popping in on me all the time. And they would like they were you know, showing up at my house and I, you know I think they. Once once I admitted, you know what was going on, because I took a drug test and like tested the pills. was how I knew it had fentanyl in it, because, like I said I was."
304.0,Provider,Trying.
14495.0,Patient,I tried weaning off with my lorazepam because I thought I was just hooked on bezos. Right yeah. And I was withdrawing like crazy.
304.0,Provider,"So, my goodness, and so buddy the lorazepam that you have is is prescribed. yeah yeah."
14495.0,Patient,yeah like I said I I haven't even been taking it. At all um. I have it. And it's it's something that i've never really taken every day.
304.0,Provider,"And you know and doctors, people say the same thing you know if you're someone who like didn't have a huge problem with alcohol and you want to go have a beer, with a friend on a Friday night. Or you know watch a game, you know that's fine your your. It doesn't sound like that was addictive to you if you are really struggling with you know you got to go get a dental procedure and you're super anxious about it and. They prescribe you a lorazepam or you're having a really hard night and you just can't sleep and you take one here and there. You know that's that's what it's indicated, for you know benzodiazepines are are dangerous if you chronically. Use them and they have that potential for. But it sounds like you. You know that and you're very conscious of it and you're conscious of how you take it. You know just if you're really struggling you know of course not mixing the alcohol are very dangerous, so I think, as long as like you just really educate yourself and you're very self aware. If you're really I just would want you to leave this being like aware of your feelings like if you're feeling a little bit anxious, but you could go for a walk you could call a friend, you could watch a movie. You could you know, take a hot shower all try try all those things first. You know if you find yourself wanting to to drink or shop or or you know. Take lorazepam whatever it is, you know try some other things first. Talk to somebody write it out, you know, whenever it is before you. go down the path of any substance, you know and that's any substance right even prescribed substances even. Alcohol even marijuana you know. Obviously opiates you know but, but any. Any substance i'm. Telling yourself like. Well, why do I think that I need this, what do I think it's gonna do for me and kind of just thinking it through before you, you act yeah that makes."
14495.0,Patient,"One you know I did I did learn a lot in the week that I was in the in rehab. It seemed like I had come in on like a like. Last week of like there was a lot of people that were there for like a month. It seemed like the week that I was there was they were kind of putting all the mindfulness and and everything kind of together and. You know my mom's been a nurse for like 50 years, so you know she's kind of always beat this stuff into my head too. So there was a lot. That that I kind of already you know I knew about, but I never really put to. Put the practice. You know, so I have been you know, trying to meditate and breathe and and and stop in and. You know, really try and I guess one one of my faults has always been you know things that I that I can't control that i've always tried to change. So I really have taken a step back i'm. trying to figure out, if I can change it or not, I guess that's the. hardest is that."
304.0,Provider,"In the rehab you probably heard the serenity prayer. yeah it's true control and, yes, especially other people right we can't. yeah."
14495.0,Patient,"yeah well, I mean, even with boundaries and everything to you know I I. guess there's a part of me that's been. You know i've always been really good to my friends and family, and you know I guess part of me is is a people pleaser too and i've really been. feeding it into my head that you know I I can't understand how someone else feels other than myself if if I do if I am on this. stage with something that's. Why, I have the friends that I have and that. You know everyone's got their boundaries and I, you know i'm only responsible for feeling the way about mine and. And that it's my duty to disappoint as many people as possible by keeping my boundaries."
304.0,Provider,I love that I love that it's it's your duty it's your obligation to yourself. don't don't disappoint yourself if you disappoint anybody else except yourself you're the one person you shouldn't disappoint. yeah yeah.
14495.0,Patient,"that's that's what i'm working on like I said I feel like. For all the things that i've gone through in life and everything it's it's been smooth sailing, no matter what because i've figured it out without really even thinking about it just. With actions and always kind of knowing what to do, and like I said I think i'm just. just going through something new right now and i'm also you know kind of doing some soul searching because. that's you know, in a band that I play and I I do all the work like i've always done all the promotions all the merchandise, all the booking you know everything in it, it kind of war on me for a while and that was kind of. Also, what started, I think. Some of like maybe a little depression and some of the using is that. Like i've always doing everything myself, and you know it's like. trying to get just you know people that are around me, no matter what i'm doing just to you know pick up some slack. And I love playing music so much that it's you know we were playing every weekend and with colgan and everything else it's just been. kind of like the dream started kind of dying and it's kind of left me like Okay, what do I do."
304.0,Provider,"Right i'm sorry i'm just trying to put this on my. out she's fine. i'm so sorry buddy you know and that's where your boundaries come in, where. You know you love it and it's something you enjoy but. But you can't do everything um. You know you can't take on everything."
14495.0,Patient,"Well, I can prove that I. had an eye on, and I even I even felt like that. i'd rather do everything, because I loved it so much, then you know not do it all, but I got I did get burnt out on it."
304.0,Provider,You got right now sure.
14495.0,Patient,"You know. So I and that's why we're not. Playing as much right now, because i'm not booking and i'm not you know. doing everything that I used to do. And I don't know if that's hurting me more or not. Because that's The other thing too is that. quit trading stocks in the morning and then you know getting my guitar practice in and then practice a couple nights a week and then playing on the weekends, you know I had a pretty full schedule. and And not only that, but you know a lot more drive to be better every week. yeah which has to show."
304.0,Provider,"yeah I mean, which is not a bad that's."
14495.0,Patient,"Why i'm saying you know now it's it's like because i've got this time and i'm not and i'm trying to take the time and be like Okay, I need to heal and I need to. You know, this is all part of it, but. it's just kind of you know. Like I said I definitely wish I was busier."
304.0,Provider,"Okay, wait you're busier okay yeah but. I guess just balance buddy like."
14495.0,Patient,Just maintaining that that balance.
304.0,Provider,"You know everything has to be in balance, like. I think you heard someone say working in."
14495.0,Patient,breaking up right away.
304.0,Provider,"Oh. i'm sorry, so it sounds like you know your work is also something. That you enjoy and it's a hobby to you. But yeah like just keeping that balance of making time for social making time for self care, making time for taking care of yourself physically getting enough rest, you know just just trying to keep all those pieces of the of the pie equal where there's not you know 90% of it is worker."
14495.0,Patient,"Well that's that's what that's what i'm trying to do is keep my wheel of spiritual occupational. You know, and you know all that stuff as true, as I possibly can, and I feel like I I have decent balance right now but. Like I said, no matter what I don't feel like i'm at a high point of my life by any means, and you know, no matter what it's just kind of hard to deal with and i'm dealing with it and I, you know realize what's going on around me and i'm just working at it."
304.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14495.0,Patient,It it just is what it is i'm just you know being honest about it.
304.0,Provider,"yeah yeah I hear that so. um. yeah I mean it's just kind of. yeah you know all of this stuff I think Thank you have a really good foundation and. Even and i'd be more than a foundation. But it's it's. putting it into practice it's the. living at day to day that. Is the tricky part. I think you. You have some good support around you, you have some good skills. And you know yeah reach out for help again if you need it. yeah I think this could just be a chapter of your life that you've learned from and then you just move forward yeah."
14495.0,Patient,"Well, I guess that's what i'm doing i'm just. You know I know. What it takes for me to be happy, and you know I i'm trying to like I said, be grateful for everything that I have. But i'm just not as happy as I used to be, then I. You know I have every everything was has always been really great for me so it's you know it's something new that i'm dealing with right now and. part of its just the way that I feel and i'm just acknowledging my feelings and letting myself feel the way I feel because i'm not going to fight it."
304.0,Provider,Exactly.
14495.0,Patient,"And i'm like I said I don't feel like i'm depressed or anything like that, but i'm just you know I got work to do."
304.0,Provider,And and it's okay buddy like you can be both right like you can be grateful. For everything you have but.
14495.0,Patient,and
304.0,Provider,"You can be grateful, and you can feel like you know something's missing or you can be grateful and acknowledge that you're just not quite happy with where you are."
14495.0,Patient,"By using green. Are you still on walk down the street and really just soak everything in and it's like I live off off the fox river and carry you know so everything's you know really nice around me. And it's like i'm looking at it on I look at it i'm like yeah it's beautiful night, but I really don't fucking care. Like it's like I I don't. You know right when I got out of rehab I really appreciated it because i've never been locked down like that, before. What I you know even yesterday I forced myself to go, for you know, a couple mile walk. In the whole walk i'm just like thinking about shit and i'm like I can't I just walk and look around and soak everything in. And I think that's why I know my body's still as healing to do because you know those drugs for me up."
304.0,Provider,"and be patient with yourself to and be gentle and kind to yourself to. You know that it's amazing that you went out for a walk and and you meet your psyche needed to think through those things you know. and not get down or. You know beat yourself up. So that's part of the mindfulness to. is like that radical non judgmental acceptance of just what where you are what you're feeling what you're thinking. And then use those mindfulness skills to you know, because no one can be mindful every second of every day, no one can be totally present every second of every day but take those small moments to. You know, take those those opportunities when you can to practice, you know, two minutes of mindfulness five minutes of mindfulness. And if your mind starts to wander you get distracted. You know you just come back to it. yeah yeah you're not perfect, nobody is so."
14495.0,Patient,"yeah like I said i'm. I feel like I kind of you know I know what's going on, and I know you know that I just have to keep working at it and that. everything in life is temporary even problems so."
304.0,Provider,"yeah exactly yeah well i'm so glad we got to meet buddy yeah i'm so excited to kind of. You know just see where you're going to go from here, I know we we might not see it but. yeah I think you're gonna you know give yourself just a little bit of time a little bit of patience, a little bit of gentleness with yourself to kind of yeah let your body and your brain really you know reset. But. You know it wasn't easy, but I think you're gonna. you're just going to get better."
14495.0,Patient,"yeah i'm hoping. I feel I feel pretty confident about it, you know i'm i'm going to go for another walk right we're done with this call and. As much as you know, I don't really feel up to doing it i'm going to force myself to go walk a couple miles, I mean I I. I can't stand staying inside and it's like I the first couple of weeks, it was kind of Okay, because i'm not normally used to doing that. But you know there's a part of me that's you know kind of starting to go kind of nuts from being inside so much."
304.0,Provider,"Yes, get out i'd be fall, is the best time of year I think so get outside while you can yeah and all any any of that physical release buddy I mean it's. Just everybody says it all the time, but. I mean it's true."
14495.0,Patient,"Well, I think. just getting off the suboxone it's everything's running through me right now, and I can tell that my body's just not right, right now, you know it's. it's i'm not feeling like chest pain, or like anxiousness or restless legs or anything like that, but it's just everything's not agreeing with me and I, you know i've heard that you know it's all part of the side effects or whatever getting off of it but. So i'm just hoping that my digestive system and everything else starts to go back to normal. yeah to. Last like probably a week and a half. It just hasn't been right it's like why I drink a lot of fluids it like goes like straight to my stomach and it's just like sitting in there."
304.0,Provider,"yeah. sorry to hear that yeah, but I think. yeah I think it just takes a little time, you know. Some of the other. Side effects that people experience a lot. With suboxone like especially like. constipation like you. Know you'll you'll have freedom from those you know negative side effects of suboxone too so. yeah yeah hopefully just. yeah give it a little time and. You know yeah get enough rest. You know eat nutritiously yeah keep doing your walk solid that."
14495.0,Patient,"The I know i've lost 20 pounds, since I got out of rehab but i'm still like. 30 pounds over what I normally am so. i've got a lot still got a lot of work to do."
304.0,Provider,"yeah Oh, but I mean that's amazing to already have that. So. You know."
14495.0,Patient,yeah I think I probably had 10 pounds of water in my legs.
304.0,Provider,Oh wow.
14495.0,Patient,"yeah I think the effect or whatever was in those was what because my my legs went back to normal in like four or five days, all of a sudden, they got super skinny. So I can tell that I definitely had some some fluid in my legs from it too. i'm glad to at least see that my legs went back to normal and my kidney function and. All that is okay so."
304.0,Provider,"Yes, Oh well, buddy i'm just i'm so happy for you that you got help before it it got worse because, ultimately, that would really be the only place it would go would be worse. Just deeper and deeper into an addiction and. Having a harder and harder and time and longer and longer that you'd have to be on suboxone. For. You mental emotional physical for burning your your whole life that's that's what. A lot so it's wonderful it's it's refreshing it's good to see people who recognized early on that. You know this was a problem and then you've got out for it. got worse so."
14495.0,Patient,yeah i'm. grateful for that.
304.0,Provider,"yeah well take care of yourself buddy yeah if you know if you need anything in the future, as far as just support or resources yeah feel free to email me. Dr holds for knows a lot of like the local. resources to around kind of the Northwest suburbs so yeah he's knowledgeable about kind of resources and people too, so yeah please, please reach out to us if."
14495.0,Patient,"If there's anything yeah no I i'm. as of right now i'm planning on staying in contact until I know i'm through this too, so you know if. If if a month goes by and everything's a lot better than that you know i'll probably just you know be okay, but for right now i'm kind of keeping it in the back of my mind that i'm you know i've got a check in and a month, just so I don't just so I know that I have to hold some accountability."
304.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, so do you want to we want um. yeah we'll just kind of leave everything as far as like you're right her, and then you want to just check in. With group in about a month, and let us know how you're doing."
14495.0,Patient,"yeah i'll i'll message message you and the doctor. Depending on how the next couple weeks ago, you know as long as I can continue to keep moving forward and see progress and not not have urges. You know, like I said I don't know how it's going to go, I know that I know that it's it should go fine and i'm confident with that, but i'm i'm not just going to say that i'm 100% you know fixed from all this too. Because I know that's like it's. it's cause some damage and I accept that. And you know, thankfully, it didn't cause any personal relationship issues or anything like that you know I didn't freak out on any one or abuse anyone or anything like that you know more so affected me than anything. But I like I said i'm just. just making sure that I get through those before. I think that it's taking care of."
