726.0,Provider,Virginia working. with you.
13730.0,Patient,"Let me think. I haven't had much anxiety just a little here and there, and it's still a mystery like when it happens i'm like I don't know why i'm anxious, all of a sudden. it's not usually something I can pinpoint."
726.0,Provider,what's the level of. on a scale of one to 10 How would you rate it compared to before let's say your highest feelings of anxiety.
13730.0,Patient,"um well, I guess, if we're going to put my highest at 10. I mean I don't know where else, to put it. I guess maybe there's not. um I would say we're down at three and four."
726.0,Provider,All right.
13730.0,Patient,"So sometimes I try to figure out Okay, what is this what do I need to think about and other times I just think I don't know what this is, I I try to just push it off. Okay, I don't always have time. And it's not always time to do that, but work sometimes you have a moment you can say all right i'm going to tackle this and other times i'm just like have time for this. Forget to deal with this other time."
726.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
13730.0,Patient,"So yeah it's not really I don't feel like it's interfering a lot with them. Well it's interferes in me getting i'm not as productive when I get anxious I tend to choose activities that are more distraction and less productive. So it makes me less productive person. Okay, but I don't feel like it's. Like what's gonna say I don't feel like it's interfering in relationships I don't know if that's true or not. i'm not sure."
726.0,Provider,When you say that you're feeling not as productive and more like you want to distract yourself on. yeah so you know what would you consider being a productive day as opposed to a day of distraction.
13730.0,Patient,"Well, right now, i'm in a weird weird place in my life, where i'm have a job, but it's very minimal I don't work as many hours as I would like to be working and i'm okay financially i'm fine. But I won't be down the road I have right now I live on alimony. Which doesn't feel very good I don't like that feeling I would rather be. Earning my own money. yeah so I finally got a part time job which i'm glad that I have. But I know that the alimony has a date where it's going to rent out it's about two years from now it's I won't have it anymore. So in my mind i'm trying trying to plan i'm trying to say all right, we have to get established, we have to get a full time job with benefits, etc. However right now i'm kind of sitting comfortably and making that transition is hard so for me productive is really staying on top of trying to do things to get my credit score up because my finances were in shambles from my divorce. Trying to. find a job that meet you know that meets those. Standards for me just trying to establish financial independence and stability. In some ways, I have it, but I don't have i'm. Like i'm in sort of this limbo situation, and so, for me, productive means I spend a significant amount of time working toward the things that will, to some degree, free me from a situation I don't like. And sometimes i'll go too long and i'll think I should have called this in this potential employer, I should have called them, and I should have called them but I didn't do it because that that day I didn't feel. If I don't if i'm not feeling great or if I feel anxious, then I don't have the confidence to make that call."
726.0,Provider,And I really struggled with that.
13730.0,Patient,"So i'll end up. I don't know it's not that it's unproductive I don't tend to sit around and watch TV too much, but I think it's hard to know like how much, am I supposed to do, every day what's the rule there's no rule. hmm but I guess I feel like until I have accomplished a certain set of things I feel like i'm not allowed to stop kind of. You know until I have the full time job with benefits until I have a different living like i'd like to get a different apartment than the one I have now until I have a certain set of things done, then I feel like I have to. spend a certain amount of time or energy and I don't know how much i'm running into like, for instance with resumes. I thought it was a simple thing to write a resume and i'm finding now that there's all this software out there, that your resume goes through, and if your resume didn't have certain phrases in it the software just kicks it out and your resume to. One someone's desk so now I got paid i've paid for one company to review my resume and give me tips and I paid for another company to. help me write one with certain phrases in it i'm like how much do I pay for a resume i've spent quite a bit of money, I spent 50 bucks at least. And i'm still not getting any calls and you know i'm turning in my resume and i'm thinking, why would you not call me I see like a really good hire. yeah and and so that every time I. So I have a lot of stuff like that that just makes me feel anxious I think wire Why is no one calling me does no one want to hire me I keep hearing all these comments about how many jobs there are and i'm thinking okay. Then why don't they, why are they call me is. It the Ai resume is that I don't know i've never worked really hard on my resume. And it should be good. But i'm not still not getting the calls so i'm in this position, where I feel like I can't stop because, if I stop then maybe I didn't do enough, and maybe that's why I didn't get the call."
726.0,Provider,"Oh, I see."
13730.0,Patient,"And I, and I don't know how to judge, I have no way of knowing. If anyone ever saw my resume didn't even go across desks I don't know. I do occasionally get an email that will say. We got your resume we're moving forward with somebody else and i'm glad I haven't had those lately, because those at least tell me it went somewhere. yeah so yeah I feel like I have this job that is never done kind of like trying to do laundry you know it's never done. Well i'm trying to find a job. And a different living situation and a few other little things i'm trying to tweak and it's never done because I haven't gotten it yet and so. When I say unproductive I think it just makes me feel bad if I look back on my week and I didn't log significant time toward that and I don't know how much time to spend on each thing like in front of me right here is, this is my daughter's old cell phone. yeah we made a mistake, she swapped out her fun. And she made a mistake it's hard to explain, but when she slipped out the phone she thought she was getting a free new phone and she should have been. They logged it as. They were charging her for the phone and started charging a monthly fee so i've been on the. phone with them for. Probably three hours now i've been on the phone with at amp T and they finally said, we can do nothing else and they've turned me over to the company that handles phone exchanges and now, after I talk to you, I have to get on the phone with them. and see if they'll give me a $700 refund or what we're going to do. it's exhausting it's absolutely exhausting. And i'm so tired i'm just about to say you know what fine i'll pay 20 bucks a month for however long it takes for a 700 i'm about to give up and say is this worth it, and honestly if I do i'm not going to beat myself up its 20 bucks a month it's not enough to like cry my eyes out about."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
13730.0,Patient,"yeah it's just unfair, because it should have been zero. So I feel like I have lots of stuff like that I have these post, it notes everywhere i've got to deal with this got to deal with that. And just actually just talking about I feel like i'm gonna cry you can really stressed so. yeah yeah I just um."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
13730.0,Patient,"So, I guess, I do have anxiety because I have so many plates that i'm spinning kind of. yeah and. I tried to just say, well, you did a little something move on like."
726.0,Provider,After the weekend and i'll have i'll have all these emails.
13730.0,Patient,From glassdoor and I always delete them all.
726.0,Provider,I start fresh on Monday.
13730.0,Patient,"I just say whatever glassdoor sent me before we're not dealing with it, we will look on Monday we'll start over. Because like you know you could go down a rabbit hole and never come out. yeah, and so I have to just say I am limited in how much time and energy, I can put toward it, but so far, nothing is happening. So I feel. All I can think is well if nothing's happening, then I am doing something wrong or i'm not doing enough. I really the only answer I can come up with."
726.0,Provider,"sounds like, though, like it's one it's overwhelming. Even though, even if, even if. And I understand what you're saying like it's it's like these little things that built up in the list that feel really overwhelming. When you're thinking about. Like where where it is that you would want to be right. To me it sounds like you're doing. Everything possible right. For my then i'm thinking about why are you why are you internalizing that as something being like a lack of character from yourself, because it doesn't sound like that, I mean it's it sounds like you're really doing everything possible to i'm. kind of like everything."
13730.0,Patient,"A lot of times it's just lack of information and lack of experience, like I don't like I don't know how to negotiate with at amp T i'm learning as I go and i'm pushing harder and harder to get them to listen to me, and if I tend to be very kind of. gentle in my approach, and it was a big deal for me to say, I need you to translate for me to somewhere someone else because this isn't fair and you need to cover this this was handled badly and to keep saying that and keep doing that is a big stretch for me. You know, to argue with the people on the phone and be insistent and press them that's big for me. um, and so I feel like a total was that today i'm considering just dealing with it and just saying well, well, we made a mistake it's a $700 mistake that's a very big mistake. And I can trace it back and see exactly what went wrong and how. my daughter. Basically, this is something at amp T should have covered and. They won't so. I just. figure out what to do next."
726.0,Provider,"You know, maybe even sounds like maybe taking a break from a going back to what the next day. It sounds it sounds like one if you're on the phone for three hours with a company that is frustrating and so and. Before before you started having a reaction to the to that list that you were talking about you were talking about the resume and is it good and i'm posting things and i'm not hearing back some time so. Right, I wonder if it's just maybe you need some time out and they get back on on it, maybe tomorrow, maybe later later tonight."
13730.0,Patient,"Probably yeah I actually I think i'm feeling bad because I last time I dealt with it was like last Thursday or Friday and I haven't touched it since then, and so now i'm thinking Oh, maybe I waited too long. And so now it's kind of haunting me. So I haven't actually the. phone thing was last week. And they were supposed to send me. They said within an hour the email would be there and I would have a mailing label to mail the phone back and never came. You know, once again i'm like to have to start over again, I think I do I think i'm gonna have to call them again and start over because they didn't send what they said they would send again. Now, I think it actually might make me feel better I don't know if it'll be it'll really matter in the Grand scheme of things, but I do plan to tell them if you don't fix this, you will lose my business, and I will leave at amp T. And I think that might make me feel better. Just to sit because there's there's other phone companies out there, I don't need it doesn't need to be down. It might make me feel a lot better to just say. i'm going to tmobile so."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
13730.0,Patient,"I don't know it's not like I don't know if they will care, I like to think they will, but I don't think they will. And if it was and I don't know. I mean I plan to tell them that and just say. you're losing a customer, but I don't know how much they care about losing a customer I don't know."
726.0,Provider,"yeah and you never know I think of companies, a company at the end of the day, they're going to want to be able to make money. And so I think that you could even put it as a play and say it, and just see what happens because sometimes they'll they'll go above and beyond just to keep a client in there. there's a strong. try and make mistakes $700 is not. Money it's not it's not like 10 bucks you know so. I get it yeah."
13730.0,Patient,"yeah it's a mistake that basically she she said, is my phone paid off, and I said yep your phone just got paid off. If you want to switch it for another one, you may and so she decided to get online and do it herself and she was so proud, well, it turns out, I was wrong her phone wasn't paying it off, there was a $16 fee that that was left that hadn't been paid for her phone I didn't realize this. So when she made her phone swap thinking that she was doing the free swap the computer just at some point when I. Just $16 so it switched her from free phone swap to leveling up to the next phone plan which is $700. They didn't tell her this. They didn't tell me this they just started charging me and it took me a couple months to realize what had happened. And I called them and I said, this is a $16 mistake plus I don't know how your computer works there's no way I could have known that that would cause that. This is not a $700 mistake. You know, so today, I was just gonna say fine i'll send the phone back. I want my money back the money that's been charged so far we'll start from scratch, again I don't know what they'll say it's been three months now. yeah. it's just the stupidest thing. it's so stupid, but um. I can't. yeah they keep acting like well what 18 T kept saying there's nothing we can do, because we work with this other company, so now, I have the number of the other companies so i'm going to start from. scratch with them today. and say okay well here's what happened so maybe I should just assume the best maybe that's better, I have a bad habit of assuming the worst and you said something to me once you said. But what if it turns out the best you didn't say it that way, whatever situation, I was worried about. It was specific You said something along the lines of But what if, and I found that it was a better emotional investment to assume the best because, if something goes wrong there's time to be upset. But I didn't spend. All of the lead up time also being upset."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
13730.0,Patient,"Which is a complete waste it's like my mother's gonna die Should I be upset for the next 10 years or 20 years or however long my mother list, no."
726.0,Provider,That would be a waste of.
13730.0,Patient,"Time. When my mother Nice, I will be upset and I will grieve but I will agree, for 20 years or whatever. i've been thinking lately that. expecting the best. might be it just kind of like an investment a healthy investment."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
13730.0,Patient,"So maybe I should assume that this company is going to do the best for me and then, if they don't I can be sad I didn't know i've wasted like a week being sad and upset about it already."
726.0,Provider,"So. Think of it this way to Virginia it's like like the the really the feelings that are coming up it's it's it was frustrating to deal with a cell phone company when you're talking about a big mistake like that right that it's from there, and he wasn't on your side right."
13730.0,Patient,So now.
726.0,Provider,"i'm that i'm you know thinking about it's like that's fixable like that is not something that is unfixable can never be repair. And so, the important thing is to say, to yourself it's like, how can I get to a better feeling place because when I feel better I feel like I can do better, or it feels. easier to do things when you feel good so it's like. So alright, so we identified you feel overwhelmed. Right and you feel like oh my goddess I have all this stuff going on, so. taking the time to think of like what what would help me feel better in this situation when i'm starting to steer big and it's okay like acknowledging the fact that you feel overwhelmed let yourself feel. The feeling because we don't want to deny the feeling right we don't want to push it away or minimize it it's there and now once you get into that and then you think. Oh, let me breathe i'm going to breathe into this Okay, how can I shift this feeling, how can I shift this feeling of being overwhelmed. So it could be you, you went out for a walk it could be, it could be so many different things it just depends on what you would want to do, and then after your brain gets a break from that you come back to it like. Okay, I can do this, I can get back to it."
13730.0,Patient,"yeah, I think, more than anything, i'm anxious to get it over with it because I figure they'll either give me what I want or they won't and if they don't, then I can take a breath and go okay Well, this is your situation now let's move on. Maybe it's the not knowing that's driving me crazy because, even if they say no. I can, I can handle it, I mean it's not going to break me financially I just don't like it. I don't want to sit around being angry with that. that's yeah that's that bitterness is eating the APP, and so I need to do my best, and then I feel like I need to move on from it. And just say, well, if I need to leave a team to will or which I don't really want to, and if they don't like I don't know but it'll hurt them. So it might be a stupid, you know that phrase cutting off your nose to spite your face I don't wanna do that. yeah so I just want to do my best, and just add, if I have to if i'm stuck paying $20 a month for a phone that I don't really want. it's not a giant amount of money. it's not my favorite thing but. it's probably not enough money for me to get bent out of shape over. yeah and another year on my daughter can start paying it herself, because she will be finished with school and i'll be like um you're paying these $20 fee."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
13730.0,Patient,"I probably should just let her know give her a date and say starting here, this is yours. yeah and um we can do that, I think."
726.0,Provider,"Also, identifying you know how you were saying it's feeling overwhelmed. yeah also is it feeling like you don't have control over the situation because you also I always like to think of its own sometimes it's harder to sit and wait for something. But when you're doing everything possible and it's easier when you're out there just doing whatever it is that you. want to do so, I don't know if maybe part of that frustration that you're feeling or that overwhelming is just because it's kind of like i'm a sitting duck it's like you're like."
13730.0,Patient,"I have no control over my my. Anything right now. And in the silly part is I really am in a good situation, I have a great big Gala and he check that covers all my needs right now."
726.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
13730.0,Patient,"I just know I think i'm just really scared I don't want to depend on that because it is not permanent. I have a couple more years and then it's going to go away yeah. And I think on I don't think about it often but I often be rate myself for spending a year year and a half. Not doing much with it, I got I got divorced, and then coven hit, like all the same time. wow right when I moved I moved out. And then there was quarantine everything was crazy so getting a job was really hard and at some point, I had the bright idea that I will i'll go to school instead i'll go to school, while I have my alimony and then i'll be more qualified for a job at the end of it. And it felt really comforting because I didn't have to look for a job which was overwhelming. I went to school for a year wasn't happy with it. So I quit and I was like i'm not doing that. yeah so now I I think I have some regrets, I think I think Why did I not get a job right away. But I didn't Why did I wait and so now it's coming closer and closer to the end and. yeah I think i'm scared i'm scared of being left feeling stupid and I feel I feel a little embarrassed and lazy and the truth is, I was kind of a mess emotionally I probably needed to just have a break. I spent like six months, like laying in bed and watching me yeah. And, but i'm not proud of that, and so now, even though it doesn't make sense, I feel, like all of that. is why I can't find a job now, which makes no sense. Because my employers don't know that I was eating potato chips for six months they don't know that. yeah and I quit school, but they don't know that I still have a bachelor's degree. I didn't need more school. I don't think I mean or do I does anyone ever know. How much schooling is enough, I finally decided, I was not going to pursue more because I was miserable and I hated it. yeah so. yeah so I decided to extra schooling wasn't for me, but I did spend a year study. which at the time, felt like a good investment, but now that I decided i'm not going to get the degree does not feel like a good investment now, it feels like a waste of time, thank goodness it's not much of a waste of money, because most of it was free. But. I think I feel like this icky shame like I spent all this time not working wasted time studying and then quit quit the program now I can't get a job and and somehow I think i'm equating that with well when you did this. You did these negative things. So now you can't get a job and I realized that's not real, but I think that might kind of be there in my head."
726.0,Provider,"I wonder if you could create them a narrative in your mind like Oh, you know, but you were going through a hard time. And yeah. You need a time for yourself that's that's it's right after the worst it's a huge it's a huge transition transition."
13730.0,Patient,"It was huge yeah. yeah for 26 years it was, and I was a stay at home mom so big transition and I realized there's nothing wrong with going to school and then deciding I don't actually want to do this that's okay to do it. It does not so moving, but I. come from a very academic family. So it was really hard to tell my family that I quit school that was. really hard. And and. To my family it's all about the education and um I kind of feel differently, I would almost rather have a job that doesn't really require a lot of education, where I can just do my job. And then come home and not think about my work. Who knows, I don't know but uh but yeah I come from an academic background and so quitting going to school for a year and then quitting is a kind of a source of shame. When you come from an academic. Family like my parents are college professors, and so I kind of feel like a failure and I don't want to accept that because I don't think I failed, I think I just was like when, in fact. it's such a source of pride to me that I had a 4.0 when I quit which is silly because no one will ever care know or care what my GPA was since I don't have a degree, I don't have it, I don't have anything. But. It was kind of a source of pride for me that I had to have this beautiful. grade I don't know, I guess, I just want to say i'm not a failure. yeah I had all a's I chose to quit I didn't fail. But yeah I think I feel like a. Failure I just didn't know what I wanted I I hadn't been in the workforce for so long, so I got this idea that I was going to do this, one thing and then I was like I hate this I don't want to do this. I don't know how I was supposed to know if I didn't try. So now, I have. I don't know the situation where I feel like i've wasted a year and a half. And now i'm watching the looming deadline of of my alimony payments coming to an end. And i'm wanting to get secure employment and feel good about it. And I feel like when I complain I sound like this privileged woman oh poor me i've only bills are paid by someone else. But I don't really want that I want to be able to pay my own bills I don't like having money from my ex husband that's feels really gross to me I don't like it. it's the way it is, but I don't like it."
726.0,Provider,"Virginia, when you say that that the mental conversations that are happening in your mind like if you were to track the voices of who's actually making those judgments, is it really you or is it i'm like. When you would expect your your mom or your dad to say and that's and it's getting internalized as."
13730.0,Patient,"it's probably. In many ways, it's my mom and dad not entirely I it it's partially them and it's interesting because, in my mind I have different criticisms from different people groups. i've gotten the academic family. who honestly. I tell myself I don't care what they think and I try not to give them that much information about my life, these days, but there's that inner child that just still wants to please them all the time and then there's friends, I have now in the place where I live, now, can I feel like. I look like this. I think I feel I feel real shame, about the fact that I have a lot of privilege, I feel a lot of shame about it. yeah, and so I feel like i'm not allowed to complain like Why would you complain. Look what you have and I get that. But it doesn't make me happy. I really want to earn their own way. And i'm terrified to do it, and you know my ex husband he could always make money, no matter what. If I mean he would get us into terrible financial trouble, but he could always get another job and he could always find money he was very, very good at that. And i'm so here, I am the money he sends every month, is what I live on, and I can't seem to find anything and that's frustrating It makes me feel like he's still controls me. he's still the one where everything goes is rosy he he's always got a new job he's always got something and then he sends me money and I live off of his success and I don't want to live off his success, I want to live off. And I feel like I gave up. All these years, where I could have been building, you know a great big beautiful resume work experience more degrees. And I didn't do that I stayed at home with my children, which does not provide for a beautiful resume at all improvised very, very empty. there's not a lot on there, and so. I think I might just be grieving the fact that. I gave up so much and now i'm in this be holding position this privileged position that's not going to last. And i'm like who am I what am I even doing. So right now I work as a crossing guard. For school. But it's my job and I like doing it, but. You know. It doesn't pay the bills. No ain't nobody could pay the bills on that and. there's a part of me that really likes having a blue collar job, though I know that might sound weird."
726.0,Provider,And I don't always know.
13730.0,Patient,"I don't always throw words like blue collar white collar around I know you're a therapist so I figure I can throw those words around it it's okay i'm i'm like the most white collar woman that ever was, and I think I really enjoy the fact that. I were like reflective clothes, have a big. sign and whistle. I think I like having a blue collar job because I feel like i'm doing the real work, why it sounds silly, but I think I. I think I really like that. And so I think part of me wants to get a job. That doesn't require a lot of education, because he just. I know from growing up with my parents half the time you take those jobs home with you very hard to shuffle. And that's I grew up with that and I watched my husband do it, and so there's a part of me that's like, can I just do a job, where I go home and I don't think about it till the next Monday. yeah, on the other hand. I think about money, about the future. So so yeah I think I just have a constant low level anxiety, am I going to get a job, am I going to get a job and make it to get a job and I can't just. Like the little tiny job that I have now it's not enough to kick me off of the state, health insurance that I have for free it's small enough it doesn't count and the State doesn't count the alimony. for whatever reason, sorry. So I have health insurance, I mean it's a disaster like yesterday I made a doctor's appointment for December 2 because that's the first time they could see me. When you have state health insurance you don't get the perks of. You know, getting to choose your doctor and getting a quick, you know you have. to jump through a million a million hoops. yeah but it's free and I have this little tiny job. That isn't enough to kick me out. But at some point, I have to jump in and get a full time job, but I also have to have one that either has benefits or pays me enough that I can turn around and buy insurance. And that's a big jump. If I get like a half time job i'm going to lose my state insurance."
726.0,Provider,He.
13730.0,Patient,"kind of this awkward position i'm. In where I have to jump big I can't like a friend of mine said, well, we could hire you for 20 hours a week at this boutique and I thought I can't do that there were no benefits or anything, and I said I can't i'll lose my insurance. Eight I won't have, I have to, I have to show up and that feels really big that I have to make this jump somehow. I don't know. I don't really know the answer."
726.0,Provider,"Virginia to it's like. Okay, I understand. What you're saying, because I think a lot of people that do have high positions in life, sometimes you just want to do a mindfulness job that doesn't mean you overthink. They just get by and just live. Right and so."
13730.0,Patient,"yeah I see i'm gonna MOP floors I swear to God i'm gonna MOP floors. which I may, although right now, if I look at my resume they even call me i'm overqualified."
726.0,Provider,Never to it's like.
13730.0,Patient,there's that.
726.0,Provider,"So, like the thing is Virginia that you're a smart woman you you're thinking ahead before something is to happen right it's not that you don't have the capability. It might just be that, at this moment in time, things are slow down when you have the ability, or the flexibility to explore different different avenues for things that you might really want to do, or like to do."
13730.0,Patient,Right yeah.
726.0,Provider,"You are fully capable of of getting you know, being able to provide for yourself, you know you're doing everything possible so in really at the end of the day, it's it's that feeling of. What will truly make you feel at peace and really like you you're in your purpose like you feel like from the heart, you you're happy where you're at. In your life because it almost sounds like you're building foundations for yourself, right now, because you are starting. You were with someone for a very long time you're starting all on your own and so it's a different phase in your life, right now, when you're building yourself up literally from the ground up work money, all of these things."
13730.0,Patient,"yeah and I have figured out like I figured out how to understand my checking account, which I did not when I got divorced I didn't know how to handle money at all. And so i've learned in fact i'm really proud that I have three credit cards in my wallet that each have a balance of about 10% of my credit limit i'm building my credit score and i'm. learning about so i'm really I have so many things i'm proud of, but I still it's like there's a stigma because I don't have a job. And it feels yucky. I don't want to be. I also live in a suburb where. There are a lot of women that are what I don't want to be right now, I see a lot of we society social media calls i'm Karen. I feel so bad for people they care so awful oh yeah. But I live in a suburb. full of karen's everywhere, I look. Who they go to the nail salon they play tennis they go to the gym and they complain. And I feel like i'm one of them, and I don't want I don't want that I don't want to be like that I come from a city, full of a lot of racism and I it's very frustrating. Town, I live in I didn't really know that when I moved in and i'm actually trying to kind of move to different suburb but um. I think i'm so horrified I was at costco yesterday with my daughter, and I. saw this woman in her tennis outfit talking to an employee about a product she wanted and they didn't have it, she was so mean to him, and then I heard her on the phone describing the young man. inaccurately saying he'd said things he hadn't said, and then I saw her go to a manager and i'd like to I couldn't figure out why I was so invested in this women's business and I finally thought because i'm so scared that i'll be her. I don't want to be the woman who has everything provided for her like here I sit with my medicare which costs too much money. And so I sit here with my manicure in my pretty apartment. And I complain, because my only job is a crossing guard and it feels kind of I feel like i'm turning into that woman and I don't want to be that one. Like when I was. A stay at home mom. I don't think I was ever like that. It was really important to me like, for instance, when we first moved to California, we lived in the suburbs I didn't like it, I liked being in the city more. And I said I don't think I can handle the suburbs, because people are just so privileged and All they do is complain and I I don't like that I don't want to be like that. I never did I never wanted to. never wanted to be like that, but. Anyway, I I just I feel like i'm i'm stuck in a place in a category and I just want to break out of it being a different one. and Go ahead."
726.0,Provider,"Well i'm because i'm listening and you know how you're talking about being published right. And they asked like. You know I think a lot of people in this world have different. privileges, no matter what. No matter what group you're kind of in. Everyone has a different kind of privilege that they have. And so I wonder if you could separate feeling like you, are privileged by that defining who you are because at the end of the day, your privileges if that's not you that's how. that's how maybe the bigger system come see you. But does that to find you."
13730.0,Patient,"know no i'm not very much doesn't i've there have been lots of times in my life, where I have recognized areas of privilege that were making me a jerk and as soon as I recognized it, I immediately said oh wow That has to change, right now, i've done the very best I could. With we do the best we can, with the information that we have, and I was brought up. With a lot of education and there's been I was just relating at something to a friend, the other day, something that happened a few years ago um my sisters and I used to sometimes send around texts. It might be like my sister's child's first grade teacher sent him a letter from the school talking about what we're going to learn this year. And my sisters like it's full of spelling and grammatical errors, why is she a first grade teacher kind of thing and we're. criticizing it and I remember, thinking it felt kind of icky and then like it and I finally said, you know well that that's actually one reason I homeschool is because, because I did homeschool is because I see that the system is broken, and I would like it to be better. But this teacher, while she's evidence of the brokenness of the system she's stuck in it to. You she knew there were grammatical and spelling errors I guarantee you she would not have sent the letter out. So she doesn't know she doesn't realize she doesn't know how to choose a know what this quickly blue and red line mean on her computer. yeah most of us would never send it out with those underneath it, but she did so she doesn't know. So let's not let's not make fun of someone for what they don't have or what they don't know but anyway, a few years later. I saw somebody talk about the idea that someone calling themselves a grammar Nazi just a phrase, I would have used for myself was basically the elitist component to. Being a racist. And I was just like. that's so true Why would I make fun of someone I don't have good grammar because I worked hard for good grammar I have good grammar because i've never heard bad grammar in my home and I got free tuition at a college, because my parents were professors there and I got an English degree. that's why I have good grammar. it's not like I did anything, it was. Given, it was bestowed upon me. So the people who don't have good grammar. Nobody gave that to them. And why would I, why would I criticize someone. For something they don't have that like that's oh it's just terrible it's icky and I remember when I read that I just vowed to myself that I would never ever do that again and I thought everybody laughs. and makes jokes, but I feel like i'm not allowed to make that joke that's not an okay job for me to make. I have. Too many grammar privileges given to me, I will never again make fun of anybody for the grammar and I don't I don't even correct my kids anymore i'm just like i'm done. it's done and, in fact, one thing. Just to you know I like to tell a good story I think i'm an n gram nine. i'm pretty sure. They tell stories right. So to to make the story go full circle, have you ever heard this on redneck woman. Yes, okay okay. wait for it. I went to school with her."
726.0,Provider,Sir.
13730.0,Patient,"I went to say I did I went to school with Gretchen Wilson. hurley her last name was not Wilson at the time it was multi I went to school with her. yeah so The other day I listened to the song and heard it in a while, and I was like so she's making this wonderful career out of. Her hardship she's writing about her. hardships, I was listening, but he tells them, they were really vivid vivid, for me, because I know what she looks like I know what her house look like I know where she lives. it's very real, to me, and all of a sudden, I thought and it's people like me who pushed her down and she finally fought back against it and that's where her success comes from. i'm the mean girl in this story, and she doesn't mention the mean girl. But if there was a mean girl and her story, and she listed 50 100 mean girls in her life, I would be on the list. She and I were not particularly friends, we were acquaintances she slept with my boyfriend in fact it's terrible but. But again, she didn't have a lot of privilege."
726.0,Provider,And then I listened to that another.
13730.0,Patient,"song on like on the B side of the album where she sings about she says i'm the biggest thing that ever came from my hometown. And i'll be damned if i'm going to let them down she says before they lay me in the ground i'm going to make them proud and I just I kind of started to cry a little bit of a thought. And I used to be somebody would look down on her in fact. I literally looked down on her. If you would have a list of girls I looked down on Gretchen would have been on my list Gretchen was a trashy girl at school, that I thought I was better than. And so, listening to her song the other night really it helped me kind of refined my thoughts about as I, as I move forward in a career, or whether it's a career, whether it's just a day job. I don't want to be the kind of woman that makes the Gretchen wilson's of the world feel rotten because I literally was that. And it's a hilarious story I know. But I actually went to school with her. yeah she's yeah we're both from like the boonies. yeah but I was a different person in the town and she was and I just I don't want I don't want to be that person, so I think also wrapped up in all this career stuff is don't I don't want to get a job that would encourage me to look down my nose at one more person."
726.0,Provider,In this working I.
13730.0,Patient,"don't I don't want that I always felt bad about it i'm i'm such a lover you know. So i'm hoping, I can find a job, where. Either I can love, or I can just go to work and look like right now, while i'm at the crossing guard post, I have an audio book running in my pocket and listening to a story because it's so dull it's so. Important I was about to kill me. So anyway that that's kind of the story, but it's just I have all these feelings and I think a lot of it is. I don't want to be a Karen I want to be a kind person, I want to be a person of love. I want to be a responsible person who takes care of myself I just there's a lot of things that I want that are good things in life and. And i'm watching the time go by. And I just don't want to. lose my chance to. To have a positive impact. On people around me and so forth."
726.0,Provider,"Well Virginia, you have a good heart, and you have empathy for other people, and you know."
13730.0,Patient,or yeah I do probably much. and
726.0,Provider,"If you yeah if you think about those times, or maybe just something that that you look at regrettably it's like you also didn't know better, probably didn't understand and."
13730.0,Patient,know.
726.0,Provider,"You know it's like i'm sure you were a kid so it's kind of like like the way you show compassion for others. yeah yourself and have some compassion for yourself, because a lot of the things that you're doing right now."
13730.0,Patient,A lot of things that you you're you're learning.
726.0,Provider,"These are things that you know will will make you feel vulnerable because you're starting again, and you, this is a new. Time so have compassion for yourself, you know you don't have to be perfect you just have to do what you can do each day, but you don't have to be perfect ever No one."
13730.0,Patient,"Perfect I. Normally perfectionism I mean it's probably obvious I put I put a way higher standard on myself than anyone else and. I suspect that anxious people probably tends to be those who set a very high standard. A lot I mean I guess anxiety can be caused by a lot of things, but it seems to me like in many cases it's caused by us like we we don't mean to. But we create an unsustainable untenable position. in which to live. And it causes anxiety. But um. But I guess the good news is if I created it then I should be able to alter it. yeah if i've created this fictional world where I have to do things that aren't realistic that I realistically cannot do. You know I can't fix. I can't go back and be nicer to Gretchen. It would be nice but that's just not the way it works and don't get me wrong, I was never mean to her face I just was maybe headed back."
726.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
13730.0,Patient,"It was just funny listening to her somebody I went to a fall festival, and someone was singing that song, and I said oh my gosh I know her. And then I went home and listen to it and I just went oh. But."
726.0,Provider,"You learn you're learning from from that experience. And yeah and you're it think of it this way, you are not repeating the same mistake evil is evil is continuously repeating something of a negative act over and over again, with no with no care or worrying for anybody else just what the right."
13730.0,Patient,"And you know what I don't think my children will ever do that, then I mean my kids aren't perfect, but I have raised them with this conviction of, we are not going to be big times. In fact that's one reason I home I homeschool them is, I just wanted a chance to teach them in a way that didn't follow a particular I felt like when kids went to school, especially in my hometown everyone had to be the same, and I wanted them to be able to think for themselves. it's funny. I think I succeeded, I have four kids and I think. i'm looking at how they live and how they live life and sometimes i'm like you guys, but I don't think my goal was the day, not be academic stops they're not. Not at all, one of my son's works in a machine he's a machinist."
726.0,Provider,Oh cool.
13730.0,Patient,"And so i'm like you know what. A little. Understanding sometimes like when my youngest is in Cosmetology school. who's a professional musician she's a completely broke starving artist. A college degree. That he's paying off while working as a photographer and surfing all day so none of them on the white collar route that I. yeah check to education, I don't object to jobs. I just didn't want them to be assholes. And I don't think they are."
726.0,Provider,Thank you raise them that way.
13730.0,Patient,"No all those I do sometimes my youngest will make jokes about grammar and spelling and i'm like stop it, I understand you. you're right spell check and grammar check there's no excuse we're still going to stop. So you know, sometimes they still get can get a little snotty which we all can. Yes, well do. We all be or sometimes terrible."
