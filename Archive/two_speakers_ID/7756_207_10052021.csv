207.0,Provider,How are you.
7756.0,Patient,"i'm good. just another day in Paradise which I learned last night and I we pull up when we go to take the trash out. me and our neighbor he's kind of like. weird though he, like when we first moved in like he was arguing one night and he comes out and he shines a light need to stairs and then like. We asked them for a jump one day if he had jumper cables and he just don't really talk, I thought he was slow, but I think it's weird because he's a drunk but we pull by embrace like that's a shop good whoa box like and we've had a lot of our packages come up missing well. Here we look in it's our it's her 24 pound jewelry lot this you just ordered and He threw the box away he cut the name off the top and. that's the receipt inside with his mail and throw the box away well we comes in, and it was supposed to be delivered yesterday, so we can then we had to call the COPs and everything because it's been happening and. So we when he came out he tried it when he seen us take the trash out he turned on is like it was at 430 this morning. He turned on all the lights he turned on his porch light he opened his door and he just stared out the window like for two hours probably he knew, but we so we went to ask them I have it on video and he was like. Well, why are you calling the COPs it was in my mailbox and I was like I mean it's 24 pounds it don't fit in your mailbox first of all. And second off like why don't you look at the name of it and he's like no does anybody look at the name on their mail and I was like I mean i'm pretty sure everybody does you know least we do."
207.0,Provider,So i'm not trying to get anybody bills in my mailbox.
7756.0,Patient,"yeah so he he literally he told me he said yeah he I think he's been stealing off report. He said um. She said well we're i'm just waiting on the call but because it's been something happening, and he said well um yeah he told her not to call to call them and tell them not to come, he said what was his word, he said. you're not in the position to call the COPs right now only was like what does i've never mean. You really don't know about him well the COP here the COP come back and said he's just an old guy who likes to fish and hunt. I think and he's just setting is set in his ways and you guys are different, you know being lesbians, so he he thinks he don't like us, because he walked him to mailbox. yeah so he walked in the mailbox. And he told him, then. So. that's just our neighbors now. every weekend good. Targets for something I guess he's been in trouble. He turns 18 says, I mean look at your chart. raise a patient now she got in on Friday yesterday."
207.0,Provider,Oh.
7756.0,Patient,I got a seven days clean she got seven days clean off of it. Karen kane is her doctor she seems like a really nice.
207.0,Provider,character cane or Julie.
7756.0,Patient,Oh yeah Julie Julie came right Julie kane. I don't know I said Karen I.
207.0,Provider,"don't know what you want, we can rename and."
7756.0,Patient,"Karen Jane sounds like. Some sure someone's name Karen kane. Now, with her options of counselors is it just you phyllis manny and cheryl."
207.0,Provider,you're hiring your while. yeah. yeah yeah no no there's more. there's.
7756.0,Patient,"More told us we can do together, and some people told us we can't."
207.0,Provider,"know. Okay, this is the real one. Because he can't handle cheryl."
7756.0,Patient,yeah she shuts down and people push too hard so she needs somebody it's more you know.
207.0,Provider,i'm know there's there's there's more than just my world and many there's there's other there's other towns and i'm. This is the thing you can she can. I think truly is she doesn't Julie doesn't only work with cheryl I think she works with phyllis.
7756.0,Patient,She said she doesn't want to share. As.
207.0,Provider,Other you can when she when she speaks to the virtual clinic. She you said she said she only did run groups with cheryl.
7756.0,Patient,Now she said she does a lot with them with her.
207.0,Provider,"lot of groups what's our fee yeah no I. don't so ideally Okay, so I don't run your roots right. But I right Conference so it's not it's it's preferably by heart is moving to attaching the therapist to the group."
7756.0,Patient,"counseling right. A lot of sense, though, because. You have you know a little more hands on like understand."
207.0,Provider,"Jeffrey can you you're with you, so you are who are you who's your facilitator."
7756.0,Patient,I have Wednesday group with cheryl and then I have Thursday with manny.
207.0,Provider,um you have to group.
7756.0,Patient,yeah I do pain management to cuz my backs.
207.0,Provider,"So okay so but it's Okay, there is not a hard and it's it's not a hard and fast like that that's, the only way, so you can have a different counselor then whoever runs the group. And, ie you're the perfect example of that. Now you could request another counselor is."
7756.0,Patient,"No, I don't want to request another counseling or you're talking about her I."
207.0,Provider,"know her i'm talking about her. So yes, it would be ideal not to have the same for you both not to be in the same town so because, at the end of the day, your session is your session and not to say that you guys are keeping secrets from each other, but your session in your session and you want to have that level of. Privacy able to open up and share because. The truth of the matter is no matter what relationship you're in. There are certain things about your password that may come up that maybe you are not in a place where you feel you're ready to open up to your partner, and so, therefore. You want to talk to your comfort and work through that before you open up the share certain things about your past co partner right."
7756.0,Patient,"Right yeah different peoples on different levels, I get that. I understand that completely when he was on the phone with her doctor, she was like I because I tend to like I tend to stop like i'll say some. And i'm like don't forget or asked her this because I heard that the group is over, after the code like when they get covered under control, they said that they're going to stop Tele health. So I told her I should ask, but she was like it's hard for me to talk and then see you saying that, so I get it."
207.0,Provider,"yeah yeah now I don't know not ever, of course, the state is different because I think in in Ohio they have expanded it, I think, no I don't know that there, once they have stopped because if they stopped Tele health, that means that will happen to very hard. very, very hard."
7756.0,Patient,"What they're saying they're not saying it's closed yet, but it scares me like."
207.0,Provider,"I believe, is what they will do is that okay so initially when I first. started with burning heart what they did was, I think, like so the doctor needed to be messing state with you, and so, if you want it to be a part of my heart, I think your first initial appointment with the prescriber you had to physically go see them face."
7756.0,Patient,"me there, I wonder in. Patients that there will be, we be good."
207.0,Provider,"Again, it just depends on your face it just because it because I think they just extended it because of thing getting bad I think they started. I think I read something where they were wanting that I think your first like you have to at least have one face to face which i'm not sure i'm not in Ohio so, then I would have been. a lawyer. So, but it's I think they changed me they said they keep extending it that's what it is they may whenever rule that they the guidelines and the protocols are extending it. But you know what if that comes, this is kind of how I how I work with everyone if that means. I don't know I don't think I the one time that you weren't in the group that I ran that I ran for cheryl that went on, with after so. I don't know if I had said it, but like i'm on the firm belief it's like there's a season there's a time and a season for everything right, and so, when you think about the leaf like you're in a state where the seasons change, you can visibly see the changes of the season right. Right corner you'll see diddly squat, it is the same year round. desert is the same year around the leaves are green year round. And knows me dropping off the no true. So it's a okay so as the seasons change there's going to be a vast difference right so now we're getting ready to enter into fall, what are you going to see the flowers blooming and you're gonna see the different variations and the colors and all of. And so you think about your life, like the changes in the season that we experiment i'm only going to be your counselor and with the UK law for only a season. And, just like what the changes of the season, the leaves fall off because leaves don't fail entry forever they fall out a new ones Come on, they fall off a new i'm going to be one of those leads. And once I leave another one another therapist will come into your life now each leaf that comes on that tree each new leaf serves a purpose. There is there to implant or plant something within you or teach you something along life's way once that lease is gone, you should be able to reflect on what you ever learned. During that phase of your life because I am here for this season of your life after a while I ain't gonna do nothing for you. i'm not going to be necessarily helping you the way you need help, because you would have grown, you would have flourished and you don't need me anymore. Now somebody else is coming and they're watering your, in fact, if you do think about the changes of the season that's how our lives are things. So if if if this is true where would close it is opened up the opportunity for a lot of Tele health for everybody to do this total health counseling to see their doctors and all of that. capitalize on it, while you can."
7756.0,Patient,yeah I know.
207.0,Provider,"What you take from it, what you can because they come to the point where. When it all shuts down, then, and you have to physically now, you will be at a place where it is not something that you necessarily need to do every single week like you're doing online maybe it will get to that place where you ain't do it once a month or once every other month. And okay."
7756.0,Patient,"Okay, can you still hear me and cuts out on me. yeah you had the other one don't start on this group with me please. My phone's cutting out because I had to take my dog out she attacked louie again."
207.0,Provider,"So that's part of it so that's what i'm saying you know it's best to be in different groups, it is best to be in different groups."
7756.0,Patient,"Easy beta yeah and I was. gonna say so, I had an appointment with you, and they they rescheduled it very I cannot go no further. They rescheduled it because they said, your husband was sick, so I rescheduled it well, my one with Dr tsao so I even send them a picture of my I have the copy of the email and I sent it to them, they. They sent me the email, and it said 12pm they even told me on the phone this 12pm Pacific time so I myself I. talked to him, so it was like 315 with my appointment, or something and I just I even stayed up all night because I i'm not a good morning person, so I even I went in the ladies like know your appointment was it Eastern time. Well i'm here and it passed, but I had had the copy of the screen the email, so I gave it to her, but I don't know because I still only got 12 pills, but and then Dr sell this week gave me 24 because I mentioned it, so I don't know if maybe they did they fix it. Because I freak out. Because I should be like every other week now you know i've been there, so long, like I do two groups faithfully every week i'm not really sure what would be holding me back I passed my urine screens like. I participate in group. I make my appointments, but the only one that had the issue was right, even my appointment with you, but they told me that your husband got sick, so they rescheduled it."
207.0,Provider,I remember hold on I remember your appointment and you miss it and I thought it was kind of odd how you missed it because.
7756.0,Patient,"Well, for my last week, I was logging in and it kept kicking me off kicking me off and i've been having a lot of problems I just went and got a new phone Finally I don't know I haven't even got it turned on yet, but it's an A 42. go too far. But i'm hoping that might give me a better zoom call or something. Because the care navigators and I told her like you guys can see that I was logging on, so why does that exclude me and she's like well. She only has set times for people, so I missed yours by like 10 minutes, but I was literally just trying to log on."
207.0,Provider,"Well, you know I know you said that you live in West Virginia right."
7756.0,Patient,"yeah well we was staying in West Virginia and the flooring done yeah and now we got career marbles in under the flooring and now it's leaking water up through and Greg hasn't came back so he hasn't came back to fix it. So maybe Come on, so our House is still it's still tore up everywhere, but now all the sudden, I think I don't know cloud like it's weird it's like he sabotage, is it just so he can have work it's it's like a far fetched you wouldn't believe it, you know just to hear it, but. You know."
207.0,Provider,today's Tuesday. I. think you have a good day at eight o'clock.
7756.0,Patient,"They know they canceled that group member phyllis done that group, and she canceled it they quit it because there's only a few people there."
207.0,Provider,"Okay, so you only do one thing."
7756.0,Patient,But I faithfully i've done that. i'd say probably since May at mom can't gonna further.

7756.0,Patient,"yeah the 14th was cancelled and then. The next one, I had an appointment for you and I, every time I would log in it would just kicked me off. It would just it and then my zoom restarted and everything, so I mean I. My new phone works beta come. I have my new phone does better on it, because i've been having a lot of problems with it, but i've never I mean I don't miss groups I go to my groups I. participate, I do everything that I should be doing, I mean minus that couple appointments, but the care navigators did take the picture of the letter from them, the email stating that.

I just want to move up, I want to get started, better aveda my dog attacks Louis again like just out the blue and nothing was even happening like they were just sitting there. There, because when I get my medicine on to take it she's really hyper so recalls her over there, so, while i'm taking so I can get my medicine on my bottle. invaded don't mess with me well, they were just sitting there both of them, and she just snapped all the sudden really bad she's lucky that he had a caller on because she really got him bad, but because she had a caller he had a caller on she didn't get them is bad."

You haven't really you're still somewhat mentally emotionally unstable on our have some unrest within this season how very really on the next the next season comes with its own challenges right.
