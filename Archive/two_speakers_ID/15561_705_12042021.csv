15561.0,Patient,Yes.
705.0,Provider,"perfect. Do you like, to be called domini do you like, to be called the sometimes people have a nickname."
15561.0,Patient,nope dominic is fine.
705.0,Provider,"Okay. Well, was zoom you know you, you made it to the appointment and you saw you checked in so I mean this is great, a lot of times, it takes. Time and practice with zoom so you know dominic it seems like you already have that down."
15561.0,Patient,"yeah yes, I do unfortunately I have to teach other people how to use zoom. I do a lot of training in classes on zoom."
705.0,Provider,"Oh wow well, you might be able to share with us some of the ins and outs it's a different platform I was used to working with like salesforce or what does it go to meeting, sir. Google duo."
15561.0,Patient,"No i'm only I think proficient in in zoom. Because that's how we use zoom. Some of other like meetings outside of my college or. What is it Program. i've a couple other ones, but zoom is pretty much like 100% that all mining."
705.0,Provider,me it's my preference I like zoom better it's for me it's like user friendly some of the others it's just i'm just going to lack of better words clunky like it's just like where do I have to go way over here just to get to my audio.
15561.0,Patient,"yeah and zoom has basically during the pandemic basically like heard all the complaints and as its as I could say like from lash what 2020 when it begins to now it has. gotten a lot better. A lot. Recently, a lot of really user friendly. dumb friendly because I like to say, sometimes I do deal with. Multi generation, you know family so sometimes we do have like you know grandmas and grandpas who are like I still got a flip phone I don't have a house, I still have you know, a landline. And so, sometimes trying to get them on there's like just you opened your email just just click on that link that's it because I. That losing my lights up where's your grandkids you know so."
705.0,Provider,"Yes, yes."
15561.0,Patient,I love. One of the weird where where one of your grandkids one of these foster kids wanted some kid. But I figured some of these parents are like doing a little bit better because of social distancing being online that also claim to help the little bit the parents so.
705.0,Provider,"I have a couple of individual sessions i'm doing and I believe the oldest one is 72 and I am so impressed because they had some challenges as expected, but they've done really well and dedicated and i'm just blown away like oh. No went from their their phone because it was too little to the iPad and now they're in groups and doing the different reactions."
15561.0,Patient,reactions to.
705.0,Provider,Oh dominic if you ever have a for a bio site social intake assessment before.
15561.0,Patient,I don't know.
705.0,Provider,"I know I usually ask that and most people are like I don't know for sure people call a bps it's basically. gathering information it's more about looking at some of your past looking at what's going on currently and then trying to see you know how we can help you best. it's different than a counseling session and a counseling session like a one on one what we'll be doing is exploring like we'll talk about coping skills would explore that a little bit more. Where and what we're doing today is more questions and you'll see me look side to side, where i'm looking at my guidelines so that's you know, the main difference, also to an intake you probably remember signing forums about confidentiality and privacy. If if someone tomorrow outside of bright heart health says hey Valerie you did that you know the bio psychosocial yesterday with Dominique how that what was the outcome. I can't confirm or deny that I even know you until you sign the release form and so we're you know today, you can feel like that you can be open. With confidentiality, the limits that we have is we're mandated. For like elder abuse or child abuse, if you share that you're going to hurt yourself and we're going to get you support. And we're going to get you know let's say if you're homeless title and you're going to hurt someone we're going to get them support in you support outside of that if some urgency, that of course we're going to call 911. outside of that dominic it's confidential we do work as a team so there's different groups that that you'll you'll probably be going to and you probably already talked about the groups and we're like what day Jordi settle all that. Yes, okay okay great so as a team we work together, I was just going to look to it looks like you're going to be working with oh great with Mary kastner and then do you know what time. Is it the 12 o'clock on Tuesdays you're doing. For groups."
15561.0,Patient,12 o'clock. on Mondays. Nice.
705.0,Provider,"What i'm looking let's see. i'm looking at, let me just. Looking at your chart here. i'm it looks like your next appointment is 12 seven at 12 o'clock I have just my paper calendar here too it looks like that's on a Tuesday and then the 14th would be your next group which is on a Tuesday. room yeah."
15561.0,Patient,it's the Monday.
705.0,Provider,"yeah i'm glad we're going over this that's why I always like to see because it's a Tuesday it's not going to work for you, then I can write to your care navigator."
15561.0,Patient,"Because i'm guessing that as the the meeting. Those are different, but I hope she gave me the correct one for Monday noon."
705.0,Provider,"let's see. Monday noon i'm just going to see if I can look into the inquiries to to see if there's anything. still just reading here dominic if you see me kind of looking down just seeing, if I can find where. yeah right now, then. i'm reading the seventh at 12 the 14th the 21st and the 28. you're needing Mondays. And you're trying to do a Monday at 12."
15561.0,Patient,"yeah I said Monday, because I know for sure I won't be able to do tuesday's. Okay 12."
705.0,Provider,"i'll car what I will do Dominique is after we finish you and I, this usually takes about a good 45 minutes, and then I will send your care navigator which is jolene. Last name is going to go jar I will send your care navigator that helps to share that you and I talked today and that the to Tuesday was never something that you are agreeing to your agreed to Monday and to please. You know, correct that and then we'll be able to go from there, so if you get like come to the virtual Center that's what it's going to be about after this. Okay yeah with confidentiality, then, and your privacy ID have any questions about that before we get going. nope okay and i'm sorry that that that happened i'm. they'll be able to help you i'm just. You know I know how it is it's like i'm getting it set up but i'm glad that we kind of reviewed it together. Okay, so one of the first things I like to ask is the reason that you decided to join bright heart health."
15561.0,Patient,"come down to I think me trying to. get my mental health back in order. A lot has been going on in my life. And then I am trying to get back to were getting therapy, to see that with also my medication and hopefully with therapy I couldn't get it back on your control. Because I know it's starting to. affect my work. and You know. kind of dealing with. A new health diagnosis that i'm not too fond of. And kind of being able to cope with that. But mainly just trying to get me back to. Normal. As can be. Because it's yeah like I said it's interfering into my day to day life."
705.0,Provider,"Well i'm glad that you joined by heart health and I know that a lot of times, people will suffer in silence in a site there's a better way, and you can share and come up with new coping skills and it is. Sometimes, with a disorder, it is at first like Okay, I wanted to know what was what What could it maybe be Now I know now, I have to work through that and process it. After that, it usually is then coming to more of an understanding, where then it's like okay. Now we know this, you can have a greater understanding of maybe some things are happening because this you know you can look at some of the characteristics of the the mental health disorder and be like okay. Now let's see what maybe can apply better than maybe if you were you know, sometimes people will talk about they were misdiagnosed and they're thinking, they have something else going on and trying to understand it it's not matching up. So being able to be like you know what okay Now I know and let's see where I can get some relief and with coping skills and Mary is a genius when it comes to working with people and getting the right medication. she's wonderful she listens she will at your pace like Okay, what do you think about you know, maybe this might work better, maybe not the more that I can just you know share like be the open and honest with her. The more that she can be like you know what Okay, this is what we're going to do, like I know before. Getting in tune with what's going on and let's say if you're going to manic phase where people will be able to share with Mary hey this is what's happening, I feel the search coming. And that she's able to maybe up some of the dosage where it starts to balance out more where it's not such the high and the lows. So there's a lot that can be done and then with the different coping techniques to a combination. It doesn't take the disorder away, but you will more and more become like you know what i'm confident that I can manage this. Now this is something that I welcomed in, but it is here. i'm going to know how to manage it, and you will. So if there's anything that you know that I can do to assist you to support you, that by heart health we work as a team. don't hesitate. Cry again, this is a huge step it's just signing up most people you know they need therapy, but they don't ever sign up for it it's just like they would rather do anything else besides be here and talk about it so good for you. yeah right now to you know part of where I look at my guidelines here is what city and State do you live in right now so."
15561.0,Patient,I live in San Leandro California.
705.0,Provider,"And then, who do you live with right now."
15561.0,Patient,So currently I live with my two children my sister and my paternal aunt.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, and you probably I know, to thank you for filling out your history questionnaire and I believe some of this was in here that I believe you have one son one daughter. Yes, okay. Great what are their ages."
15561.0,Patient,My son is 14 and then my daughter she'll be turning 10 Christmas Eve this.
705.0,Provider,"Is that, like a preteen and then teenager right. yeah I know where does tenant and what did what 10 I see sometimes I say pre teen."

705.0,Provider,Everybody needs a routine right.
15561.0,Patient,super happy they.
705.0,Provider,"Good good good good. As far as to then. So we found out, you know we talked about that a little bit more who were your main caretakers growing up."
15561.0,Patient,My name. i'd have to say so from third grade on. It was my my dad and my step mom. And then before that I believe my grandma or a couple you.
705.0,Provider,know with any family history of like substance use disorder mental health use our mental health disorders.
15561.0,Patient,"substance abuse, yes, both of my man. Like I say all three of them so look my. Both my parents, at least up here oh done substance abuse in the past. and The ones I kind of got in the third grade. My. that's when I was reunited, so I was able to move in with my father, so I was technically and kinship care chosen. My grandma's taking care of US kind of foster care what like. And then. We were able to get reunited back with my dad and my stepmom. Because they've done all they needed to do. I think my when my sister was born that's when my dad kind of come into the office. And started to get clean and."
705.0,Provider,sober okay. Were you then dominate guy any childhood like views rather that was like emotional or mental physical or sexual abuse.
15561.0,Patient,"Not that I and. physically like my memory, I mean the earliest memory, I have is probably when were removed from CPS you know replace yes. and Actually, I like I it's a glimpse of like when my brother unfortunately got burned, and then, when we move from CBS, but they are older siblings. They described my early years is probably not. kind of like neglect and plus the most of my parents were still using drugs. and alcohol."
705.0,Provider,acquired. How about did you second dominic your when the CPS came in and remove you from the home.
15561.0,Patient,So I had to be about four or five.
705.0,Provider,Did you ever received any type of counseling after that or anytime like in your in your younger like teenagers or. or in grade school.
15561.0,Patient,Not that I couldn't know.
705.0,Provider,"Do you have, and I know some of your your siblings have told me, like some of it, do you have you know, sometimes people will say that they still have trauma where they're piecing it together and they can visualize some of the things anything like that for you."
15561.0,Patient,"yeah so sometimes. And that's I say like when they're saying certain things sometimes it's like okay. I can. visualize it. Like I know like I said, like my professional my brother got burnt. soup counter. On the counter. And so it's just that's my details, but then, as my other than it's more than it's like Oh, I guess, it was a couple of years, who I just knew it was hot liquid. And then it became that it was secretly Nixon and then it's like when it was I making this. up so like and then things like that kind of fully."
705.0,Provider,Did you witness him being burned by the soup.
15561.0,Patient,"In the sense of. The as far as it goes, is that him reaching up. Okay, and then. kind of like the reaching up. like that, and then after that it's kind of blink."
705.0,Provider,Is. There any other like. trauma in your childhood like anything else that you witnessed or.
15561.0,Patient,"I mean for me i'm starting to learn so with part of my job I do a secure education and so as as my trainers teach. Some of the traumas and things like that i'm i'm learning. and finding out what's what's what's normal and what's not normal. In traumatic events like so once it to me. Apparently, I guess that's normal. Because I remember, like my mom on the long side and another, so another woman, you know for me i'm like oh that's cool. yeah and i'd be like."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and you probably are learning more about that in childhood trauma is. From a child's eyes, because you were so young and you're trying to make sense and process what's going on. And it affects you and in different ways, and then you bring that into your adulthood, and especially with inside it. A lot of times with anxiety goes back to childhood when things happen, and then we develop core beliefs, because of it, and like you said it was normal to hear fighting and and chaos that was that was your normal. You get older and you realize that Oh, could it be some of my anxiety was driven before you know, because if you have an impaired parent. they're not able to provide for you at the time the security, you know the safety, the love all of those things to help you develop, and so a lot of times in society sets in and then you carry that, through your adulthood. i'm glad that you're talking about it and taking you know, like okay. You and I are what we usually do is work on coping skills, especially when it comes to anxiety taking a look at like with depression doing like mood logs things like that. As you go along, and what you think will help you best. And then, what we do is, if you filled and Dominique at a certain point where you're like you know what i'm ready to address the trauma more some of these things that maybe I witness, we have a really good her and her name is Cindy and she's on our team, and she does em Dr. Have you heard of the different tapping techniques that help with trauma it's. Okay it's great it's a technique that it doesn't take away the trauma, but it lessens like the intensity. Where things become more manageable and so that would be something to that you know a lot of times if you're coming into groups and you're doing individual counseling and they asked first the coping skills first. Or, then you go to the trauma, because if you go trauma first it's too much without proper coping skills. So something just to keep you know when when you want to talk about it more we can talk about that too, but i'm glad that. Now you're able to see that yeah even though that was normal in your household that it's not normal and everybody's household and how does that affect a person, especially a small child. Has there been. Any domestic violence or anything like that in your adulthood."
15561.0,Patient,"Yes, okay."
705.0,Provider,"And then, no military service. And then spirituality for you is important, yes. Do you like to practice your spirituality is there anything that you draw on."
15561.0,Patient,"I guess right now, I guess, I can say, like right now my my spiritual ality journey is and that's again with my depression it's starting to kind of fact. Some of my practices that I do as an. When I do church, you know, being able to go and really focus. During my. church. or even to just even praying. I feel like it's starting to be like fragmented and it's like it. it's gotta. Be it and i'm like some days i'm like yes, another is like. I don't think. So you know before I could say yes. and move on. Focusing in church I kind of know now we're not going. To be kind of like. devotion to blitz like. I probably haven't touched the Bible. Because that was one of my goals this year was to actually read the whole Bible."
705.0,Provider,And I probably stopped in.
15561.0,Patient,it's just it got to a point where any. I would just open it. In.
705.0,Provider,"No yeah there's no lack of like the lack of focus and just you can't concentrate and what depression allies hundred have any good, just to get out of bed, to get out of bed sometimes is a big win. move to another room outside of the bed sometimes it's a big win. And you know with that too is different coping techniques, I mean I work with someone that he has had a little plant that he put on the other side of the room that made him get up to water, the plant. And then you know the plants huge now and he's flourish too and it's like this parallel of growth of growth, you know so just this happening, like that, and with spirituality is to see. That goal, where maybe you had, and then it was sidetracked for a bit, but when you're ready is inviting that back in and and just seeing you know what you can do, and especially with focusing on. You know what is there, another way, while you're working through this that you can still get your spirituality needs met. it's Nice that you have that that you can you can draw on that is always good. What do you do for fun."
15561.0,Patient,"Okay. that's probably. The only thing I can. do right now. That is probably my favorite thing to still want to do. It used to be TV shows. Like I had a slew of shows that I love to watch like you know my lineup for the week that you know. But eventually stopped where I like. No longer wanted to do there's like very, very I think i'm down to one show. That I still. Like try to watch usually trying to keep it up weekly I think i'm like. I think i'm a month behind now. But right now I think probably eating and actually. yeah just reading."
705.0,Provider,Like some of the other things have last words no longer pleasure wall like maybe before watching TV was and now it's not.
15561.0,Patient,"Like. I think the TV, the only thing in the whole House, that does it turn on the most is probably my TV."
705.0,Provider,Is there a certain type of reading that you still enjoy.
15561.0,Patient,"um. I know that I switched from like books, because I love books to online reading like during my device. The genre I don't think has changed their book is a good book. More. fiction. But i've read both fiction and nonfiction."
705.0,Provider,"You know, with. with Dr customer and as you're finding you know with the medication and what may work for you, as some of the you know if he had hobbies in the past is some of those pleasurable activities may come back are discovering new ones. You might be at a place, you know, in a month from now where like you know what I actually want to key in on something different, I want to be able to you know get outside of myself and do something different."
15561.0,Patient,"yeah I tried, I mean I bought a sewing machine I bought some patterns. And I haven't watched it. Because I was trying to figure out. In that span like I need to try to turn around like I said I just got to a point where I just no longer. I guess keep up the facade. of being quote unquote happy, everything is fine, everything is normal. You know. it's you know, like pay attention to my right hand and worry about what my left hand is doing. or feel like my mask is, as I say, my mask is slipping. Like. Even with my medication. Come the uppers I call them the uppers and I might get I got a little energy to to you know, to keep on doing. mommy mommy stuff. Again, mandatory. And and roll out of bed. and And somebody was like ooh. Maybe maybe today, I could be X y&z in that right there just even thinking about doing some something. I think like for this whole week. Unfortunately, my pet lizard passed away."
705.0,Provider,i'm so sorry. How long did you ever get closer.
15561.0,Patient,or about going for a little over four years.
705.0,Provider,So.
15561.0,Patient,"I think when you mentioned the pin the guy with a plan that kind of think about my lizard in a way. Yes, because I mean i've been taking care of her and. And I noticed some things have changed in her and and, for me, I was like this is kind of like. That one thing and then that kind of. Somehow somewhere. You know she end up getting sick. And so. I kind of just go. get my own bed. it's."
705.0,Provider,"Like going in that she had something else going on, and then you did your best and."
15561.0,Patient,"yeah I mean. yeah because, like I said, like. It kinda also kind of like how I kind of been doing my life with my kind of parallels with my lizard like everything i've been trying to be everything that time. check in i'm still alive hey i'm still functioning a mask is good. And how I felt with my lizard know first daughter, and like first month. couple months later, oh still alive we're obviously doing something good. Until like i'm doing everything i'm doing in something."
705.0,Provider,"it's hard to because pets become part of your family and now and then is missing home, and it is just like mourning the loss, you know and taking that in. Matching that when you are depressed is feeling even more intense of like. you're essentially company, you are already going on just a little bit of energy, a little bit of like it was already depleted and at that really set you were it just kind of took the wind out of yourselves for a moment. and being able to be like you know what i'm i'm here i'm going to get back to when you when you're you're ready, you know, maybe you'll get to a place where. To get you know, to see if you're open to getting some other type of I know people always say no, I don't want to replace what I had before, and it's not replacing. just see if something else that you could also have where it is something that gives you that sense of purpose or that responsibility and that just little extra."
15561.0,Patient,"Well, we were already in the. plans of getting a new pet. So we're still working on getting the new pet were added to the family, adult so. That I mean that, unlike that motion is already in motion my entities and hopefully with a dog, it will help with my anxiety and depression. Because it's going to be fluffy in a bigger in it's kind of hard to cuddle with lizard. Well, my lizard because she is about this big as my as my hands like she was leopard gecko so it's kind of hard to cuddle with. Something that's more."
705.0,Provider,"You built a relationship and a bond and and it is and it's like Al having a dog I think will be great too and it's Nice because, even just as you're petting the dog. releases, you know, an already it releases your neural transmitters to put out some I feel better before you know you even know like hey this is that unconditional love and that they're there and they're just like you know, looking at you, and just kind of like. So if you already have that emotion is there, then like Is this something dominate that's going to happen, like this month."
15561.0,Patient,"It is it's going to happen because. Because my daughter wanted to go so it's kind of like a Christmas we're thinking. So. I had to be cautious, because even though because manti is allergic to dogs, so we. tried to do the research to kind of find. A dog that would be. A hypoallergenic. And, as I. started looking for the puppy so and. It was like yeah so all these puppies are boys, but they're all reason. I got lucky. With the puppy that we that we will be getting a couple."
705.0,Provider,"might be right on time, you know that might be great to have something a little bit different and distractions distraction now sometimes is good to have that type of distraction to. And then, if if you decide Dominique like you, you want to have your dog as a support animal like. Dr Murray caster and she's also done like a note, you know you can do the support dog and you just need like a node and a lot of places will allow you to bring the dog. If you need, though, the specifically trained on, then you know that's a whole other. course and stuff but it's Nice that the support dog, a lot of places will they recognize and there'll be able to to let you in if that's something you want to do. And you could just ask Mary he just share with her that you need a letter and usually the breed That way, you know they know it's not just anybody writing a writing a note yeah. it's something something to think about I wanted to see to her than one of the next question and I think you'd already. Basically fill it out here, it looks like with with substance use that physically, the only thing, maybe alcohol that you used when you're 16 and in the past 30 days, maybe you drank only a couple of times."
15561.0,Patient,"yeah like I, and that was just because I went to a social event, so I don't. Because I know that. Both of my parents were alcoholics and I knew that my paternal grandfather was an alcoholic like I know that. My percentage of becoming an alcoholic and abusing, it is very great. I stick to the. The fruit fruit. The fruit is over, you hide it. And it's only usually, when i'm I have social. When i'm out I do do actually have apple announced but it's again for social events. And even then it's not like. You know. I drink a lot say no."
705.0,Provider,"It sounds like then Dominique that you haven't had an issue with with alcohol at your you're very aware, where it could lead and so you're very mindful, on occasion, you have a drink. And again, sometimes people ask me well, if I have a drink at home alone, does that mean that I have an alcohol use disorder and it's like no that doesn't necessarily mean. That you you do, but in the event, you know that you start drinking more alone and it gets to be from two to four then there's there's something else you know to to talk about. I see to on here, no other substances doesn't look like any any a past of that and no prior military service. i'm going to switch gears here, no nicotine products, no tobacco products baby or anything yeah. gambling. Any concerns with gambling."
15561.0,Patient,Know i'm so we.
705.0,Provider,know.
15561.0,Patient,i'm already concerned about making sure I have enough to cover the bills and whatever the things my kid needs me to into gamble. Unless I don't have to put up my own money and it's automatically i'm going to win actually there that's a possibility.
705.0,Provider,"And that's different. yeah yeah but nothing that's problematic where you're running off to the casino and OK. For daily activity so living with grooming and hygiene like showering brushing your teeth, do you need any assistance, no assistance some assistance."
15561.0,Patient,No assistance or.
705.0,Provider,Any previous medical hospitalizations.
15561.0,Patient,Just do normal giving birth and. i've had a couple of Malaysians other than that no.
705.0,Provider,"um any like traumatic brain injury or concussions. Okay, any concerns with eating disorder like withholding food or binge eating or anything like that."
15561.0,Patient,"No. I just know that my appetite. it's just like kinda not there. And I guess I could say like. In the beginning of the year. So musically I say usually around. 210 to 12 and I went down to about 190. i'm just really getting that weight back and then. But I still you know man just kind of go out today. You need to eat something. And for me that's been really kind of hard. Because I feel like. Nothing.

Once you get back into sleep routine you have medication to help you fall asleep maintain it and then you get back into that then maybe you wouldn't need asleep mad. Or maybe you know something like that, so it could could shift, but the more that you're able to share with Mary tester of what's going on.

705.0,Provider,"You know, a mentally take a toll to where then you're more irritated your you know annoyed at stuff little things become bake things because you're just not feeling good and you're feeling exhausted. So being able to you know take all the different aspects and be like Okay, how do we get that balance, and so this is, you know part of. The journey here with by heart health is finding where what's going to work for you and making it to you're going to hear a lot of different coping skills they can group, people will share different. Things that work for them and that's great and that's how we learn sometimes it's also sometimes you rule it out. You may just try and go, you know what that doesn't work for. me or make it your style you know if something doesn't feel like we do a coping skill, but it doesn't quite match up. Make it something that. Then does so i'm hopeful dominic that you'll be able to find some of those things. I wanted to see to what we do is a suicide assessment to has there ever been like any times that you've experienced thoughts of hurting yourself or harming yourself."

Please do not sit on that I want you to share and say something, because, in the event we're going to we call it the safety plan of what some of the things you can do, but. You know, even if you and I are getting me and we're going to talk, but you have something come up where you feel like you want to harm yourself. call very hard health if it's an emergency call 911 and then 2988 is now the Suicide Prevention hotline you don't even have to call like the old 811 800 number, you can just call 988. And there's also to to have on hand. it's a text crisis line and it's not specifically for suicide, have you heard of the 741741."
15561.0,Patient,"No, I don't. think so. yeah. I don't know if it's along in the line. With the hotline."

So on now it. doesn't look like any, then, can you tell me a couple of reasons why you believe life is worth living."
15561.0,Patient,"that's. A hard question. Because. Maybe you know with my own face of my. rabbit this month times in the lighting disappearing. Because I feel like. I do a lot of things, but I don't. So I can't say like I feel like I should. Because. But it's like so, then I live. My children. And their primary."

A lot of times, people will put out there, because you can chat you can do a chat well you already know, some. You can put in the chat and, as you know, not to everyone, if you don't want everyone to have like. Your email or your phone number, but if you if you do I mean sometimes people do that, and then it just gives you one more resource, or you know, maybe part of it is finding other things outside of a family of people that. can relate and can be like Okay, you know we're here for one another and it's at a different level because we're family sometimes they they love you, but sometimes it can get messy because you have Ministry."
15561.0,Patient,"Now, and I know that's. A new she's she's trying to like quite understand and. You know this this gentleman's.

Where then you're like you know what i'm not alone i'm not the only with it feels like this i'm not the only one that yearns for this or that, and you know it's.

Like when you go and I meet. check in that way to like after the first time, you and I are going to meet they're going to give you well, like today, you receive the meeting link. And they probably gave you 679815777 as your zoom number. huh."

705.0,Provider,that's okay.
15561.0,Patient,Another person that it was more like in like a breakout room. Right and then then that person was able to give me a link to click here to wait for you.
705.0,Provider,"With the link to get too many Dominique it's going to stay the same, which would be. The 679-811-5777 and that's my zoom room when when you and I need."

705.0,Provider,"Maybe so. So when you click next time dominate because you can do the same thing check into the virtual Center and then though they will probably then give you the link and then that link, you can just reuse when you meet with me. And then we can start you then after that, with that 415458 to 688 is where you would text and you would. say you know checking in. And then you know if they need you to come to the virtual Center then tell you come to the virtual Center. But if you get needed saying it just tells them that. going to your individual session. So it could be a shortcut in the future."
15561.0,Patient,Okay yeah cuz I didn't use they just go through the virtual. yeah This is all so new to me.
705.0,Provider,"It will take like anything else you'll be a pro at it probably by the end of the week you'll be like oh virtual Center I know.
