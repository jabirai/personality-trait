759.0,Provider,i'm glad you're here.
15625.0,Patient,me too.
759.0,Provider,So what's been up.
15625.0,Patient,"Well, I. What has been up let's see. i'm nothing crazy I don't think I think I I really want to work on a vision board for this year. Okay, and like some like lay out some actual solid goals that I want to accomplish. Because I like really just want to like make a goal to like move out of home get a steady income, you know and be financially independent. Those are the main goals you know."
759.0,Provider,"that's our main goals okay so move out be financially, you know independent okay."
15625.0,Patient,mm hmm.
759.0,Provider,Have a steady income okay.
15625.0,Patient,"yeah, and so I think I just need to like. start working towards that and everything and find like. yeah."
759.0,Provider,"sounds good, to me, so the question is normally direct question is how do we get there."
15625.0,Patient,You know.
759.0,Provider,"that's in between, you know getting what you want, you know."
15625.0,Patient,"yeah and I feel like i've gotten myself stuck in this bad like thought pattern. Since this summer we're like it started out with like I was really depressed this summer so, then I was like I can't do this right now, like I don't have the capacity to like work towards a career, right now, I just have to focus on my mental health and get better. yeah and then, so I like push that off and then, once I got better mentally I was like oh no like i'm Okay, working with my family like this is good i'll push off my own like desires for now. yeah and then, once I quit, then I was like Okay, yes, I need to work on myself, but then it was like holiday season, and I was like no one like I. it's like literally Christmas and New year's and then I got sick with coven and I, these are expenses, but yeah I got sick with coven right after new year's. So I was sick for like a week it wasn't too bad. But then I was because I was really like Okay, yes, when the new year starts i'm going to hit the ground running. And i'm going to have all my goals and everything. And then I was like waiting to feel better. And now i'm feeling better. And i'm ready to do it, but I just want to like make sure I don't. come up with some random excuse again to like push it back. And I think a lot of that. is just from my fear of failure but also my sense of like perfectionism. mm hmm and I feel like if i'm really going for it now like, I have to do it right, I have to get the right position and the right job and like do it as best as I can but like that pressure is just stopping me from even trying it all right now."
759.0,Provider,"i'm kind of like that that person kind of like that pressure that you feel like I gotta get all this done and it might seem overwhelming a little bit. yeah overthinking some things yeah so just bring him back to kind of like what's the first step. You know, like so I don't get overwhelmed least I have a plan in place, you know, in terms of me reach my goal, you know, like, even though it might seem a little scary or overwhelming you know you can reach the end goal."
15625.0,Patient,mm hmm yeah.
759.0,Provider,yeah so it sounds like you've been stuck in this pattern of you know overthinking and yeah you can overcome that.
15625.0,Patient,Do you have any like. Action item tips for me for like how to.
759.0,Provider,"yeah I do yeah to compact that I think putting things into perspective, a little bit of soft top just knowing because your dogs do matter in terms of how you feel like your thoughts can control, like the things that you do and what you think about yourself. So you know noticing what the.is and just say that it's just a thought. You know by my fear of failure it's just a thought you know I know i'm capable I just got done with doing the four year degree, I know I really capable of everything down want to work towards. And you know, like so just remind yourself that you're I think a little bit of affirmations to I don't know if we talked about affirmations like I can do. yeah I you know, like the little bit of you know, like affirmations go like a long way, like I believe in myself, you know different things of that nature. And I think, combined with knowing that your thoughts are just thoughts, you know it doesn't make them true you know, like I know it's kind of cheesy and those kinds of things that you might think us therapists say but it's true. It really is true your thoughts are just thoughts. So. You know, like and you don't have to you know it's just a thought just popped in my head like I can choose not to believe it. And then affirmations to. yeah yeah. Okay, that sounds like doable for you."
15625.0,Patient,"All right, can I does."
759.0,Provider,"You know, if you want me to, but I think those two ones work, the best."
15625.0,Patient,"yeah I want to write those down i'm thinking, maybe I could add some affirmations to my vision board."
759.0,Provider,"So you can. Definitely can. yeah so you know, like, I know, last time we talked we talked about different goals as you work in the entertainment industry, and you know you wind, to really seek out a career, maybe in acting and that you want to. Let me shut up so you can write down why just said."
15625.0,Patient,"So, no, no you're done."
759.0,Provider,Good. yeah so I know those are things that you want to do like you want to move down here to La area right. mm hmm yeah be closer to Hollywood you know i'm actually not that far from Hollywood actually. cool I didn't realize I live. I live in burbank so it's kind of media Center yeah. yeah so you want to fight down this way you know what you'd be really good for you.
15625.0,Patient,"yeah and I like. It just seems like it's so far away, in some ways, but so close. And like it seems like so easy it's like get a job find an apartment. Right, but I also i'm just like."
759.0,Provider,it's not easy. Because you got it. yeah yeah and first you got to find a job you got to go through interviews together break down what jobs to apply for you know it's a long process.
15625.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,"me let's tighten up the goal little bit just something. Simple Okay, instead of yeah The goal is, I want to find employment, but the goal also should be the short term goal should be how do I look for. Employment them i'm going to search daily for a job or weekly or a couple times a week i'm going to search for jobs and actually applied to them, so does that make sense for us to kind of break down the goal to at least you know. yeah four times a week i'm gonna do a job search and apply for jobs."
15625.0,Patient,I think that is a great so it's not nearly as daunting. yeah.
759.0,Provider,"yeah I think that'd be good, you know, and you know, once you get a job you know interviewing you know, like how many interviews you want to have a week to like if you do get you know well you're going to get calls back and things like that that's what we hope for. But yeah you know, like. And how the interview, then you know, maybe getting getting some tips I interviewing you know going on, are you on login."
15625.0,Patient,Right yeah.
759.0,Provider,"Okay, so I know they have like a lot of resources of how to interview, you know that's if you need that help i'm just thinking out loud in terms of what you know useful so maybe looking at interview tips."
15625.0,Patient,yeah definitely.
759.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah and then you know what types of jobs, are you looking for."
15625.0,Patient,"yeah That is another thing that I gotta like narrow down, I have an idea of like what I want."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15625.0,Patient,"I think it's hard because it's just like. there's so much of that industry, I still don't know yet, and I feel like not until i'm working in it will I like understand. which jobs are like really right for me, or like what positions you know. But yeah I need to get going on that. I think."
759.0,Provider,"In some jobs, I know just a little bit because my brother's a filmmaker but he's a filmmaker and toss in South Carolina. But I do know they have these jobs, I think his project assistant or PA jobs were. yeah you know, like you can go work on like a found and basically you're like this sustained getting you know doing things like you know fixing problems are taking them down driving getting food, but it's a good way for you to be on set you know and. yeah just training that you can do to become a PA you know so maybe looking up something like that to."
15625.0,Patient,"yeah I know that was like exactly the position I expected I would start out in you know. Okay, because it's like cuz my main things are like I really want to be working on set. And well that's like basically, the main thing for now like i'm not expecting to have any high paying position to them just starting out. You know. But just something that has like a lot of room for growth and something that will be able to like learn a lot from the entire process. Like through that position. And that seems like and."
759.0,Provider,You can network to. You know yeah absolute positions to.
15625.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I realized like that is so, the big thing. is like networking and so i've been trying to do that, but it's also hard, because I. feel like everyone that I know is in the same position as me trying to like get a job you know."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15625.0,Patient,Like all recent college grads.
759.0,Provider,"yeah well, they say that the job market that's hot right now, you know a lot of people are leaving your job if you're not working, you know so hopefully you find that you know to be your case. You know yeah where do you currently live right now."
15625.0,Patient,"glendora, which is about an hour from La."
759.0,Provider,"la okay that's not too bad it's not like your first I thought you were in like normally I don't know why you're in northern California, but Glenn doors also. know just pull over there, oh cuz you go over there okay."
15625.0,Patient,uh huh. yeah. yeah I know I really need to take advantage of being that close and doing that. yeah do you want to switch topics to something we're juicy.
759.0,Provider,sure we get.
15625.0,Patient,All right. let's talk about boys.
759.0,Provider,"Okay, I forgot their names already I haven't talked to talking to you and the way I forgot to names."
15625.0,Patient,"Jared is the ex boyfriend that I dated past year. And we started talking again I don't know if I told you about that. yeah yes, I did tell you about that. And then. yeah and I realized like. I really did miss having in my life, having him in my life, but I realized that, like every time we hung out we hung out probably like four times. You know, but every time it was either like I was staying with him for the weekend in San Diego or he was staying with me for the weekend in La. So they were like long hangouts you know, and I just. realized more and more how like incompatible, we are. i'm like enjoying it less. Every time because i'm just realizing more and more that like we just don't mesh together, as well as I thought. yeah I think a lot of that is because, like. We dated during quarantine like during coven you know so like and we were. We were like we were just like on in college and like we would be able to see. each other all the time and, like we were never in social situations together, because I, there was nothing going on. mm hmm and I think like now that we're able to go to like social situations and like hang out with a lot of other people and go to group settings i'm realizing like we're just so different. yeah like. yeah so we haven't the last time we hung out didn't go very well, I mean. We had an argument about like. It was like well, it was about like a sex thing but anyway. And I just but I hated the way he handled it like this, the original issue itself wasn't like that big of a deal to make me mad, so the way that he handled it felt so selfish like he wasn't able to at all see where I was coming from. which I feel like used to be way better. at that."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15625.0,Patient,"or not, or maybe just better. Not way better but. yeah and then after that I was kind of just like you know what in my head, I was like you know what one of the only great things about this relationship left was the sex and now even that is fucked up. So what am I doing here."
759.0,Provider,yeah exactly yeah.
15625.0,Patient,"yeah so then he left and we haven't that was like right after Christmas and the only time we've talked since then was like. A week and a half ago. When he asked me if he left something here and I was like no. I don't see it Happy New Year. Happy New Year. And we haven't talked since then. which I think is good. Because I think I was definitely looking at the relationship with like. rose tinted glasses, you know, and I like was romanticizing it a lot, because he was like the first person I ever loved and blah blah blah, and I think I needed that bad experience to remind me that, like. I don't think we like work well together and like and he doesn't have all the qualities that I want in a long term relationship anyway, you know. yeah so i'm back to being on the single train."
759.0,Provider,"single train Gaz is the place, you can choose to or two to tutor."
15625.0,Patient,"i've missed here I mean. i've been here for like six months, but now i'm like. yeah i'm good. You know, just like. I think part of me is just losing hope that i'm ever going to find a guy that like lives up to my standard because, like not to be cocky but, like, I really am better than all the men, I mean like they don't have basic compassion. or there so selfish like. The patriarchy just ruins every man, by making him think the world revolves around them. yeah and that they can get whatever they want like it's so bullshit i'm like. You need to live your life as a woman for like one week and you'll learn how to treat people better. So."
759.0,Provider,frustrating right.
15625.0,Patient,It is frustrating.
759.0,Provider,"And I agree, you know, like you had your suspicions that this relationship with Jared wasn't going to go well because of what happened from before so. kind of prove kind of true that you guys weren't so compatible, as you, you, you know thought, maybe rekindling this kind of friendship or relationship would be you know, but you have good instincts you know there yeah."
15625.0,Patient,"And then, with the other guy Joe."
759.0,Provider,Joe go okay.
15625.0,Patient,"yeah he was the one that I dated in high school, very briefly, and we become friends again. This summer, like we were kind of on and off friends during college, but we became a lot closer this summer, because I like friend group started hanging out like all the time, and he was the one that confessed his love for me and I was like oh my God, I just want to be friends. And he kept confessing his love for me kept trying to like asked me out and stuff. And I like. I think I told him like. It must have been like four times now i've told him, like, I just want to be friends, I don't see you that way, and everything because, like. I think I think in his head he thought that I just like hadn't been able to forgive him for like the stuff that he did in high school. yeah but it's just that, like I just like really don't see him like that at all anymore like romantically you know, and so I think he was like trying these past few months to like prove himself to me. So I was like. No like I I constant like I literally I felt guilty at first cuz i'm like Am I leading him on but i'm like no I literally every time he is like done this i've always shot him down or like tried to be honest with him. yeah it's not like i'm flirting with him or like trying to play mind games, or whatever i'm like he really just has not been he just keeps trying, you know. And so, about a week ago. He told me like again that he really wants to try again and he he's changed, and all this stuff and I told him like I really do just see you Platonic Lee like I don't think like it's not going to happen it's not about anything that you did I just don't see it. Because I was like clearly I need to be more clear about this, I was like I didn't and i'm like I love the way that you're acting now I feel like you're way more mature and all this stuff and and I appreciate how our friendship is grown. But. it's gonna be a no for me dog. yeah and then I thought it was good, I was like hell yeah if your weight lifted off my shoulder. And then the next time we hung out. He was like. We were like sitting next to each other. mm hmm but, like in separate chairs, like in like like outdoor furniture, or whatever it. doesn't matter so like. And he just kept like. Like putting his hand on my leg, or like trying to hold my hand. And all this and, like our other friend was there, and so I didn't want to embarrass him by being like stop like. I need to learn to be more mean to men because, like, I did not want that happening, and he just like kept touching my leg. The entire time and I was like trying to subtly hint that I didn't like I would like turn my legs, the other direction, so. routine is easily. Oh, and this is kind of funny he would like try to put like if your legs like this, you know, he would try to like put his hand in there, and my knees."
759.0,Provider,I was like.
15625.0,Patient,"Well, maybe like that. So I clamp my legs closed, and I was just like. But it still wouldn't get the message and I was like Oh, what the heck. yeah and so after that I realized, I was like really frustrated with him, and that was the first time I was actually like pretty mad at him. Because I felt like he wasn't respecting my boundaries yeah."
759.0,Provider,Your boundary yeah.
15625.0,Patient,"yeah, and so I like talk to him about that, after and I was like listen, I told you like multiple times, I just want to be friends, I don't want like. If you wouldn't be touching our other friends like that I don't want you treating me like that, and like. You either need to like learn to stop or we need to not hang out with each other, until you can treat me like a friend and not like try to pursue me like that and that went really well so. Good he hasn't tried anything, since that and he was like. yeah i'm sorry."
759.0,Provider,"Yes, sometimes you just have to be direct as possible and you're trying to put out hints and he just wasn't getting that. You know, but i'm glad that you're able to tell him that you know don't know on the relationship yes you're not going to be together, and you, you know, putting that out there and letting him know that you know. I don't know what was out with the next time that he was trying still trying to put his hands on you, I don't know what he was thinking."
15625.0,Patient,What the hell.
759.0,Provider,yeah but he tried to shut it down again so good.
15625.0,Patient,yeah I think it's something I definitely need to work on is like learning to be more mean two boys that deserve it.
759.0,Provider,That deserve it.
15625.0,Patient,"Like I realized like in those situations. I always think of, like the other person first. Because i'm like I want to tell them to stop yeah like. Oh, I don't want to hurt their feelings I don't want to embarrass them in front of these. Other people. yeah like in all honesty, like Fuck that like they're not respecting my feelings like, not that I should deliberately be mean but I need to be okay with being mean in order to do what's best for me, you know. So that's my challenge to myself is do what I want without even thinking about what they want, first, you know."
759.0,Provider,I think sometimes you just have to do that right. yeah yeah which is it good boundary to have you know with men in general.
15625.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,"yeah. very nice less well sounds like. You know, like you, are are should I call you call you Celeste right. yeah Okay, I was thinking about your first name, but I was just like I think it's Celeste. We can remember, but yeah you know, like in terms of boys being mean towards them, I think, just being direct and clear what your boundaries expectations are and just remain maintaining that like they don't have to. You know, like yeah new affiliates might get her but you're protecting yourself. you're not. putting up a little bit of a barrier which is okay. yeah. Definitely that."
15625.0,Patient,i'm trying to think if there's anything else i've been wanting to talk to you about. Like. I don't know.
759.0,Provider,I can just been chillin.
15625.0,Patient,"yeah really. The world has not testing me lately, which is a good thing right."
759.0,Provider,"yeah, which is good, you know so you're right now you're not working right."
15625.0,Patient,No i'm not working right now.
759.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'm not working, so how you occupying your time these days."
15625.0,Patient,"Oh that's another thing. social media. But I deleted it a few days ago, like all of them."
759.0,Provider,"Oh, you deleted, all of them wow."
15625.0,Patient,"Like tick tock instagram and read it. And i'm challenging myself to go on a social media cleanse fully. For the next, or at least off of my phone if someone else shows me means i'm okay with that. But i'm not allowed to look them up on my phone you know. And I want to do that at least till the end of this month. And i'm hoping that once I get a few weeks off of it and I learned how to entertain myself again like. Without phone i'll be good, because i've realized I have like this terrible addiction to like look to my phone for entertainment, like the second I stopped being occupied with something. Like the second i'm done doing anything I just automatically go to my phone and i'm just like all right, and today me i'm not doing anything right now. And I never. Like I literally never had this problem until this year. Because I was so like busy usually like in high school and college like I had so much going on, I didn't have time for a."
759.0,Provider,"social media and addiction, you know."
15625.0,Patient,"And so I want to like get back to that point, so I need to take a cleanse and then i'm hoping. My goal for this year is just to be busy busy busy, I want to be making money, I want to be working, I want to be doing different investments, I want to be hanging out with my friends, I want to be so busy that I literally don't even have any time to myself. Because that's when i'm my happiest you know, is when i'm busy and and I think, naturally, when I get to that point i'm also just not gonna let my phone and social media Apps such a hold over me either. yeah."
759.0,Provider,"I think that's a good thing, learning how to entertain yourself, I think, even suggested doing like puzzles you know. You know, watching maybe shows you know or just something that you know that are reading a book are."
15625.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,"You know, maybe going out somewhere, you know going to a Park, or you know just walking around just something else that can you know, can you get back to your hobbies your hobbies you know so yeah thinking about what your hobbies are with things that you like to do."
15625.0,Patient,"yeah and so. yeah, that is the goal like I really want to just. be able to live in the moment more and. be more present you know and like actually just have more diverse hobbies instead of just spending hours on my phone number at board."
759.0,Provider,"And that's going to help with your anxiety also. yeah it's going to help with being more present you know and being more aware of what's going on, instead of like being pulled into social media, and you know that's gonna help you a lot."
15625.0,Patient,uh huh and I like.
759.0,Provider,where'd you go.
15625.0,Patient,"I can't see you i'm sorry. my sister keeps calling me, so I just need to text her that i'm in therapy."
759.0,Provider,Okay.
15625.0,Patient,"i'm okay. I just texted her therapy so. that's good but yeah. I also noticed, and this was also something that I was not very like this is a new issue, I never thought i'd have this issue."
759.0,Provider,But.
15625.0,Patient,"I noticed that I have been like comparing myself so much to these girls on instagram now and, like. Like specifically my face i'm like i'm not hot enough, I need botox I need another nose job I need all this some and i'm just like oh my God, this is so bad, this is not me like I. I think that's another reason I really need to do this cleanse is because i've like actually started comparing myself to complete strangers that probably photoshop their faces. And like in I know so much of it is fake so much of it is amazing makeup so much of it is just genetics, which I just don't have their genetics and like I know there's like a million people that are actually so much prettier than me. And that never used to bother me before because I used to always just want to like elevate my own attractiveness. yeah without comparing it to anyone else's which I think is like healthy or like I don't think I did it to an unhealthy extent you know. mm hmm and. yeah I needed to stop doing that, like okay after I got my nose job I was so happy with it and so excited and everything and then I kept seeing all these girls online that had even smaller noses than this knows. This new one. And i'm like oh my God, I was like it's not small enough it's not good enough and i'm just like what am I doing like this is never the goal was never to have a tiny nose, like everyone else, the goal was just to like. Fishing rosalie out yeah. So. it's hard, because I like now the second I see anyone elses faces I just immediately noticed their nose. And like I I didn't even do that, even when I had a big nose insecurity like it was interesting because, like I would never even notice other people's noses. Like ever like I was not detail oriented it was never like a comparing my nose to other people, it was always just like a, I would like to change this and this about my nose, you know. So I don't really like how i've started comparing so much I think it's a really unhealthy and I don't like I just wanted to stop."
759.0,Provider,"yeah like campaign your you know gnosis to other people and comparing yourself to other people, you know comparison can be the joy, do you know, like. Which is. yeah people share but it's true, it has some truth to it, you know. um you know, like in terms of how you feel about yourself, you know, like you want to have a healthy sense of self, and you know, like I like what you said, like always start you know I want to. You know, build my own attractiveness, you know, like make myself, you know feel better look better whatever how from one to do that. But it just goes back to self talk, you know, like you know i'm good enough, you know just you know, the way that I look, you know, like and that can be tough to because. social media is definitely the place where are unrealistic bd standards also live in social media in in terms of you know, like you, can't help it, but this is like. The face that you were born with you know, like we can't change the face that we were born with and so many people well, we can make all you know alterations but not you change. You know, but some people they do you know spend a lot of money on their faces to make it, you know, like look there's a certain type of way and sometimes we have to realize that to like even girls your youngest you get botox i'm like what they want. At botox."
15625.0,Patient,it's.
759.0,Provider,"crazy it's crazy, and so I think just going back to kind of like i'm beautiful, you know, in my own way and just you know rehearsing some of that you know good self, talk, you know self esteem talk. About yeah but yeah like I think a lot of people struggle, you know with the unrealistic beauty standards are out there, you know and like you say you never know the person is photoshopping are you know, like through lugs or it could be numbered different things."
15625.0,Patient,"yeah and what's interesting on a good note. Is I feel like. Now I don't know when this change happened, whether it was like a year ago, or whenever, but like now, I feel so much more confident in my body."
759.0,Provider,Which is.
