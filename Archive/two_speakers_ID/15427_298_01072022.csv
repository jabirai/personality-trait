15427.0,Patient,Hello.
298.0,Provider,"Thank you, how can I help you."
15427.0,Patient,"yeah i'm. I need to do a medical. review, I guess, I. Know sorry i'm a little bit critical and maybe the flu."
298.0,Provider,"Okay i'm going to pull up your email, I remember you wrote me but I can't remember what it was about so i'm holding it up prescription re evaluation."
15427.0,Patient,"yeah I think we were going to stay on the risperidone and the current prescriptions for some period of time to see if this helps and then but it doesn't seem to be helping in terms of. Hearing voices and stuff so. I was wondering. You know what we should, where we should go from here at the current prescription."
298.0,Provider,yeah i'm looking at i'm thinking right now. So when you were at six milligrams a day we went from six milligrams down to two milligrams with of risperidone when you were at six milligrams did you hear voices.
15427.0,Patient,yeah but. yeah I heard voices.
298.0,Provider,and How long have you been hearing voices.
15427.0,Patient,"i'm. Actively pretty actively for about a year now. But the kind of started. Like four years ago, maybe. For a couple days. within a couple of days. And then I didn't really hear him. You know, for quite a while now."
298.0,Provider,"So here's the rule of thumb that they basically say is that putting a person on to anti-psychotics does not necessarily mean that it will be helpful. And so I mean we could try, but the more times that the more anti-psychotics you're on the higher the risk of. Side effects to medications which is a bummer. yeah and you're saying that the risperidone at higher levels did it make the voices quieter."
15427.0,Patient,No.
298.0,Provider,"No, are these voices telling you to do. terrible things."
15427.0,Patient,"Sometimes, but I don't want to."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, good good um. And what other anti-psychotics have you tried in the past."
15427.0,Patient,Except for what you believe. I believe.
298.0,Provider,"What I would like to try, but it's, not to say that it would work, but I would like to see if it quiets the voices down is to go up on the seroquel and see if we can get the voices to come down that way, the risperidone I think we should leave it alone are you taking the propranolol."
15427.0,Patient,yeah i'm taking everything.
298.0,Provider,"OK, so the seroquel has the potential for quiet invoices but you're the one who said enough to let me know if it actually works. and"
15427.0,Patient,Let me.
298.0,Provider,say that again.
15427.0,Patient,it's only for nighttime.
298.0,Provider,"yeah that's only for nighttime. At first we're going to try just 300 milligrams we can go as high as 700 milligrams to quiet, the voices but um let's see what $300 300. milligram stuff I don't want to go on the risperidone because, if you remember with the higher you go on risperidone The more that it flattens you like you feel like a zombie that. So I would rather give you something at nighttime when you're sleeping to see if it can cover you in the daytime. Okay, does that make sense."
15427.0,Patient,yeah it does.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, and then let me know what you know, let me know what you're feeling if it's helping at all after a few days. Okay Okay, thank you for coming to see me."
15427.0,Patient,yep Thank you.
298.0,Provider,Take care bye bye.
