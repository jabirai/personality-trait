ID,Role,Message

12556.0,Patient,"i'm Okay, how are you."
748.0,Provider,i'm good i'm looking forward to getting to know you.
12556.0,Patient,Oh yeah same here.
748.0,Provider,"Good so. One of the things that I tend to do is I like to get to know you by you telling me who you are rather than me reading something about who you are. And so I am coming in, not knowing anything. So. um would you like to start, and what history, would you like me to know."
12556.0,Patient,um. you're my second therapist ever i'm Tara was my first therapist.
748.0,Provider,Tara was your first okay.
12556.0,Patient,"um I started therapy this year. I think it was in June. May or June, which is when I got Zola my cat. rescued her from our parking structure downstairs."
748.0,Provider,I remember that from show and tell.
12556.0,Patient,"yeah she's my first cat. um I have, I have two dogs i'm generally a dog person. and zilla has taught me a new love. Which is pretty amazing. About myself. I. i've discovered this year with work. With shauntel and Tara that. I have ADHD it's pretty bad i've always had it i'm learning, this has given me a lot of answers. I don't think shauntel has made an official diagnosis, but um. i've started taking medication for it, I take adderall for it."
748.0,Provider,Oh.
12556.0,Patient,"yeah. I have a very weird complex about medications taking medications. there's a lot of shame and weirdness that. That I learned from my mom about medication taking medication. So i'm struggling with that. The ADHD. explains, a lot of. How I am who I am I don't I don't know what the right. Turn only geez. I think i'm."
748.0,Provider,Probably both.
12556.0,Patient,And I have a lot of really. Severe emotional dysregulation I cry easily. I used to get upset really easily and I thought I had.
748.0,Provider,Between crying really easily and being upset really.
12556.0,Patient,"um I used to be quick to anger. um. And I started taking cymbalta a few years ago. Actually, for nerve pain. Because. I have. A herniated disc in my my spine close to my neck. The cymbalta doesn't really help with the nerve pain, but it's helped a lot with my. anxiety. But since I started taking adderall. That complex kicks in that medication complex and then I started tapering down on my cymbalta. And now i'm off of it. And so the only medication that I take, for you know mental health is the adderall. and are still at the first dosage that Chatel has prescribed me."
748.0,Provider,And how is not anxiety.
12556.0,Patient,"And the anxiety is much more manageable. Now that you know i've addressed. i've put a name and a face to you know my mental health issues that ADHD i'm able to recognize like Okay, this is what you now know as emotional dysregulation you know, like you feel very strongly, because you can't help it i'm. um. I was abused as a kid."
748.0,Provider,and
12556.0,Patient,"physically emotionally mentally verbally Okay, and is all my mother and. My father work all the time. When my mom wasn't taking us or picking us up from school she worked with my dad so her schedule is very flexible. My parents owned an auto repair shop. And so, he. He was our sole provider pretty much and she did the books. He wasn't there for most of the abuse, because. She was always at work, but when he was there and. Nobody stepped in nobody said anything."
748.0,Provider,So he didn't protect you from the abuse.
12556.0,Patient,"No i'm. Another thing i've learned is here is my mother's and nurses and. i've looked into, you know. I guess now that I started therapy it's opened up a curiosity about. Mental health and. So I do a lot of work off of. You know when i'm not in therapy. I do a lot of my own. Reading and research."
748.0,Provider,What are you reading.
12556.0,Patient,And the body keeps the score.
748.0,Provider,vessel.
12556.0,Patient,"i'm not. reading it, I listen through the audio book. is very difficult for me to sit down and you know read um. I wanted you to know that i'm I play with fidget toys during my sessions all the time i'm not looking at my phone or being disrespectful I just."
748.0,Provider,"don't I think that's brilliant that you take care of yourself. And it, it is helpful when you're bringing up so much intense information. To be able to have something to do with your hands. Absolutely, because I can feel how painful, this is for you."
12556.0,Patient,Thank you chrissy so.
748.0,Provider,"And you know, one of the things that you. said earlier, was that you didn't write the words down, but I think the word you used was dis regulated. And I don't know that at all what I hear is that you were traumatized for years. And that you're still carrying. On rain. And if your mom was a narcissist and your dad didn't intervene i'm guessing that you were told and and made you feel as you're walking through was no big deal. And that it was your own fault. So you're finally being present to how untrue that once."
12556.0,Patient,"i'm. A little brother he's six years younger. He lives in. Pennsylvania, with his wife he's a doctor. In the air force. He went to Stanford. um. I went to usc for two years and I never finished I got kicked out because. A lot of things. But I can see now it's because I didn't address my mental health issues. um. I don't know if you've heard in the news, it was in the news. For a little bit. But there was a doctor. When are we going to usc. And he. violated, a lot of decisions. And I was one of his patients."
748.0,Provider,"Say violated i'm. I don't want to make an assumption, but i'm hearing."
12556.0,Patient,"Sexual actually the sexually violated them as I don't i'm. I have. I have a really core memory. In general I don't remember a lot of. it's hard for me to remember a lot. um. I have a friend from college who you know his I guess curse is that he remembers everything. You know and we've been friends. Often, on all the time, because he. remembers everything and. I always forget everything so. You know if we haven't talked in a while. And we reconnect i'll be like Oh, you know why. don't you keep in touch and then you know he'll be like you don't remember you are upset about this with me. it's not just the. usc incident that. I can't remember. Everything um. I didn't even remember it happened until a couple years ago when I got a packet in the mail from these lawyers and they. They said, you know our record records show that you were this person patient. And you, you may have suffered. abuse at his hands so um. If you can remember and write it down. You can get a settlement. And um. I. I didn't even recognize his name, when it was in the news before I got the Pack. And then. I couldn't fill out the packet because. I couldn't honestly fate, you know. They asked. They were like you know, please answer the best you can and any answer is, you know acceptable but. i'm not employed right now my husband supports the both of us."
748.0,Provider,"What you. Just did. You just heard such intense information I don't want you, moving on to more facts and details this worst survey."
12556.0,Patient,Okay.
748.0,Provider,After that is so painful.
12556.0,Patient,The packet I didn't I didn't send it back because I can't remember.
748.0,Provider,But you said you started to remember.
12556.0,Patient,"receiving the packet triggered. yeah that but. I still can't. Remember, you know going. I just know that when I went to college. things happen, and then I started spiraling and then I stopped going to classes, they stopped. caring about grades. i'm."
748.0,Provider,"i'm i'm not sure that that isn't enough. information. Because i'm just going to ask you, when your mom would have us you do you remember that."
12556.0,Patient,Only some only some incidents. Only sometimes.
748.0,Provider,been reading the body keeps the score.
12556.0,Patient,yeah it's I haven't finished it.
748.0,Provider,"You don't need to finish it, I mean certainly that may be something you want to do, but. Reading that in in digesting the depth of that information and the incredible capacity as human beings that we have to learn coping mechanisms, you know down. read or heard in the audio. For them, that we learn how to leave our body. When we're being abused it's a self protection. You learned how to do."
12556.0,Patient,usc still ended up sending me. checks. Even though I didn't respond. I call them rape check because. it's like getting paid for it and I hate it.
748.0,Provider,can never give you back your innocence or you're saying.
12556.0,Patient,So sorry it's like so her first day.
748.0,Provider,"Please don't apologize, I feel so deeply deeply privileged to be pressing. And i'm so grateful that you're."
12556.0,Patient,"Have you seen. or heard of the show I may destroy you. I heard about it. A while ago, and then. The synopsis is basically a young woman she she gets. assaulted violated. and She can't remember what happened to her when she wakes up. I was listening to a renee brown podcast and renee had. recommended this show. And so you know, in preparation for. me and tara's last. Appointment I benched the show, even though. It was so difficult I wasn't ready, it took me three days to finish the first episode. It was so hard but um it was really validating because I saw another woman. Also, not remember. and The woman who wrote. And created this show she was writing about she was taking from her own experiences so some of it is. based on true life. And it was really hard to see the people at her world desolate her not on purpose, you know, but just because. They don't care to look, which is not their fault, but it is really validating. That. Because, sometimes I don't believe myself yes. Because you know, can you remember it no I can't. Did it really happen, can you say for sure no I can't."
748.0,Provider,"Imagine that on top of. On top of having that very. clear answer which is. Painful in and of itself, there is another part, that is. you're probably your mother telling you that if you don't remember you're lying or. mother's voice I don't mean she's actually said word. For. So there's it's. there's a woman, I also like I love her neighbor him but her name is Tara Brock and. Okay G is a bonus psychologist and. meditation teacher and and just phenomenal and she talks about. The first arrow is the set whatever it is that is causing us pain it's it's both the combination of memory that you don't actually have but knowing on the three from. From the school and your own body saying yes, this happened. That you walked through that experience and then the second arrow is the way that we shame ourselves the way that we blame ourselves the way that we say you don't even know this is true, it probably didn't happen and you're making it up and that's what cripples us. that's what."
12556.0,Patient,Really keeps us.
748.0,Provider,stuck in not being able to move forward and say this did happen and i'm going to grieve it and own IT and feel it and tell the world that I was abused. i'm so sorry that happened to you.
12556.0,Patient,Thank you.
748.0,Provider,So did you I hope I didn't interrupt you did you want to talk more about I may destroy you.
12556.0,Patient,"Oh i'm. Just that one aspect of her memory loss. and When we first started Tara asked if I ever had the desire to remember. To try and recall this route. And my answer is still no. question of. You know. Other times they give me an idea. I don't I don't want to be re traumatized again. I feel like it would be traumatized me, and I can go through it again. I just want to know what it was move on."
748.0,Provider,"to know what it was, or why it was."
12556.0,Patient,I don't know probably what as well. But sometimes you don't ever find out why.
748.0,Provider,"Of course, not the Why is he was an abuser. I just. want to hear your question I. was asking you, if you wanted to know why I wanted. To I understood what you said. So you just want to know what it was."
12556.0,Patient,yeah.
748.0,Provider,got it was. What you do. Every cell in your body screaming.
12556.0,Patient,"My my dad is Buddhists. My mom is. She she changes from Buddhist to Christian to she doesn't know she doesn't she doesn't have a strong spiritual self. or identity i'm not that that's you know, a bad thing it's just that's. That wasn't ever priority for her. um. I went to an all private Christian school from. kindergarten to eighth grade very small private Christian school. They were one of those. very conservative. Christian like we didn't have school dances because dancing with the devil's work. like that. didn't. I didn't have my first kiss until college. Until I was. A freshman college. And I didn't lose my virginity till I was a sophomore in college."
748.0,Provider,And that was by choice.
12556.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I didn't really have opportunity when I was young and. I didn't have face to. I was shamed. For. any type of sexual anything. When I went to prom when I was a junior in high school my date got lost. driving back, and this is the days before you know. any type of navigation. And so we just took the wrong for you, when you got home. half hour to 45 minutes after my parents said they wanted me from. The bad night."
748.0,Provider,Oh no.
12556.0,Patient,"i'm. I haven't lived with my parents, since. My mom kept kicking me out House so um."
748.0,Provider,When you were young.
12556.0,Patient,i'm starting starting from college. i've been homeless. living out of my car mostly. I forgot why.
748.0,Provider,You started by talking about the Christian school and.
12556.0,Patient,Not oh yes. Thank you. My husband is Buddhist. um I also don't have a strong spiritual self. But I. i'm very curious and. open. And I actually have been curious about Buddhism and it's just really interesting that you brought up. A pair of Brock.
748.0,Provider,yeah. I will put her her name in the chat.
12556.0,Patient,"Oh, I googled it just know."
748.0,Provider,Okay.
12556.0,Patient,"I have yeah as soon as you said it, it was like Oh, I need to remember it I save it in my because I have a really great memory, especially short term memory. So."
748.0,Provider,"In from. You know that. You know it's not your fault it's not something you're doing it's trauma you've experienced trauma your whole. Okay, so she has wonderful weekly podcasts and and as well as a weekly meditation. So it's two different things, one is a talk for about an hour and none of it is is. Like rigidity around Buddhism, she very, very rarely even mentions the word it but that's her background and her orientation. and The meditations are very healing they're they're about gently being in your body and and and relaxing so anyway i'm glad you're going to look her up, I hope you find her a good resource."
12556.0,Patient,You meditate.
748.0,Provider,I do.
12556.0,Patient,um. Sometimes before session where. i'll get panicky and then i'll ask. Parents to just do a quick. You know breathing exercise with me. Thank you. i'm sorry to keep bringing her up she's the only experience i've ever had in therapy.
748.0,Provider,For grief and loss to.
12556.0,Patient,"I haven't had good experiences with. medical professionals, obviously. This year was my first guy to college he appointment since. college."
748.0,Provider,So.
12556.0,Patient,"i'm 39. This year, and I know how that sounds and the. Micro to colleges. she's I had never met her before but. I picked her because she worked in a. Practice That was all female. And I still had a panic attack. But she was she was so nice she was so gentle with me, she she would just you know. Clear everything with me before she did anything."
748.0,Provider,deserve to have your safety and your body perspective. i'm so glad you found something. That did that for you. that's remarkable self care. Go ahead.
12556.0,Patient,"Well, I want to mention. I would like to become. More articulate. I want to be able to better myself."
748.0,Provider,When it comes to feelings and experiences or in what way you're very articulate.
12556.0,Patient,"yeah. Just. A feeling experiences. Of. wish it wasn't so scatterbrained then. You know, when I have a conversation with somebody you just it's always. It jumps everywhere, you know and. I can see that it's it's sometimes it's hard for people to. To. conversation with me and I only noticed that because. I was conversation with a friend who also has ADHD. And she navigates our conversations so easily. You know it's such a mark different."
748.0,Provider,that she had this much traumas and you. know so let's let's identify the truth here. you're. What you called not articulate. or jumping around. is an expression of trauma it's not an expression of a village. itself way that you have learned to stay safe for. If I touch this thought and it triggers this pain. Then i'm going to ship really quick. To talk about this. That is hd.
12556.0,Patient,"Today, even when we're talking about like not things that are not to do with. Mental health."
748.0,Provider,do that.
12556.0,Patient,"yeah I do it everywhere in. Like when I when I do things in the House. i'm doing everything, at the same time, so it looks like a crazy mess. Eventually, you know it all gets sorted but. I can't focus on. One thing and then following through and finishing you know. and"
748.0,Provider,"You know. A way that I used to say it for myself was I can't pick up the sock on the floor because, if I pick up that one sock I have to repair the roof in the basement."
12556.0,Patient,yeah pretty much.
748.0,Provider,"And if I start by picking up the. sock The next thing i'll do is go wash out two dishes and then i'll think no I should go for the clothes in the laundry no I should go yeah. yeah but, but even know that looks and feels like in is a is a characteristic of of the ADHD it's also the practice that we've learned and now unconsciously do with everything that is about how to get away from the trump. How to get away. From the trump how to get away from the trump even though it's not related in the moment it's it's almost a it's a somatic representation of the emotional protection does that make sense."
12556.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
748.0,Provider,And I do want to say again you're incredibly articulate.
12556.0,Patient,Thank you.
748.0,Provider,"I have a very unrelated question but I don't want to forget to ask that, because of. Sure workmanship keeps coming up, since what you told me about the doctor has usc offered you. The capacity to complete your degree."
12556.0,Patient,kicked out because I failed out.
748.0,Provider,yeah but why.
12556.0,Patient,But. They haven't offered anything.
748.0,Provider,"What I what up, based on how you feel about the money. It seems to me that what would be fulfilling for you, even though you deserve the month. What would be fulfilling for you would be completing them to. grieve and we can talk about that a lot more lately. I later later later I don't want to shift you out of where you are too much, but I I just think that that's. that's what would probably be healing for you, because I sense a lot of shame around not finishing."
12556.0,Patient,There is a lot of shame about fitted sheet.
748.0,Provider,I bet those attorneys present that for you in a heartbeat.
12556.0,Patient,"it's over, though, like they settled and that some women they they. got their own lawyers or something and they got you know I got like a couple thousand dollars, because. I was a patient and if I had written the packet said, if you write. If you write it you're going to be compensated. You know, in the 10s or hundreds of thousands of dollars and the women who. who went off on their own and. They got. The hundred thousands of dollars and then. They dispersed the rest of the settle that. I don't know it just. I don't have the money to pay for college."
748.0,Provider,They need they need to give it to.
12556.0,Patient,You.
748.0,Provider,"I really. Like to pursue with you. And, and I honestly think that. Anyway, what I I i'm almost sorry I brought it up, but I just want you to know that it's in it's in the background in my mind as something that I think might be a very huge step for you."
12556.0,Patient,"Something that I have. thought about as well. So it's not you know it's okay that you brought it up, because you know it's not. It makes sense that you would. Consider this."
748.0,Provider,"Well, and I can I could just feel I can I could hear. The way that you hold what your brothers done. versus what you've done and the comparison that you carry with you."
12556.0,Patient,my brother wasn't abused.
748.0,Provider,I know. Like you're comparing still that you don't have your degree.
12556.0,Patient,yeah yeah you're right.
748.0,Provider,So Swami.
12556.0,Patient,Karen you ask the hard question.
748.0,Provider,yeah kinda.
12556.0,Patient,"This is new, for me, it's it's not a bad thing it's just an observation it's actually good you know you're bringing it out you're. you're shining a light on things that don't want. That, though, what light shined on them."
748.0,Provider,You say that But is that really true.
12556.0,Patient,"I don't what like. Baby baby, you know the issues itself. But yeah."
748.0,Provider,"But you know there's there's a part of you that doesn't want shine light shined on them and there's another part of you that's carrying it with you, like a lead leads all the time and wants nothing more than to be free of that. And once a bright light shined on it, so it can heal. it's just scary. yeah and hearing his heart. really hard and my senses you've walked through this alone for. 38 years of your life."
12556.0,Patient,Starting.
748.0,Provider,"With what happened with your mother and the experience of being in a school. Like the school you attended and the avoidance of your father in dealing with what your mother was doing to you, and it sounds like your brother being the golden boy, and if the list feels endless. And then getting into one of the most prestigious schools in the nation and having become a place where you were abused even further."
12556.0,Patient,The world is hard to girl.
748.0,Provider,It is a is a challenging place a challenging planet a challenging time we're all beings but it is definitely more challenging for people of color and when. And you have both.
12556.0,Patient,"I saw something like a side yesterday for the women's March. That I really like. Lady held up a sign that said. you're not going to stop. Abortion you're just going to stop safe abortion. Yes, and. it's you know we have laws against animal cruelty, but what about cruelty to women. I know men experience cruelty to but you know."
748.0,Provider,men of color especially.
12556.0,Patient,"But this feels like you know. You know, help like dead animal cruelty, it feels like with it cruelty. Today, I have an appointment with my. General physician because. My Ob is. on maternity leave and she's not going to be back till after November, and you know, right now, the medical system is swamped i'm sure you know you're in it, you know you're probably. So up for work. And I think I might have a yeast infection. And I have so much anxiety about talking to my GP, who is a male but whenever I go to appointments with him my husband's there. So I am okay."
748.0,Provider,Like I hear that his subordinates and.
12556.0,Patient,"so supportive he's. he's so kind and he's President, but he. he's the first person to really hold space for me. I really lucked out with this guy."
748.0,Provider,"luck, out of it, you make a really good choose."
12556.0,Patient,"I made a really good choice he's a great guy. he's very supportive. But he doesn't judge and. We don't fight often where we do fight it's just you know. Oh, like. You haven't been here you've been obsessed with your work, you know I need your help, because. We had like a slight medical emergency over the weekend. And one of my dogs got stung by a bee for the first time ever. So. That we're never cruel to each other and our fight. He also comes from a difficult background oh. yeah."
748.0,Provider,And he's doing homework.
12556.0,Patient,"Yes, well do you mean mentally or or like occupationally."
748.0,Provider,mentally emotional.
12556.0,Patient,he's not currently figure therapist he. wants your brain is. yeah.
748.0,Provider,"Okay, oh he's he he would like to find it there."
12556.0,Patient,"It do the things that I read and I learned, we talk about it and i'm sorry our time is up."
748.0,Provider,"Well, we have an hour."
12556.0,Patient,And he he learns and grows through me because I will sit and talk to him about all the things that i've learned and theme that day.
748.0,Provider,i'm.
12556.0,Patient,From books or YouTube.
748.0,Provider,"Well i'm I am we can talk another time about the path that might be beneficial for him, but i'm just thrilled that you have such a strong support. As you really challenging."
12556.0,Patient,yeah.
748.0,Provider,"Time in your own words, for years, doing such. Deep and important work. What what was the catalyst that brought you to the work."
12556.0,Patient,"To to seek therapy. When covert one covert happened. i'm very German phobic. My my mom and my aunt they both have OCD. My my mom not officially diagnosed, but my aunt is officially diagnosed with OCD. and i've learned a lot of the German phobic behaviors from them. From my family. So I was the one doing all the shopping and going outside. and bringing it to my parents house for covert because they were so scared of you know covet, and so I would go and I would. We have a small SUV and just fill that car up with groceries every couple of weeks for my parents. My mom lies about me to my family members. and My parents are trump supporters. And i'm a. I i'm just the support of anybody who is not trump right now i'm just somebody who can do their job competently, you know I don't I don't care about. Your party or whatever, I mean I do care, but like you know I just i'm not a trump supporter, is what I want to say, I guess, this is one of the examples of you know i'm one of the more articulate um. But. Anyway, we got into a fight and then she lied and she said I kicked her out of the House when I never did I just. I would just ask her you know, like Do you really believe that you know he's doing. His job. And then they left they left my house I invited them over and the Left her house and then she said that I took them out. And I went no contact and then that gave me the clarity to be like you need to talk to people."
748.0,Provider,Okay.
12556.0,Patient,"Thank you. She. i've grown up in California my parents lived in California their whole life, except for you know before they when they immigrated. And now, they live in Pennsylvania. It just moved there, and my mom said that. She moved across the country because I was because of me. She told everybody in my family that she told anybody she could tell. And I went to visit her one last time to pick up some stuff from the House before they sold the House. And I had recorded the conversation because. She lies about me all the time and i'm so tired of it. And, if only to just have the recording for my own sanity. And I asked her straight up did I kick you out and she said no, it felt like it, and I said well felt feeling like getting kicked out and actually getting kicked out or two very different experiences. She doesn't get it."
748.0,Provider,proud of you for taking care of yourself. Something that's strong. Did it feel good to you.
