And he was threatening my dad and he actually my sister were there. We were really little and he threatened him like he looked at me my sister, and he goes.

13173.0,Patient,"Well yeah so I met my current boyfriend when I was at the 5150 place and I know it sounds crazy. Sometimes. I believe in God, and I believe that God guides us and does things in our lives. And when I saw him at that if you want to do it know what the place of St joseph's. Something in my my in me was just like talk to him talk to him, I never liked that and he even said. Some urge to talk to me and to ask questions and he actually asked if there was anybody renting a room or how to room available to rent and I like raise my hand like this, you know, I was kind of scared. yeah but I felt like it was what I was supposed to do and then so when I picked him up they I brought him home, I said I looked at him, like the first day and I thought i'm going to marry him and i've never ever felt that life. With anyone. So we've been together, ever since. And my my mom and my the rest of my family they don't like the fact that i'm with him. he's been a user he oh he's he's used almost this whole it started when I was a little boy, and then stop you know, of course, and then adult and stop and then go back and stuff. And I never had to use anything except for like marijuana and I actually just started marijuana maybe a year before I met him and. When I met him and my family was just like. Already not wanting to talk to me or anything I kind of just felt like wow I have nothing else to lose, and I have never tried this stuff before, so I just quickly tried everything that he brought around me. and You would say no don't do it don't do it, he was very against it. He I. I seriously just had this weird it was just weird i've never been like that right is totally let go of everything and just started trying stuff. I never really liked any of it, but I ended up using fentanyl. Because of the pain that I experience. It wasn't, the reason I used it and I didn't want to become addicted, of course. But it helped with my pain."
726.0,Provider,Okay yeah.
13173.0,Patient,"And then I actually lost a job during, why was just starting to use it."
726.0,Provider,"Okay, was it up cuz you were using that you lost it."
13173.0,Patient,"doesn't thing I always like Why would I fired nothing happened, but then my boyfriend said you were using like so what I didn't do anything weird, but when i'm So when I was sober and I remember watching him. My things that happened to him that he didn't know of, or he didn't realize, he was."
726.0,Provider,"Do Oh, I see yeah."
13173.0,Patient,"Well, that could happen to me I didn't realize, I was doing something."
726.0,Provider,"I don't know. yeah so. I think that. makes a lot of sense, so how long have you been using fentanyl for."
13173.0,Patient,"or they have one or a couple months, maybe."
726.0,Provider,A few months and what year I know you said it was around two years ago for St.
13173.0,Patient,josephs fiddle.
726.0,Provider,here. yeah okay.
13173.0,Patient,"When I met him I dabbled in a couple things I didn't become addicted until like. He used heroin, so I started smoking heroin just because it's like I got nothing else to do."
726.0,Provider,kind of bored yeah.
13173.0,Patient,"But, looking back I did I did get get on suboxone and we I did try the methadone. But I honestly think that I really needed it I probably could have just quit myself. Okay, what scared me was I was starting a job and I wanted to quickly get off, so it would be okay. That was this job that i'm talking about. And I think I was flying as I quit suboxone on my own I just stopped taking it. I lowered my dosage and I, you know went down and down. yeah totally fine um but probably not inside I just didn't realize it and then my boyfriend brought home fentanyl. And I. said, let me try it because he told me, it was a good painkiller and it's one of they get out in hospitals and, but of course this is. Man made obviously it allowed but it's not even probably it's on the street, you know, like someone streets making. As well yeah. yeah right it and it did I almost instantly felt better with my pain and so that's kind of why I kept using it."
726.0,Provider,And how did you finance your use like how were you able to.
13173.0,Patient,"The sad thing is that came before everything that came before read that came before food. And we certainly talked to like what are we doing we're so stupid, but then, when we run out, we will go get more because we didn't want to go from jaws we don't want to hurt. yeah and that withdrawal is the worst of any it's either with suboxone. The way that bright heart has there, like the way Dr London tells you to start the suboxone it definitely doesn't work for fitting all its needs to be revamped because finola such a strong drug that the suboxone doesn't nothing to it, the author, just like totally. Take so much to even touch the fentanyl."
726.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
13173.0,Patient,"I was a person. To it be out of my boyfriend and I, and I follow Dr was instructions. wanted to see how it was before he did it because he's been a user all his life and I felt like he was could be different for him, so I tried it first. It was horrible. mood I thought I was literally dying, I was going to go to the emergency room, but I I fought against it and. I it was awful and then, when he finally did it he couldn't follow the instructions, it was horrible so he had kept taking more."
726.0,Provider,How do you feel about being in treatment.
13173.0,Patient,"um. I don't mind it, this is actually better than anything i've done before. I just don't obviously doing it every week it's kind of hard. If I keep thinking if I get a job, what am I going to do you know. Okay, so, but I really like I like it's kind of hard being in a group so if every one of y'all hear you business that's kind of hard but."
726.0,Provider,Is there anyone that you don't want that you are in treatment. Like Is there anyone that you would not want them to know that you're in treatment.
13173.0,Patient,"In my life. yeah I don't want it my family knows, because i'm I told my sister. But I don't want anyone really friends or if I go to work I don't want anyone knowing it's embarrassing for me."
726.0,Provider,Like. Why do you think you feel that way about it.
13173.0,Patient,"Because i'm ashamed of it that I haven't got that far and I needed some help, but I couldn't just do it on my own, you know."
726.0,Provider,currently experiencing cravings.
13173.0,Patient,You got really low all sudden.
726.0,Provider,Oh sorry. Are you currently experiencing cravings.
13173.0,Patient,um no um I think about it will be nice to have my pain gone again but. I know i'm okay I don't really think about doing it.
726.0,Provider,um do you believe that your APP is that you're addicted.
13173.0,Patient,"um yeah I think I was because. Well it's like weird you you're you're continuously taking it because you don't want to feel the pain, without it, so whether or not you like it or not, you take it, you know. I was addicted because. Obviously it came before."
726.0,Provider,"It. leaves kind of horrible. And do you ever find that the same amount of whatever you use had. An effect on you like, I know that you said that when you were working you didn't notice that maybe something seems off to somebody else but you thought you were fine i'm like now looking back, how do you see. Your past us or how do you see it now basically."
13173.0,Patient,"um I embarrassed because I reached out to family. talk to them about because they they cut me out of their life completely like my mom and dad won't see. my brother won't talk to me my sister was the only one who kept talking to me, but I tried to hide it, you know my use. And mark my boyfriend and I kept going through our own stages of trying to withdraw, you know kick it on our own."
726.0,Provider,And then.
13173.0,Patient,"Take it so us and so she saw this pattern of me being super sick. But then I she she would kind of, say, stop taking that stuff because you know it's just as addictive as the drug, so I think she was thinking in her mind. That I was. Something to correct it like suboxone or whatever. We just kept going through withdrawals and trying to get help and some times, it was just awful and we were without we'd have a car, it was like right in the middle of me getting paid, so I had no money and then she had to bring us like water and ibuprofen and stuff. So I looking back it's embarrassing because it was obvious to a sober person that I was using but, in my mind, I was totally fine."
726.0,Provider,How much were you using what we're using.
13173.0,Patient,And we did.
726.0,Provider,It okay.
13173.0,Patient,and which I didn't realize until I went to ages for methadone I didn't realize until the doctor told me that that's the quickest way to get that into your system and I hit your brain and I because I thought that shooting up.
726.0,Provider,was worse.
13173.0,Patient,"He said no smoking actually was that was like oh my gosh. Yes, folks um. I would say, a gram a day or so."

13173.0,Patient,"I was yeah so my boyfriend and I were driving and he was super using but he was on like a few different drugs and drugs, so, while I drugs it doesn't do well with anyone, but especially him it froze him. Like into being manic and he's a totally different person. Sorry, I dropped my phone. And at the time I had smoked a little bit, and so, looking back, I know I was messed up, but during the time I thought okay well, he was threatening me with stuff that, of course, if he was sober he would never do. But it got to where I got really scared and i'm because he was certainly my me and threatening my family, but he would never do anything he was just high and same things that. The horse. silver he felt horrible for saying, but I actually got really scared and. We were separate cars at the moment and I drove so quick over to the. I was trying to drive to the police department, but I didn't want him to know, I was there, so I saw a cop. on the street and I weighed down and I try to get his attention will heat up immediately knew I was high and i'm sure, looking back. Well, I police station and. telling them and he came and they could see that he was high well they searched his car and he thought I told them to searches car. Because we were suffering, so he. said well she's got stuff on her I had his xanax on me, but it was obviously street xanax because I didn't have insurance or anything so. They asked. Do you have on you, and of course I said yeah I gave it to him, so I gotta like a ticket it's a misdemeanor and I had to go to court."
726.0,Provider,Okay.
13173.0,Patient,"When I went to court, I was terrified is the first time i've ever had to go to court for anything or be you know anything to do with the COPs and i'm my biggest fear is to go to jail, and so I kept thinking i'm going to go to. them. And I actually had to feeding into things, I guess, I had. taken care of. So when I went to court, the judge just said he was going to charge me like $289 for the tickets and just wipe away the the misdemeanor or whatever it was. So I really like. That I got off that easy so."

When we make our appointments is make sure, and just set a reminder, on your phone and then, if you know that, like let's say you do get a job and then you're not able to make that appointment. just call ahead of time, so you can. reschedule because what happens is like like let's say you get medications. Like for four days or like a week if if a person's not showing up to the individual sessions, or the group sessions you'll start to see that they're gonna. restrict a little bit so like if you weren't getting seven days they're going to start giving you four days, because you're not like they're not sure, whoever the person is i'm not saying you in particular, we have thousands. of patients here, but if they're not showing up you know, then that's what they do so we'll just make sure we'll have something set up and then like I said, if you can't make it you just call and they can schedule that so i'm gonna stay in two weeks I have. No idea right."
