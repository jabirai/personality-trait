408.0,Provider,"Hello hello, Mr paulie."
13689.0,Patient,Are you today.
408.0,Provider,All right. let's start with telling me about your experience since you restarted your ADHD treatment.
13689.0,Patient,"i'm. Gone Okay, with the. Lady he made he put me on I asked him, I asked him if he could increase on because i'm not really a difference."
408.0,Provider,"I remember you said, I was in group when you mentioned that that's why I wanted us to explore a little bit what's going on with that. And maybe some tips on how you could. approach your current dosage while you're waiting to receive an increase which medication is it."
13689.0,Patient,The arrow.
408.0,Provider,really is.
13689.0,Patient,it's 10 milligrams twice a day.
408.0,Provider,"it's not the extended release. Okay 10 milligrams is a starter Joseph. is, I think you figured out."
13689.0,Patient,"yeah. I was expecting this to some type of difference and really i'm not saying no difference i'm still fighting everything like I was, I mean. i'm still talking everybody's head off they're getting annoyed but I get annoyed by. i'm still pacing, the floor is constantly."
408.0,Provider,"What time, are you taking it twice a day."
13689.0,Patient,i'm taking it like nine in the morning and then like three in the day.
408.0,Provider,"or okay so until you can get your next level, because this has to be. triage up carefully to control for side effects. So until you can get your next increase from your starter dose. It will help you to achieve full potency of the dose you have. If your stomach is not full of food. When you take okay food will cut down on the effective dose by 25%."
13689.0,Patient,yeah that's why I.
408.0,Provider,don't.
13689.0,Patient,"know I normally take it out of the morning before I eat I don't only. And then during the day, like I don't need a whole lot during the day I normally the evening. But I mean I like 12 one o'clock. And I have the mornings, and then I dinner during the day, and I take an in between banner and I guess lunch."
408.0,Provider,"yeah I mean. You should not have a whole lot of food in your stomach then either now sometimes prescribers or even on the instruction label will tell people to take it with food, because having a stomachache is a very common side effect. Yes, the stimulant medications. But I picking up that you're not having any side effects so far."
13689.0,Patient,"No, no."
408.0,Provider,"Really. yeah so certainly taking it first thing in the morning before you eat anything. sounds like a good idea for you to get your maximum benefit. yeah and you haven't had any stomach cramping or pain with that, so far, so keep on doing that now here's The other thing to think about so when you take your medication in the morning hold off on eating anything for at least two hours. Because it takes the body, a while to actually digest and metabolize the effective dose of the adderall. And as you probably you may remember this from the last time, your ADHD was actually. treated is that typically for short acting it's supposed to be a four hour dose that peaks at the midpoint at two hours, but if you're on a low dose even at your next level, you may find this, you may only feel it benefit. You with the midpoint. And because, after that, the effect may fall off dramatically."
13689.0,Patient,"yeah and say like when I first started taking I was like Okay, you know i'm not losing anything yeah but I was like on one he taking it and then maybe i'll go again in my system to."
408.0,Provider,"No, no."
13689.0,Patient,"Okay, so let me explain this to you."
408.0,Provider,"So the stimulant medications that unless it's extended release. Right, but even extended release. By their chemical compound they are short acting they're in and out of the body very quickly. As differentiated say from the antidepressants that can take as long as six weeks for. You to build up a therapeutic dose level in your bloodstream your stimulant meds are not like that you're immediately getting what you're getting it's just that there's this curve of effect. For the short acting it's about four hours, so the midpoint that peak effect is it two hours and other things can interfere with the full benefits like taking it with food, taking it with other coffee or substances even smoking can can cancel out the effects of the adderall."
13689.0,Patient,Oh wow.
408.0,Provider,Are you aware of that.
13689.0,Patient,"No, I wasn't aware of that."
408.0,Provider,"yeah So if you really want to get maximum benefit from your ADHD treatment it's important that you take it as long as you're not having side effects. Take it without food, avoid having food until the adderall has a real chance to be digested and it's it's not that it's going to take weeks for you're just at a very low dose right now, which is probably insufficient right."
13689.0,Patient,yeah.
408.0,Provider,"But just to get into the habit now of taking it properly, so you can get the maximum benefit. I do suggest you try this out."
13689.0,Patient,yeah.
408.0,Provider,"You know, when you first get up. don't smoke don't chew tobacco, because that's a competing stimulant that will interfere with the action of the Admiral. Okay okay."
13689.0,Patient,"Nobody told me that but i'm not really with the morning guys, let us know about nine o'clock sometimes Laurel or but usually about nine o'clock i'll take it and I usually about 10 so I want to try about."
408.0,Provider,"That. Earlier, or maybe push eating to an hour later. In the other problem you have is that three. o'clock dose. yeah again, you need to make sure that if you are eating lunch. Well, maybe you won't eat lunch, if you eat a late breakfast honestly, but if you do eat lunch, make it really, really light. And quickly digested like a smoothie like you know I mean like a smoothie with vegetables or fruit and milk or yogurt or something you know what. is right. Something is very easily digested. Okay, know that basically you'll have an empty stomach ache again by the time you take that afternoon dose."
13689.0,Patient,"Okay, I want my nose today after today."
408.0,Provider,"Yes, and as far as any caffeine or nicotine avoid taking that for the first two hours after you take your ADHD meds."
13689.0,Patient,"Okay, all right."
408.0,Provider,"Just like an empty stomach right you're going to avoid any other stimulants at the same time. And then. As I say, let's say you're taking it three you should be seeing the most it's going to give you for treatment around five. yeah and after that it's such a low dose you may not notice any benefit. yeah."
13689.0,Patient,And I oh man i've not noticed anything really like okay. my mouth and stuff and my feet don't stop now. You are and.
408.0,Provider,What about your focus any increases in your ability to shift your attention back and forth between things.
13689.0,Patient,"Well, my CV comes in fact on that i'm not being diagnosed with OCD, but I am a very particular person when it comes to anything like something that would take normally an hour, though, it takes me longer because."
408.0,Provider,That can be your ADHD that could actually be your ADHD and.
13689.0,Patient,"yeah anything that I do. it's made them to my best like I don't care about go spend an extra hour on it to get it done the way I want it done, but I am very particular about about anything I mean anything I do i'm."
408.0,Provider,"So it might be OCD or it might simply be that you've trained yourself to hyper focus. Because of your untreated ADHD it's so hard to maintain. Your attentional focus that you've trained yourself to do one thing and just hyper focus on it, you know what I mean laser. focus on it yeah."
13689.0,Patient,"Come on, Michael Come on, you know. What hold on just a minute just."
408.0,Provider,"Well i'll give you an example of that Mr poly so a person that has fairly moderate to severe ADHD at their untreated. I might end up a questionnaire about their symptoms right and maybe it'll have 10 questions on it. And, most people can do it in minutes minutes, but a person with ADHD will be there, an hour later."
13689.0,Patient,yeah I. Think that's. i'm that person.
408.0,Provider,"So these are health, you know surveys can be extremely challenging for someone retreated adh."
13689.0,Patient,"A while ago yeah. And like I say that my fiance she. She just very recently started the program or so with bright heart. And like chicken go through her surveys, just like that. And they. Take my forever she's still going them i'm like you. want me to go."
408.0,Provider,To her explain. This is your attention deficit disorder. Because your brain can't really maintain focus for very long that's why it takes you so long. But you are finally now getting treated for it again and so things will get better you. know you sure everybody who's telling you shut up.
13689.0,Patient,yeah really you know I understand the people when they tell me the Nice be quiet or stop away everybody same time like it's embarrassing I really like that. You get on peoples nerves so bad that the Tongue him just please stop.
408.0,Provider,"me now. I know it is It makes you feel bad. And gently but, but again. You were just born with this."
13689.0,Patient,yeah for.
408.0,Provider,"Now, and. Then you can do some things to help yourself. We do use the symptoms but ultimately it has to be treated with medication. You do."
13689.0,Patient,"drop everybody. Everybody wonder like you know just be quiet and now you're talking too much or whatever i'm like look i'm trying i'm doing everything I can like it bothers me I know. You all but you know same time why i'm working i'm trying to get everything taken care of and you know everybody's supportive like pick one round were supportive. But they just they're honest with me they're like you know just quit your top two months or whatever, but even if they're not mad about it still embarrassing to me."
408.0,Provider,"I understand. So to deal with that stress of being embarrassed it would be important, I think if it's someone that you trust to simply say I feel really embarrassed about this, I really don't want to be annoying. And so I apologize, and I feel really bad about it. i'm trying to learn some ways to control it a little bit while i'm restarting the treatment. of medication and maybe you know that'll help you to get rid of some of the."
13689.0,Patient,"Good even my fiance yes, you know yesterday was my birthday, but we were all taught me her and her mom and. She was like I just stopped by you're just talking too much and then she comes to me a minute later and she's like my i'm sorry been embarrassed you she was like I know that you're trying to. To get better she's like I do understand that she's like i'm sorry for the embarrassed you and i'm. sure."
408.0,Provider,"Maybe it would also help if you think about that a little differently, that when somebody asks you to stop talking so much you think about it as they're like your secondary brain. you're trying to help you."
13689.0,Patient,Happy yeah yeah.
408.0,Provider,"embarrassed. yeah yourself okay that's a good reminder that's a good. reminder. And then you kind of walk into another room and take a few deep breaths and talk to yourself, for a while, or whatever."
13689.0,Patient,thought that make sense. been embarrassed ah look at this they're trying to help me.
408.0,Provider,"give you some feedback, because otherwise, how would you know. Right yeah. You feedback. But then you have to do something right, then you have to do something to try to help both of you. So you walk away so they've got a break from your talk. And you walk away so that you can do some of these breathing techniques that we've been doing and group. Try some of those they just take a few seconds. But that's a few seconds that you're kind of lowering the arousal in your brain. it's not an ADHD treatment. But it might help for a few seconds and the other thing we talked about that will help for longer is the exercise the robot the robot exercise. will help for an hour. Sometimes two hours, but you need to get your doctor to evaluate your hernia surgery, so that you can do it safely."
13689.0,Patient,yeah i've been back again I don't make an appointment with that would be on my heart is back again and okay.
408.0,Provider,"Well, this time, as I think I recommended this to you in our first session this time you really need to ask for physical therapy referral."
13689.0,Patient,"yeah yeah i'm gonna have to, because this is four times in the same spot."
408.0,Provider,"And I know transportation is difficult, but there is some medical transportation available to you, I know it isn't. Always trustworthy and reliable but. At."
13689.0,Patient,one. I found one that will take you back and forth a doctor's appointment.
408.0,Provider,"that's physical therapy is a healthcare appointment you just have to get the doctor's referral, and I promise you, you will benefit from that. And once you do the physical therapy, they will tell you. Which row and ask them which. aerobic exercises, can you do, that are not going to make this worse. or cause you so much pain that you can't do it. And what they may say to you, and this is often the case unfortunate they may say well let's say for you to do this, but it won't feel good. You know that's going to be. Right. yeah at least you have a choice you don't have to have the fear of injuring yourself, but just knowing that it may be uncomfortable. Oh, I think you accidentally muted yourself, Mr poly. There you go. What were you saying."
13689.0,Patient,"I said I wanted more but there's there's times like in the back of my mind i'm just like I want to do it, but i'm afraid."
408.0,Provider,"You want to do it, but you're afraid of injuring yourself."
13689.0,Patient,"Yes, I am."
408.0,Provider,"So so for now, what if you do something like wall push ups. Where you're not using the groin area, but you do them hard enough that you're breathing faster."
13689.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah the other, then I do the one of the round with your arms."
408.0,Provider,"Yes, exactly and. The top about top half of jumping Jacks. yeah, but you have to do them enough so you're breathing heavily that's what is going to help your ADHD for a little longer than a few seconds. yeah okay yeah try to keep experimenting with that now what when do you expect to get your next increase in adderall dosage."
13689.0,Patient,"Well, I asked him a group, and he said that he was going to check on and I just picked up."
408.0,Provider,You just picked up what.
13689.0,Patient,I just picked up a prescription yesterday and it's the same exact thing.
408.0,Provider,that there was a questionnaire he had sent you that you need to complete.
13689.0,Patient,I received it or not.
408.0,Provider,"The ADHD questionnaire when we're done in a minute go to the virtual clinic go back where you checked in. and ask them to send you the ADHD questionnaire. Okay, that Mr Cruz."
13689.0,Patient,You know.
408.0,Provider,"I know it's an ADHD screening instrument. and tell tell them that Mr Bruce said he had sent it to you, but you haven't seen it in your email. Okay, and it is lengthy, it is lengthy So if you need help filling it."
13689.0,Patient,out.
408.0,Provider,"If you call back to once you get it. To the virtual clinic. One of the care navigators will help you go through it. will help you to focus. Right, so you do each question with them. And they'll remind you what your answer is you click on that, and then you go to the next one, it really does help you to have someone with you to talk you through the questionnaire."
13689.0,Patient,don't be afraid to do.
408.0,Provider,That don't be embarrassed or do that.
13689.0,Patient,definitely do that.
408.0,Provider,"Because the sooner, you get that done, the sooner, you can get your next increase they just have to monitor your side effects and symptoms, in order to justify the next increase. Okay. And you're already trouble asleep right."
13689.0,Patient,"nah man just with the with the slave i'll have no trouble one asleep staying asleep SMA fine. At night but. You told me last time, like, I was doing my PhD so."
408.0,Provider,"that's right. that's right they worry they worry sometimes about giving you too much dosage of adderall late in the day, thinking that it might keep you awake but actually most people i've worked with who have that moderate to severe ADHD they actually get to sleep better and stay asleep longer. yeah if they have that late afternoon dose. yeah or even or even a small dose at bedtime."
13689.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I think because, like I said, my friend was not falling asleep and i'm Am I travel just staying asleep all night like I get up from time to time, oh man I. i'm still getting good sleep if that makes sense."
408.0,Provider,"yeah no that's good that's good how many times, did I do you wake up."
13689.0,Patient,"Oh, probably this couple it's like to two times, or three times a night."
408.0,Provider,In your sleeping till about nine you said.
13689.0,Patient,yeah. I mean.
408.0,Provider,Well that's good.
13689.0,Patient,"If you've got school stuff so we go to bed get them up for school. So well yeah i've been getting up at like seven getting him up for school here lately, but then I laid back down to about nine."
408.0,Provider,"Oh, I see."
13689.0,Patient,yeah.
408.0,Provider,So you could. You could take your first dose of adderall before you go back to bed for that extra nap.
13689.0,Patient,yeah that's what I say about eight maybe there.
408.0,Provider,"So that by the time you wake up, you took it on an empty stomach because I assume you're not eating while you're getting the kids to school. So you take it on an empty stomach you take a nap and then by the time you get up, first of all, it might be close to peaking you know the peak benefits. You could try that and see. If you feel more of a benefit."
13689.0,Patient,yeah yeah definitely. yeah yeah like I said i'm in but I always take it like even in the evening those i'll take the in between meals so i'll take my even those on an empty stomach so.
408.0,Provider,"Well yeah because it really does cut down on the efficacy of it. yeah now again unless you're having stomach pain. If you're having stomach pain, then you have to take it with you know glass of milk or something to cook the stomach but you're not having that."
13689.0,Patient,"saga, no, no, I don't have any side effects from ADHD medicine."
408.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, so the thing we worked on today, then, besides reviewing your experience with ADHD treatment and what you need to do right to get to the next dosage increase. Right so that's top priority is get back to the vc get hold of that questionnaire fill it out, make sure you have an appointment, Mr Cruz. yeah as soon as possible right. You did, are you."
13689.0,Patient,On a two. and a half.
408.0,Provider,"yeah absolutely make as soon as possible appointment with him, but he's going to need to look at that, at your response to that survey instrument. The special one for ADHD."
13689.0,Patient,"Yes, stopping and fill it out today, and when I call to get that i'll have him give him an appointment with him."
408.0,Provider,"Right um I mean it's fine to go ahead and get the soon as your appointment with him, you just have to make sure that you've done the questionnaire before the appointment that's, the main thing, so he has to see it."
13689.0,Patient,i'm gonna go ahead and do that survey today.
408.0,Provider,"Okay, if you can."
13689.0,Patient,"call them again, or you know i'll get it done today."
408.0,Provider,"and good and again it's going to be challenging so don't hesitate to call a care navigator check into vc and ask for a cure navigator and help you fill it out, which is just them staying on the phone with you and talking you through each question. And then your brain is going to say oh my God is that this or is it, this is. You know. or your brain is going to say oh i'm not that way well, maybe I am That way, you know. About a symptom you know what the brain does right. Now, having the care navigator there with you to talk you through it and chin down and answer."
13689.0,Patient,If.
408.0,Provider,You call your body that makes it so hard to make a choice naked. yeah yeah having someone there will help you to get it done within a reasonable time frame.
13689.0,Patient,"Because i've been there, I like. yeah overthink everything. Just."
408.0,Provider,Right yeah. It could be this could be.
13689.0,Patient,100 miles an hour and I can't keep up with it.
408.0,Provider,"yeah so to get this done i'm recommending you're not hesitate to ask them. And they might not be used to getting that kind of request, so you might need to explain I have attention deficit disorder and this is. going to be a long questionnaire, so I really need some help just talking having someone help me talk through the items and the different choices, otherwise it could take me days."
13689.0,Patient,"Now i'm on vacation when do you know he's probably back for a couple weeks, he. said right."
408.0,Provider,"You know what I would go ahead and do this anyway. yeah because he may still be checking his email. yeah I don't know when he's actually leaving for vacation I know he's not going to be at group the next two weeks, but he may still be around who knows. yeah no I would jump on this today, if I were you."
13689.0,Patient,today. focus on.
408.0,Provider,Good top priority right.
13689.0,Patient,yeah yeah definitely definitely.
408.0,Provider,"And then do you need to make a note of some of your compensatory strategies, instead of being embarrassed when people say things to you need to write down some of the strategies, you said you try out."
13689.0,Patient,"yeah like i'm definitely gonna i'm definitely going to think of it as a positive or negative. i'm not gonna let it bother me i'm almost one like you said I must one use it, as you know, they're trying to do. yeah yeah. yeah yeah definitely."
408.0,Provider,You can remember that you think you'll remember. What about the strategy of walking into another room and either doing wall push ups or doing your breathing exercises.
13689.0,Patient,yeah yeah I will focus on those on those things i'm really going to push myself to like I think most of them will help. The ones definitely gonna be good for me not to think of it as a negative.
408.0,Provider,yeah.
13689.0,Patient,that's really going to help me.
408.0,Provider,"Good good, and then we also agreed to try some different tips around maximizing the benefit of your current adderall those you need to write those down or do you."
13689.0,Patient,"yeah I remember yeah i'm just gonna start taking it after I get them off to school and everything i'll take it then and then. empty stomach wait two hours, and then by the time I get back up, it should be around time for the peak. So yeah i'm definitely i'm definitely gonna focus on that just taken an hour earlier, and what I normally take it."
408.0,Provider,And then the afternoon dose you're going to try what.
13689.0,Patient,"i'm gonna do it in between the two like i've been doing, but I want to try, I will check in on the empty stomach as well."
408.0,Provider,Or at least a very light lunch.
13689.0,Patient,yeah and I will wait. Two hours. or 18 or anything for two hours.
408.0,Provider,"avoid caffeine and nicotine, the other stimulants that can interfere with it absolutely."
13689.0,Patient,"yeah definitely i'll keep myself busy to our. Here again, very good and for one thing, if nothing else."
408.0,Provider,You won't have the caffeine or nicotine muddying up the waters as far as being able to tell what this dose of adderall is actually doing.
13689.0,Patient,yeah yeah but i'm at the worst like the only thing I would have did within a two hours different that I have been doing i'm white smoke a cigarette within two hours without a whole lot. So i'm really i'm not been. I don't feel that i'm bothering my dose but at same time like I am born pay more attention to.
408.0,Provider,Like you say it's just timing it's just a timing issue.
13689.0,Patient,yeah I will pay more attention to what i'm doing within that two hours okay.
408.0,Provider,"sounds good now, is there any other stress or event that has come up that you had any negative or self harming thoughts anything else come up, we need to talk about."
13689.0,Patient,I don't ever think negatively. About hurt myself or hurt anybody oh. yeah.
408.0,Provider,So the only negative has been the embarrassment.
13689.0,Patient,yeah yeah that's the issue that.
408.0,Provider,The kids doing in school so far.
13689.0,Patient,"they're known good. Is this hate to care they're in between one to shut the schools down or keep them open. Actually, I have had some stressful stuff come up since last time I talked to you. My my hero test positive for coven. Okay yeah and she's passed her 10 day page, but now I have three more than. The. test. Now we get there we'll get there results back today should get it."
408.0,Provider,yeah joke it's no joke.
13689.0,Patient,"No, and I mean they told me to say my eight year old back to school. Before we got her check the second time, and I was like. No, you know she's not been tapped yet and they're like well she can come back school and then, when they send her school was like no I took her took her doctors appointment first and with her doctors appointment and she tested positive second time."
408.0,Provider,But why.
13689.0,Patient,"They explained to me the reason she tested positive second time say she'll test positive for months after. Being I just tested positive, the first time, said now every time she takes as short as possible because she's already got an inner system so even her testing positive the sake of time she's still clear. Which didn't make sense to me but that's what."
408.0,Provider,"Of course, because the body, the body is still even unvaccinated is still trying to fight off."
13689.0,Patient,The virus.
408.0,Provider,yeah so it's the level of antibodies that they will also look at that complicates the picture. um you know it's a good thing you don't want an immune suppressed good.
13689.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
408.0,Provider,"What makes it that way that's what makes it that way, but how is she feeling."
13689.0,Patient,"it's not slow down. Okay, why she's not she's a very she's applying. is not affected her."
408.0,Provider,Without giving it to the whole rest of the family now.
13689.0,Patient,"yeah man congested with her only main thing like she was really condition. But yeah we all win tested after the 10 day period after hurricane days is up, we all wind up a certain way or negative. Good well and then a few days later, the other kids get sick so is like four or five days after we all got taste so negative now they're all sick and they're showing symptoms, so we can get yesterday I got pastor and we're supposed to get the results back within 24 to 48 hours."
408.0,Provider,Oh man okay well you know the drill now.
13689.0,Patient,we're not.
408.0,Provider,"Making that you know you know that even when the children are not show are not showing much symptoms, they can still be contagious they can pass it. On everybody random."
13689.0,Patient,yeah definitely we got three four in pain in a room right now.
408.0,Provider,"Well, I will send. blessings their way, hoping that they don't get really, really sick."
13689.0,Patient,"Yes, thank you very much."
408.0,Provider,"Yes, Sir, all right, Sir, are you available in two weeks, for your next individual session. Okay let's see about the time. All right, what about 530. At."

408.0,Provider,All right. and will cause our fingers that maybe by then you'll have a little more benefit from your ADHD treatment. It will see.
