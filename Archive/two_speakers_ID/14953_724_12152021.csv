14953.0,Patient,"yeah I did because HALO the HALO infinite campaign is out i've been playing that and I play it's like nine in the morning, the other day, you know all night until nine in the morning completely screwed up my sleep pattern and then. So I ended up sleeping and getting up at like. Nine or 10 at night. Okay, and I just what I did was I tried to go right back to sleep and got up at like four. So that way and I stayed up all day yesterday and I went I went to bed at. Like 11 I tried, but I laid there for a couple hours strike fall asleep, and then I get up today like 730."
724.0,Provider,"All right, so your your your whole sleep patterns all kind of whacked out that's why. yeah yeah okay."
14953.0,Patient,"My turn on my thing. yeah it's completely. Random I usually don't have anything to do so, like important. But um. I needed to start making myself a certain time, every day, even if I don't want anything to do like. It at least before noon, because i'm just. i'm tired of sleeping so late that by time I get up and eat breakfast and stuff it's getting dark basically because it gets dark so we're really. You know, and it just I think that's one reason it gets more depressing at this time of year for me because i've been sleeping and Harley seeing the sun."
724.0,Provider,"Right you take any multivitamins do you do any like supplements would like vitamin D, I think we talked about that last time."
14953.0,Patient,"yeah I used to always take a multivitamin and. Not vitamin D, but right now i'm taking extra vitamin C, but i've been taking a multivitamin because i've been drinking and premier protein shakes lot and they have 25% of everything pretty much in each one. yeah so I but I guess I probably should take a multivitamin too, because I don't eat healthy and I don't drink for those a day usually so."
724.0,Provider,that's good what's the sugar countless things.
14953.0,Patient,"that not much it's a think like wonder am. Is all and it's one gram of fat. I can I get. Real low sugar the premier protein or 30 grams of protein, and I think only one one or. Two grams of sugar and then one gram of fat, but if then Sometimes I get done with different kinds, too, but most of them have like under five or six grams of sugar and then I like this chocolate milk i've been getting called fair life."
724.0,Provider,her life is good yep.
14953.0,Patient,yeah it's kind of like half the sugar and sky twice well almost twice the protein it's got. 30% yeah it's a lot better for you. So I get that and it's it's got enough protein where it's almost like drinking a protein drink it's got more sugar than the protein drinks do but um.
724.0,Provider,"Some sugar is good because it'll like. what's the as a word for it so like after you work out, you know that they tell you, having some sugar is. Like chocolate milk is like the best thing for you have like like for like a post workout like a recovery drink like even even have to do a protein drink, just like chocolate milk is as like the right balance of good fats good sugar and. calories in it, you know it's they say it's like almost like the perfect post workout recovery."
14953.0,Patient,"I figured it probably is an affair life, probably, it will be even better. For like after working out."
724.0,Provider,"yo you know, but you got to make sure that you're eating like like real food to like you can't. live off of. Protein drinks, because the body. Their supplements right so like that's what they're not meant to be the primary sources will say like offset like a one meal, you know, out of like your traditional type of thing or like a launch or snack. Because your body needs. Your body needs to work and break down. You know, tangible stuff like if you're just drinking your diet like that's not healthy, you know what I mean like. Your stomach and you're not getting like proper balance."
14953.0,Patient,"you're trying to eat like I get a whole wheat bread and I get the natural peanut butter. That it's it's I because I read it. it's a lot better it doesn't have that on what's it called the hydrogenated um. So there's something in it that regular peanut butter has that kind of counteract the how good the healthy fats are, and you know peanut butter has to that a lot of the mono unsaturated fat will play with a like regular normal average fran has that. Whatever that ingredient is so I get the natural kind. Because this would be better, and I think it actually tastes better really. yeah, and so I try I peanut butter sandwich once a day, then it lease and then."
724.0,Provider,You eat it like any fruit.
14953.0,Patient,yeah actually I got i'm Clement times right now.

724.0,Provider,yeah near the top of the fruit that.
14953.0,Patient,"means I like kiwi. But I don't get up to uncover walmart and now that I always have fruit, so I need to start going up there more often because walmart's not that for it's about a half mile walk kroger's a little farther it's a mile but. Other net there's just dollar general and dollar tree they don't really have they don't have any type of fruit or. See walgreens it doesn't either, but I seem walgreens does have some."
724.0,Provider,Finance bananas like dried fruit stuff like that.

I got I got a whole bag of like nutrition bar things to like what is that one brand that you get everywhere cliff like yeah. quit I have some. Other ones too, when I was at kroger's I got like 15 different types of will not different types, but I mean 15 bars like fright five different brands to try something new. and I know at kroger there's this bar I like it they're expensive though and it's supposed to be really good for it for you it's called the perfect bar and its main ingredients peanut butter, but it's got all kinds of organic vegetables in it um but they're like two to $3 apiece. There, what I can find my walmart or i'm in kurvers but at walmart they're easy to find the right by the yogurt and. walmart kroger though said they were in the dairy part department and I looked everywhere, I looked on online and it said look in the dairy department, but I couldn't find them, but because it's a little cheaper if you get them in the box that comes, I think, with for and. yeah there's a really good it's like eating my my grandma even tried to buy it, you said it tastes like peanut butter fudge sure. And a real they're really good they're really high and mono unsaturated fat they I think that, if I remember right Dave likes 14 grams of protein and. Man, but they have like 15 grams of fat, but it's like 90% the mono unsaturated fat i'm bitter just called the perfect bar, if I remember right, so I just started getting known as a couple months ago and I I love the taste of them, the weird taste At first I didn't like it and I guess."
724.0,Provider,yeah because they're jamming and all stuff into it.

I thought about it, I just think i'm in the last couple weeks mm hmm most time my mind's been on Christmas It stresses me out of. course you know and i'm not just by. worrying about buying and those gifts and all that stuff and then because. i've been talking to my sister a little bit more lately. yeah she actually stopped by and see me the other day for non long been for like 20 minutes at least. Her boyfriend or husband. Actually they're not married they've been together like 20 years but they're not married um. he's always in a hurry and he's always in a bad mood, it seems like so."

TV, whatever it is, after you get to the five you're going to find out for things that you could touch, so I go around physically touch for things and then. Once you're done with that three things that you can hear so like identified like three different things in your surroundings, that you can hear. Two things that you can smell right, so you know, take a few seconds focus on that and then one thing that you can taste so like at the end, like I don't like reward yourself go eat like a piece of cake, or something like that it's called like 54321 so the five."
