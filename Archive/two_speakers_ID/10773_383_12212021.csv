10773.0,Patient,Hello amanda.
383.0,Provider,How are you this morning.
10773.0,Patient,And i've been pretty stressed out and anxious for the last few days.
383.0,Provider,Okay well let's do you want to talk about that today. yeah okay.
10773.0,Patient,"yeah I think talking about it will help. Okay, you know, and my mother in law's bank going to come stay with us well now she's for sure coming and they she'll be there, the week after Christmas. and We found out she has stage four melanoma cancer. And they wanted to put her in hospice her doctor did, but she refuses to go there, so. My husband's going to get her and bring her to our place which then I responsible for everything, of course, because he works so i'm. stressed out about taking care of the dog taking care of my mother in law, because my dog, you know we live. In a fifth wheel, because we planned on retiring next year and traveling so we got rid of the House and our fifth will is one bedroom two and a half bath so we had to set her up in part of the living room. So i'm just like really stressed about and then of course there steep stairs going out where i've already fallen down twice so i'm worried about her falling because she's also blind."
383.0,Provider,What right right and she's going to be with you for one week.
10773.0,Patient,No she isn't going to be there permanently.
383.0,Provider,"Oh, oh okay."
10773.0,Patient,In a week she'll be coming.
383.0,Provider,she's going to stay with you permanently. I thought there had been some some solution that had surfaced with regards to your mother in law.
10773.0,Patient,"I thought, so too, like we thought she. We, we did not, I mean we knew she had skin cancer, but we didn't know how bad it was until she called my husband, the other night crying. Because they wanted to put her in hospice in. Your hospice care."
383.0,Provider,Can you drop your camera down somehow.
10773.0,Patient,"Oh sorry. They wanted to put her in hospice care and she retired from nursing homes, she worked in the regular hospitals, but when she before she retired she worked in nursing homes so her biggest fear is to go into that type of care. And where she's living it's not my husband doesn't want her there because his brother and his brothers. roommate are basically using her as a money machine."
383.0,Provider,So i'm sorry so she currently resides at your your husband's brother's.
10773.0,Patient,yeah his half brother in Las Vegas.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, and she's uh she thinks she's unhappy there."
10773.0,Patient,"She wants to stay there through Christmas and then. I almost feel like she wants to continue to stay there, but i'm not sure about that, so I my husband told her we'll we'll go get you bring you for a couple weeks and see what you think. But he his plan is to keep her there permanently."
383.0,Provider,"Keep your husband's plan is to have your have his mom stay with you guys permanently. Okay, does he feel she's not getting she's not in a good situation. Staying with yes brother. Yes, is that related to the fact that there is actually a problem or that they don't quite get along maybe sometimes that happens."
10773.0,Patient,"And they're stealing money from her. There and they're charging her like $500 a month, just to live there in a room. And then during throughout the month because my husband's on her cow. Throughout the month they're continually you know she's blind she doesn't play video games she doesn't watch movies and there'll be all these charges for purchases of video games on Amazon and for movies and. But the only time they want to take her anywhere or do anything is when they want to her to go get money so she's not getting companion shit you know love it's more of a. We want you here, because we want your check."
383.0,Provider,"got it got it. yeah that's. that's a tough situation. So, so is she amenable even even with that circumstance is she saying yes, I or it's more like i'll come and see if it works out if I like it, and then I will stay."
10773.0,Patient,"Yes, that's what. he's saying yes."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, because you know, going from a room in a house to someone's living room. For her might not be the greatest setup you know. yeah to be in your living room versus to be in her own room, I mean it, you know, even if she has to pay her son some money you know, to have to be in a room and in their home that might be a better circumstance, for her."
10773.0,Patient,Well they're also 10 people living in that House in a three bedroom house is stepbrothers a little bit slow and so he has taken it upon himself taken homeless people off the street.
383.0,Provider,Oh so it's like not a safe.
10773.0,Patient,Environment safe environment now.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so um. Well, this is definitely I just want to validate for. You like this is. This is a stressful situation that you guys are dealing with and."
10773.0,Patient,"I feel like it's all being put on me. I do worry about her if we had a House still i'm sure it would be easier, but i'm just last night I just couldn't even go to sleep. i'm staying at my daughter's right now, for I came here Friday and i'm staying here till Wednesday and then i'm going to my oldest son's house through Christmas. And it's just last night I ended up having to take a lorazepam to be able to relax enough to go to sleep."
383.0,Provider,yeah you know. Are you comfortable at your daughter's House is that just for you. Right yeah. you're comfortable there okay.
10773.0,Patient,"yeah because the grand baby, you know he just gives so much love and I don't have to, because where we live in the fifth, but we have a yard. But it's all fake grass, so I have to walk my dog and every time she needs to go the bathroom and here there's a doggie door and she has another dog to be with."
383.0,Provider,I see.
10773.0,Patient,"Not and then ben's house it's the same heat she has her best friend, is my son's service dog Elliot."
383.0,Provider,"I those he loves to play with him and so that gives me a break, not having to."
10773.0,Patient,worry about walking her continually.
383.0,Provider,"Yes, yes I. I understand that it's Nice, you can travel with your dog and your kids have a good spot for for you and for your dog, and you can feel comfortable there so that's one thing to kind of. just remind yourself in the moment you know, in terms of a supportive environment that you do have access to right now over the holidays. yeah."
10773.0,Patient,"I just feel like because I tried to come a week every month and spend time with my daughter, and my son. And i'm not going to be able to do that anymore with her there, unless I can find somebody that will come stay with her in our trailer you know that's a you know when my husband's working."
383.0,Provider,"Sure sure. What, what is the. Communication like, with your husband around this issue right now."
10773.0,Patient,"He is very stressed out about it, I can tell, and so. I can't really talk to him about it, or it turns into him getting extremely defensive."
383.0,Provider,Okay okay. um.
10773.0,Patient,And I understand.
383.0,Provider,Right right. um. i'm so sorry ellie and. I notice is that there's a lot a lot.
10773.0,Patient,"yeah you've been there, you know how much work it is."
383.0,Provider,"I do, and and. And it's just a really. challenge challenging. Because people have strong emotions around their parents, you know and around their siblings and you know what the siblings are doing or not doing, and then the money situation. yeah that's being handled and. people get really have really strong feelings about it and then there's the just the care, you know that for an elder particularly that has site problems in a limited space where you are. yeah."
10773.0,Patient,"yeah her. My husband step dad her has been which was basically my husband his dad and I took care of him when he was dying of cancer and he had pancreatic cancer as so I just you know right now i'm so. i'm not. i'm not in this that healthy state of mind, as I was back then that's been back in 2007 I just I love her to death she's she's always been so good, to me, but it's like I feel like am I going to be able to do this."
383.0,Provider,"Right right. well. that's I think that a core kind of. inquiry that you have and where you can do some work. to bolster your stuff self and consider that. You know, building your strength and your resilience and your. day to day ability to manage. Your own internal stress and anxiety, you do have some skills that you've developed and that you and you have made improvements this year. yeah through a tough time you're in, and I mean I know you go through you know you go through some pretty big still you know periods of difficulty with with the anxiety, but you are in a better place than you were."
10773.0,Patient,"Yes. Yes, I just don't want to fall backwards it's like right now I feel like I need you know anxiety medication when I wake up and anxiety medication to go to bed. And I had gotten to where I was only taking half of the alert as a Pam before last week, when you know all this came into play. And I do my breathing last night I went to bed at 730 I was so tired and I couldn't fall asleep till after 10 because I couldn't get my mind to shut up, and it was just was on a negative repeat, you know of. Sure everything bad I couldn't it took me forever to get I finally had to just get my phone put it right beside my pillow. and turn on the wave and relaxation music and I took over as a Pam and, finally, I know it was after last time I looked at the clock, it was 1015 and I finally fell asleep. But then this morning i'm up at 630 because it's all you know flooding back into my head and do my put my hand on my belly. breathe take the deep breaths and I have a couple little polities moves that i've been doing, you know I don't want to do too much because my pains been crazy lately too, because all the changes in the weather."
383.0,Provider,"Well pain physical pain, I think, will increase when we have more emotional distress, because I think the body gets. there's sort of inflammation emotional inflammation and then that that going to affect the body physically but i'm not a scientist, but I I usually I see correlations in myself, you know, so I think that. You know, I think that taking things One the one day at a time. motto, you know kind of one moment at a time starts to become a tool that's useful in these kinds of moments. And maybe planning a conversation with your husband, asking him, you know let's let's pick a time. to sit down and kind of think this have a conversation of just how is this going to work. In the long run yeah and and and even just work out the day to day of the next two weeks, you know. so that you can have a little more conversation I don't know does that seem like something that would be helpful for you to just kind of."
10773.0,Patient,"I don't know if it almost seems more stressful because he is so defensive and he gets he see he's going through a lot of stuff right now to he's. having problems with his lungs so he's seeing an internal list and then he has a huge growth on his wrist that he's gonna have to see hands specialist and have it removed so. I know he's done, you know and the doctors, he has to see or like a two hour drive to get to, and so I know he's. If I go to talk to him about any of this is already suppressed, it could just turn into a fight, and I am so not good with with confrontation anymore."
383.0,Provider,Right right right. The other thing is that. Have you guys talked about rethinking your retirement plan and the light of how things are in our new this new era.
10773.0,Patient,"yeah we my husband and my youngest son and went and looked at a house with some property. that they are going to try and buy but that's going to be, you know that takes a few months because it's a foreclosure, and so we do have good friend who's a broker. And so he's the one brokering the House so when the you know he can get us set up that way, but then you still got escrow and everything else. And then, my main my main fear with that is like my brain just will not fit having. Negative thoughts is it's in the mountains and i'll be able to use my hotspot to do my group and to meet with you, but my regular doctors i'm going to have to find a new regular doctor and going through that gives me a lot of stress, because then i've got to go over everything on why. You know, with my health and I get just just starting over with a new doctor escape."
383.0,Provider,Is this is this home somewhere in your somewhat in your area.
10773.0,Patient,"No, no it'll be an hour closer to my kids in the mountains."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, what what just maybe because I used to live in California so."
10773.0,Patient,it'll you know we're cursed is.
383.0,Provider,Not offhand but but.
10773.0,Patient,"it's. Okay, you go through oh curse to go to you, somebody."
383.0,Provider,Okay okay.
10773.0,Patient,"And so it's probably I think an hour and a half from you, somebody in the hills."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, and. I thought you were well. on the beach right now yeah and so it's. it's a considerable distance from where you are right now."
10773.0,Patient,"Oh yeah it's. See three and a half hours, from where i'm at now."
383.0,Provider,I see the closer to where one of your son's lives.
10773.0,Patient,"And closer well my son the youngest son he lives right next door to us right now well not next door, but he lives in where we in our area. And so he's going to him and his wife, are going to move with us and then my other son and my daughter will only be an hour from us we're right now there are two and a half hours from us."
383.0,Provider,God God.
10773.0,Patient,"And my oldest son, he was always extremely close with this grandma always gross with both his grandma so I know you know if I need help, I can ask them for help. And will actually any of the kids except for my daughter because she's got so much going on with the bait you know the baby and. and her life that I wouldn't ask her. To yeah it'd be just too much."
383.0,Provider,"yeah, so there is the potential that you could move into a home. Where there's going to be much more space."
10773.0,Patient,Yes.
383.0,Provider,"And a room for your mother in law and. More closer to your some of your children, young and so and then your son would be moving with you um. Can you enlist your son to help you somewhat with his grandmother. Lives close as."
10773.0,Patient,"Much as much as elder son that lives close to me. yeah and. I know he'll come up and help you know when he can, but they just started. In vitro for their the last I think I told you about them, trying to have a baby and she only have three eggs that were good and so she's already lost they already tried twice and they lost the babies so they're getting ready for to start. Everything at get well she already started the shots and everything but they're getting ready to have the last one implanted. So, like, I want to keep her you know I would never let him take his grandma to their house, because I don't want my daughter in law to have that kind of stress and because my mother in law she's she's she loves everyone, but she is a full time job. She retired from nursing because of her health and so she's. she's great and she's her mind is still there, but she's very much so, almost like a child. You know she's you have to make that you know you have to go make her take a shower, and so I know where she staying now that she's probably only baby once a week because, when she lived with us before after my husband's and step dad died. I had to every morning i'd run the bath. And I tell you got to take a bath and she's like well I don't feel like it, I said well you know water costs and I already filled the tub you know I had to use. You know, ways to make her givens so that's going to be a big job you know again making her do things she needs to do."
383.0,Provider,yeah yeah I think that her going on hospice. is not a bad thing. Because they provide in home kit you know people coming in that can provide for assistance with activities of daily living.
10773.0,Patient,Okay.
383.0,Provider,"So actually if she's in fourth stage melanoma and there's a doctor that's willing to write an order for her to be on hospice. Wherever you know if she's in your part if she's in you're staying with you guys that order can still be written and she can be on hospice and that entitles you to a lot of supports. that's something to look into and not and not to be taken. You know, sometimes one thing about hospice sometimes it's like oh my gosh like how many people are my dad was on hospice twice so so I know. How many people are coming here like there's there's the nurse there's the person that's coming to do the bathing there's the you know Chaplin there's the you know music therapist there's and sometimes it can be like kind of overwhelming. But the amazing thing about hospice is they will deliver their medications. And now there's always sometimes questions about the medications and are these just you know that can turn it can turn into little nests of. stress and trouble but. You will get people coming to your."
10773.0,Patient,"This help with his fault, you know the step dad but with them, it was. It was just the medication part they did, and then checked his vitals and all that kind of stuff they never. You know, and I they try helping with the bathing but my mother in law, she just even though she was half blind at the time she wanted to do that for him. So I would go in with her, and I would turn my back, and I would help her like roll him from backwards, so that he still had the dignity of me not seeing him, you know, in the nude and I would get her the water bucket or the water pan and everything. But if they help with the others that you know I I can add you know tell them, this is what I need help with right."
383.0,Provider,"Well, yes, up to a point that you know it all depends on the people that you the people that show up you know if they. How serviceable they are, and sometimes how willing, they are to go outside of their boundaries, and you know it's but there can be a lot of services, you can avail yourself from. And then there's volunteers, you know there's there's hospice volunteers, that will come and just hang out with the patient and and then you can you know go and go get out of the House or go visit I mean it's usually not it's just a couple of hours you know here and there, but."
10773.0,Patient,That gives me an out to go walk the beach and every group myself.
383.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
10773.0,Patient,"And then we'll move to the mountains, I could give me a break to walk the property and regroup."
383.0,Provider,def definitely and having those other you know there's also social workers that kind of come into and. also give you support sometimes you know talk to you and so. Are you. know I mean is your husband unwilling to have her go on hospice or anybody unwilling or feeling like oh that's nice she's not ready for that or.
10773.0,Patient,"They just don't he doesn't want to put her in a hospice home, you know they wanted to hospice home. Okay yeah."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, but we know you would be willing to get help with hospice."
10773.0,Patient,If they're coming to the House.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, well, I I think that's it that. that's an option. Not every not everybody that's on hospice is in a hospice home, many people are at home, you know, and then they have hospice care coming to the home."
10773.0,Patient,Okay.
383.0,Provider,"So, how does that make you feel that you may have access to the services."
10773.0,Patient,"gives me some peace of mind. I mean i'm still. Of course, anxious about it, but if I can get a little bit of help. i'll take it."
383.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. Oh, you the connection is a little bit. Compromise there."
10773.0,Patient,That better.
383.0,Provider,"yeah so the thing is ellie is part of when we have stress and when we're anxious, can you hear me okay. Yes, when we're stressed and anxious the the the relaxation techniques they're they're really good and important and you just continue with those you know all the things we've talked about that you know and then sometimes there are situations that require problem solving. i'm going to order to set some things sort of in place to make the situation run more smoothly to be prepared and so. I think when you wake up at six in the morning, you know get your pad of paper out get a pen out and start you know, making a list of. Okay, this person is coming to stay here if this person is going to be on hospice who's who's going to call the hospice and get that set up, you know, whatever you know Problem Solving ideas are popping into your head, you know get those on paper. And that will help you. To start to bring your some of your anxiety down when you feel like you've got a little control, you know, like Okay, you know this is going to be the shelf where she's going to have her toiletries. Because you know she's coming for a couple of weeks, just to. stay with you to see how it goes. yeah and then you know what blankets, need to be there, you know kind of starting out to a little bit of setup and prep I think will help you to kind of. You know, feel a little bit more in control How does that sound to you."
10773.0,Patient,That sounds good. i'm willing to try anything.
383.0,Provider,"yeah and if you need to use the medication, right now, for you know to kind of buffer yourself that's that's Okay, you know you don't need to feel badly about that."
10773.0,Patient,that's a hard line yeah.
383.0,Provider,yeah I don't know if you do feel badly about it but.
10773.0,Patient,"I do, because I want, I felt like I was making such a big leap, you know they're just taking half of the pill, and not even taking it first thing in the morning, I would you know I would do the change of my routine. And then, if I needed half a pill, I would take a pill, but I would give myself that you know change of routine first and see you know how much I could do, on my own. Before I gave in to taking that. And how I feel you know i've take a whole just to get through."
383.0,Provider,"And you want to just roll you know right now it's kind of like you've hit your in down going down the river and your journey and you've hit some some rapid so you know it's getting a little stormy. And so Okay, you know I got it, you know pull some of my from my tool kit you know some medicine, because this is this is kind of. Throwing me off a bit here and that's okay that's because you are in a more stressful situation it's it's to be to be understood, you know. yeah yeah. So um let's get our next appointment on the schedule."
10773.0,Patient,"Yes, please."
383.0,Provider,"weeks is Tuesday. The fourth do you feel like you can make it till then or do you want an appointment next week. I can see you next week, if you would like, I have a one on flawless to. Have a one o'clock on the 28th or we can two weeks will be the fourth. The connections, a little bit spotty right now."
10773.0,Patient,"Okay, how about. 28."
