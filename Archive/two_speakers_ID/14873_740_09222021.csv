When right before age five when I was an infant and then I also have memories of my grandfather. sexually abusing me and I had two older sisters who are really verbally and emotionally abusive so.

I used to pretend that I came from I didn't know, I was pretending I will tell people I came from this really affectionate wonderful loving family and I I just remember saying that, even though it was not true, I really seem to believe it when I tell people. I thought that was something I thought there was something wrong with me because I didn't have any memories or anything so I just so I better like act confident because I had something wrong with me."
740.0,Provider,"Know there's nothing wrong with you a lot of times when you think the real trauma you just block it out, so I mean the memory is there, but you just basically blocked it out. yeah because of hathaway the trump was."
14873.0,Patient,"i'm just saying when I was young, when I was. Because I didn't have my memories I just that was the massive with me why am I, like this, you know yeah. So, I guess, I still carry that sometimes you know, and I get triggered."

740.0,Provider,"Okay, oh what are some things you want to work on why you here and treatment."
14873.0,Patient,"I don't really I mean. The reason why I like working from home is because I often find when I work with other people like on day in, day out there tends to be like some there was always seems to be some dysfunction and. But sometimes you know, I have to i'm trying to get a job, where I can work from home. I find it difficult to. Fake it I tried to fake it that i'm willing to be submissive and stuff to a boss, but eventually it doesn't work. Then. They find out who that I don't get you know when I was much younger I used to tell people pleaser. and I never got fired and since I got you know a lot of recovering. I saw you can find because I just found it very difficult to. Have people tell me just just authority figures I mean, I have the honor I have, I want to be an entrepreneur, but I don't have enough confidence to market myself or speak in public so i've been a dilemma."
740.0,Provider,What would you be an entrepreneur What would you say.
14873.0,Patient,Oh i'm a writer. For on proposals for nonprofits and schools and municipalities and the last couple of years I started in copywriting for like Internet coaches.
740.0,Provider,Oh wow.
14873.0,Patient,"But if I mean I know if I was if I didn't have my what I went through, I think I will be like this person who could go out and market themselves, but I just makes me want to cry just i'm coming I can feel it. I feel like a because my girlfriend is like has mentored me and she and i'm working for a couple of her clients and you know they really love my work, but I am. You know I see other people go out and market themselves and stuff and she's helped me with marketing, but I have such a block that I I just you know, I just want to get referrals. You know I do I don't get enough to make you know enough money to live. I mean I charge a high hourly rate, but that might get my self esteem up to over the years to get like a high on that I don't have enough hours. Looking."
740.0,Provider,forward to block the block. block.
14873.0,Patient,"um. Well, I just know when I try my friend, like crowd is kind of my mentor my business mentor she had she wanted me to go to like this networking group, and so I had to stand up and give it like a 62nd pitch and initially really, really hard and then eventually I got used to it but um. I haven't had the thought and i've i've even run groups for Foundations like communications groups for like. The annenberg and going up, but when i'm sitting down and facilitating i'm fine, but when I have to stand up and everyone's looking at me, I mean i've given some presentations so traumatic When I think back, like all took a class. i'm. Standing up like with a PowerPoint presentation, something is. If it was something why I mean i've done a lot of 12 steps if it was something that was like my book, my novel that i'm working on I probably wouldn't feel I probably would have a lot more confidence because it's me being authentic. And i've had to do stuff, for you know it. Just it's just so traumatic When I think back like an alternate like people who know me will look at me and be shocked, because I turned into like piece of words like I have no personality and they're just like what happens, you know that's. When i'm not comfortable, so I have a lot of you know so yeah."
740.0,Provider,The wall.
14873.0,Patient,"I don't have social anxiety, I just have it went when I tried when I have to do, like any kind of public speaking so i've avoided it and I tried toastmasters. toastmasters things decades ago, so. Now this fails to smells weather like about sales and a very shallow and and I wrote a speech codes falling in love with yourself. And they were. Like looking at me like I was from another planet and it was so I just don't have a lot of I don't have the experience of having stood out. Well, I shouldn't say that I guess I did do the networking group or I didn't do the presentation and I think it was Okay, because people are very supportive of each other. But. If they don't know me and stuff and I just for writing code like code lasses like calling people called it's just. I can, I can do, I can look at other people, but for me to not get myself. with people who don't know me and it's like. it's completely cold like if it's like a referral then i'm fine. But I just. i'm finding a job interview, so I haven't gotten any so they must be they will talk about working in a team working as a team collaboration and. I don't fucking want to work as a team, and I want to write I don't want people you know I i'll give you my stuff but I don't want you to wordsmith me and stuff for me all was netflix stuff that's not a good just for the ego so I just have, I guess, I have problems. I had problems in the workplace yeah. You know people think that they can write like a CEO because i've been hired as a senior proposal right so and then they treat me like a junior. So i've gotten fired from the last few. Long term projects and. yeah I just didn't get along with the boss I didn't feel respected so I for me it's all about if I feel this don't. Like if i'm getting better but, like, I had the Road rage thing really bad it's somebody cut in front of me I would get incensed. And I think it's from my sister's like not being abused my my sisters i'm just and I would home console and much better, but it's still have been working on it for a long time, but if I feel disrespected. Like last week or where they didn't have like you know it wasn't on the calendar, or of the therapist in the group therapy was just awful and didn't just I felt worse after i'll. i'll just go to that place of like how fucking dare you because the way I was treated as a child was so horrendous. That any. Anyone who tries to disrespect me feels like they're disrespecting even though it's probably not personal. I can just use that."
740.0,Provider,"So what definition of dishes what does it look like, for you."
14873.0,Patient,"um well like I mentioned, like in my last. job that didn't last long, I mean it's I worked remotely so that's my ideal together, like a part time or full time job right what from us remotely the CEO was like really love my writing I did he was like oh you're amazing we want you, but then, when I actually worked on a proposal. I edited some of her work and she and everyone's like oh you don't edit her work she's the end she know she wasn't a great idea that she thought she was. And then, and then I lost the job because somebody edited out something that I rather like I wrote certain percentage of people lived in below the federal. A certain percentage of pete of renters in a in an area live below the the federal poverty level. And they took out renters, and so the client was like you know what are you talking about this is completely wrong, and I said I somebody took out what I wrote, so I, so I got fired because somebody took that renters they were like there are you know they don't all live."
740.0,Provider,"Janata me, and so it was like."
14873.0,Patient,"I have, I have confirmation of. You know. Just being hired as a professional reiser and then just being treated like. You know you're just going to change my."
740.0,Provider,smoker incompetent.
14873.0,Patient,"Not incompetent, but then i'm like a junior like I was treated when I was really young you know, like as if, like. so that you know I I was the last few jobs i've really tried to fake it pretends how I, you know that I time. But like I bet so so I got five for some it's something that I didn't do. Any way."
740.0,Provider,"To express it in which they do, they do, they face value, was like."
14873.0,Patient,"It was like buy it was like what. Because they think they said they probably wouldn't get the grant now because of me. You know, of course, like I said I didn't said wrenches and they had already decided. I guess, I guess, a lot of my. career stuff and what."
740.0,Provider,Word actually saved from his famous from. traumatic childhood.
14873.0,Patient,"yeah i'm pretty sure I mean yeah I think you know the weird thing is, I think it's almost like I discovered that I think that it's really the abuse from my sister's that has affected me in my day to day life today. Well it's kind of like I was, I was the youngest of three girls and I was you know, and I was like my sisters were like the wicked stepsisters and Cinderella they were just. awful to me and and I figured out over the years that. My middle sister admitted that she'd been sexually abused, but then went back and said she hadn't I my older sister, who was like really abusive to everybody. You know, called me when I confronted the family, and she said well you never touched me so what makes you so special. That climate and when my father died my mother called me in the middle, the night but he's dead now you happy, you know what I mean so it's like. No, just like no. You know that's where I come from, you know so when people did nice things to me, I was like I couldn't bear it to like do something good back for them. Because it's like if my sister ever did anything you better pay us back you know it was just. So yeah I guess my sisters they."
740.0,Provider,Are they still alive.
14873.0,Patient,I believe so.
740.0,Provider,"You keeping me speak with him, no. So. It seems like a lot. they're. performing my favorite. What are you what's your actual papers, right now, what are you what have you been working on."
14873.0,Patient,"I don't look I have many years, and so I just call her mind things happen, like, I had a fight with my best friend. And I told her, she. Was breaking out with me and I was you know really traumatized because she's like like the person I love most in my life and. And so i'll i'll call her when I get really tricky about something. didn't work on an ongoing basis with her anymore. And I used to. Face need to call her a lot more, but I do a lot of meditation and visualization so I don't need. I don't need as much as I used to just when I get really triggered. Like I got really triggered like last week. When when. You know when when the account when I wasn't booked with you, I got. I had a complete meltdown already complete now, though, because First there was the therapist in the group who didn't give me any self care stuff she just I told her what was going on with my friends, so we are you should just reflect on that, like what the Fuck is that. I."
740.0,Provider,clicked on it.
14873.0,Patient,"He said, and then with everybody else, she was saying yeah this is some self care things in here and i'm like like I put a message in and said. You know I didn't give me any stuff castings I don't know what it means, and she just said, I got my ambition just brushed me off. And so, when I when I wasn't booked with you, I that's when I lost that because i'm like are you fucking kidding me because I just I think traumatized reach traumatized by to. horrendous therapists and we like to the point where my ex my current therapist would say i'm amazed that you need and came back to therapy."
740.0,Provider,"And you know, often when you're going through with these."
14873.0,Patient,"therapists but I figured you know know corpus and think a lot of therapists. You know, because that working through them and I, my sister parties therapist my middle sister. That I just. googled and i'm like she's a fucking therapists you kidding I know how section is so anyway. But I do believe in therapy I just. I just."
740.0,Provider,"um yeah I don't agree traumatising patient I don't agree with you, moving patients are making you feel it's me, I mean. I don't know every week so. yeah hopefully. you'll be able to get something out of there to here. So you're not saying that they didn't want them."
14873.0,Patient,"um I just like I said, like, I think I was calling her like once every three weeks, and then it became like once every six weeks and then it's like once a month it's like I said, whenever something comes up that I don't feel I can do, on my own I can turn around on my own."
740.0,Provider,"Okay. How open, are you. With dealing with the trauma."
14873.0,Patient,"I lived out with that, like i'm 63 now i've dealt with it, since I was 29."
740.0,Provider,"And I mean properly deal with it, to the point to where it's not spilling over into other areas of your life."
14873.0,Patient,"yeah i'm really open. I mean. I would you don't do em Dr days. Oh okay that might be good. i've done i've done it I did it years ago, for you know the incest and stuff and I don't even know if it really works I don't even know because it's hard to know if you'd be a certain way, with or without something you know what I mean it's hard to. I don't know if I do the MDF for my sisters."
740.0,Provider,"So I may just. Everything things crazy it's just this one is not a reward for your family life, it would just between the ancestors, and the verbal emotional abuse. I mean that's just that's a lot, and so what happens is is that you, you you take that and then you carry it over into your adulthood, and so now it's affecting every area of your life and I had just recently had a group and I had a lady in the group, and she said. All yeah miss I dealt with i've dealt with, she said same thing you say Madrid I dealt with, I did with all my stuff I didn't deal with, so I fit. And busy there's a difference in dealing versus dealing properly. So if if if a hating me they will come will come to your House. and say hey. Miss Ruth is there with the same problem and and everything of good and they you turn on the St. And in water just going anywhere. So it's not saying that he didn't deal with it, is that he didn't deal with it properly enough to be the face of. The business dealing with something versus. Dealing with it properly. For it to be sick less that's the best part we're trying to get it for 86 i'm not saying in regards to that. And I tell people this all the time to deal with trauma it has nothing to do with forgetting that the trauma happened, but what it does have to do is is being able to live this fight for trump. and not allowing it to leak over into our daily lives because eventually you're saying once you fully so once you fully surrendered and once you actually properly deal deal with it, then it becomes it becomes so much easier to handle and it won't leak into your life."
14873.0,Patient,"As much of the hair. I think. Sorry. I think it's mostly my sisters and I didn't deal with I dealt with like my memory I dealt with. I feel like it's mostly my sister's their abuse and like. yeah like I remember staying with my sister in in a bed at my grandmother's house and it was giant bed, and she would look out she looked over she said Look how much room, you have and I literally was right at the edge. Just look up much room you're taking out, it was like I couldn't even. I couldn't even take up space, you know what I."
740.0,Provider,"mean, so I."
14873.0,Patient,"just tried to be invisible so that I wouldn't get more abused by them. So I feel like I worked through that I i'm a million times more confident. Like when I first went to UCLA. And I had to say my name out loud when I first came to America they went, we never did that in England back then. And I was so petrified just to say my name out loud. that's how far it's come."
740.0,Provider,"that's amazing I mean we never want to not honor the strides. that you have made from many years ago to now, I think that you've made them great five to 10 may solve what I hear. However, like the emotional trauma Hamburg, which I mean emotional abuse and verbal abuse also contributes to trauma everything can reach I mean trauma is different right, and so, even if you deal with the interface. Within spiel have a hard time. navigating through the verbal any most of us from your sisters that can also feel affect how you move forward, I mean look you shout out. You can start your own business with them at the same time you got them in your ear fairly big method in which she wants to see in other kind of stuff and so you know it's kind of like living life. it's not a live live in life, but not to your fullest potential. Because it seems like you get what you need if things like that you are a credible human being and that people actually value your work. And then you're really, really, really, really good at what you do, however, the only people that have see there is only people they may be made that you may get referred to, but I mean no one knows the population of people in California up and around the world would never really know. The ultimate. Significant than your work. yeah yes, and because of the fact that you don't put yourself out there, because of the self esteem not seeming like you're good enough. And so we'll deal with it. We will do that. Because. As 1662 years old, is necessary. And the thing about it is a you know what scares me i'm is Ruth is this, I would say what trips me up but shows me out of the people, the people, the people who verbally abused emotionally abused, they don't even think about this stuff no mo."
14873.0,Patient,"Oh, I know."
740.0,Provider,"They just move on with a life and and don't think twice as bad and then you bring it up, they act like they don't remember. And are they kind of so all I did a good family life yeah yeah you know they they they do all they kind of stuff and very dismissive. With the point, and so what we're trying to do now is that because of the fact that they're not focusing on it. And they're living there, everything live productive lives, then that's our that's our goal is to for you not to focus on it and and for a massive leap into your everyday life and your career. So that's a little work on that's the goal of it. Okay i'm not saying that it's not saying that it didn't exist. Because now what we're saying, but the thing about it is, is that is carrying over and you're focusing on it too much. And when I say you're focusing too much, I mean is leaking out to the point where like you say even in regards to disrespect when people. Question your work, or they also your work, or they modify your work or things like that not being able to. Do proper presentation before people without freezing up and because of the fact that what was told to you as a child, and you know, believe in yourself as much as you should, and all this kind of thing, and so it is eventually we come to a point where enough is enough. And so, hopefully, what I mean."
14873.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"When I say, nevertheless, which."
14873.0,Patient,"I mommy i'm sorry I didn't yeah yeah. yeah I had a relationship, since my husband was a sex addict and it's going to. take more time and so. Since then, I haven't had like a really a really healthy long term relationship, and I really. I know I know people have gone through trauma and incest, who in happy marriages and it's like how is How is that possible, because I get very, very, very possessive. And that's just one of the traits one of the triggers that comes out. But if I was with somebody who was really loving being so secure I don't think I would be like that."
740.0,Provider,"And the reason why it's possible is because of the fact that they've been able to deal with it and the thing about it is they face, and when I say. Because what happens is that a lot of times, where we undergo trauma, just like verbal abuse and emotional abuse and things like that is there, we allow work with these people have said to shape our our identity and our livelihood, to the point to where is really, really holding you back. And these people are constantly running facing your hair so free like your sisters don't even have to pay to be your here, they just already there is always in there. So the thing about it is. And that's why I say enough is enough because we've issued get to the point to where it is in, though. Like i'm not going to live what you say, control my life anymore i'm not going to live, how you treated me dictate what i'm going to do, move forward and then you have to speak and proclaim both of affirmations. And that's something that that's something that I would challenge you to do is to start writing down self affirmation. For every negative thought there should be an affirmation. To counter the thought right for everything that they say, there needs to be an affirmation to counter that the counter what they say, because the thing about it is, is that you have proven. A podium say you have proven throughout your life that you can be successful. You know i'm saying and the thing about it is, is that you are somebody I don't care what the people I don't care what they say. Everybody you taken those space that's good you're meant to take place in the world, you don't say you're missing have your space and the thing about it is that no one. You don't finish should be able to take that away from you, however, if that's if that's not how it's going even if they're still taking away from game they're still taking away for you, because."
14873.0,Patient,"I don't think of them at all. I mean I. I don't think Oh, this is why I mean i'm i've done work on it, but I don't think Oh, this is because of that my just."
740.0,Provider,"No, not thinking of them, I would say the word."
14873.0,Patient,"In what they said, or just the way they cheated, and I don't I don't look back and think Oh, the reason i'm like this is because of this, I just i'm just in the bad experience I don't think. You know I mean I get triggered."
740.0,Provider,But you don't connect the dots together.
14873.0,Patient,Not in the moment no not.
740.0,Provider,"yeah you'd be surprised how much. contributes today and then sometimes like I say we do we do avoid and we're just shut up and say Oh, it is a bad experience. Oh, it was just part of life know something."
14873.0,Patient,"I don't do that yeah that's what yeah. that's, why not being disrespected and stuff because I. treated so badly. That that's why I think I. I mean, I would love to just be neutral, you know. yeah. I don't want somebody changing my writing is when they make it worse. Because I don't want you to think i'm just like. don't you dare touch me i'm not like that."
740.0,Provider,"it's just like, no, no, no, no. I mean you work hard, or something you wrote and you wrote it of course you don't want to want to come in and change yourself, I mean I was a Grad student once upon a time, and it consisted of our papers. So I wish my visible come in and change any of my words, I will feel some type of way about it, too, I think it is more so i've been able to constructively communicate. and go off as to the point where you lose your job."
14873.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I like I said I faked it the last few times. I didn't go off the edge, they just fine. So I don't even want you to have to fake it we working on being genuine. yeah."
740.0,Provider,"yeah. I mean, I mean."
14873.0,Patient,"The two clients that I have they just are like oh my God, this is so amazing I just made $100,000 from this webinar that you did and. So. When people have put down my rice and i'm so I wrote for the La times I wrote for the leaders and cheryl they never touched the word thing i've changed the word of what I wrote so like. So I have built up I just don't want you to think that I haven't come like the huge way, I mean. Like I remember being in a in a 12 step group to insert survivors like hundred years ago, and there was a girl who had ritual abuse. And she said I had to climb up to get to self esteem to low self esteem and that's why always stayed with me, because you feel so nothing and worthless that. You know, so I I really gained a lot, but my friend keeps saying you have people problems i'm like I don't have people problems I just don't want to work with horrible people."
740.0,Provider,"mm hmm. yeah I don't I don't I don't take away or discredit any of your progress, I say, based on what you told me and based on what I read you come to mind in long way. And so, basically all i'm trying to do is get you to the finish line, considering that you've already ran a majority of race. You know my my objective is just to just to give you their lifeline and they boost and they got to that you can be everything that you desire to be. If an entrepreneur is what you desire and you don't want people dictating how you can do things that you want to be your own boss. You know, then then let's see how let's see what we need to do to get there let's see what we need to let what we will kind of thought, we need to eliminate. That is hindering us from getting their stuff like that I will never ever take away your progress, and neither will have neither will I fail to acknowledge that you have made progress, they are very aware. That you've made a lot of progress myself what I have written what you've told me, and so I think it's amazing that you've been able to overcome so much. And and being able to be the person that you are today and continue to strive my thing if you want to be a business on. You went on your own business that you've had a real, are you tired of people trying to run your life and like even with the option of contracting out, you know. See when you run your own business you're able to contract out and then we'll end the thing about it is that they have to end before they even. before they even utilize your services they have to sign a contract and one of the things you can put in the contract that do not modify the work. Do not also the writing you know anything about is you can do that why because it's your business you i'm saying is so many perks. In owning your own, and so I want, I want to at least try this issue. With the residue of what you have left of the the the residue they have not healed or the residue there this discuss this kind of peeking into you know you're not being able to live up to what you're trying to do in life that's all i'm trying to do, I just want to get rid of the residue. You got ready to train, but you got it got scrapped left over, you know, sometimes you get a little scraps on the floor after you don't swear up and you start to get them out, and they seem like they don't want to get into those fans that support, I want to give you the result is. Nice. So that's the will continue to work on and like I said i'm here to meet your need whatever you need from me, I will try my best I don't tend to be perfect, neither do I claim to be. Excellent I don't claim to be mentally kind of stuff i'm going to do the best I can, and we just wrote again."

You know, and you know a lot of times because of the pain that we heard in the past, telling us that will never be good enough and it kind of stuff. Sometimes, when we try to do new things or risky things are things that we know, is a huge race then we'll pull ourselves back because well, and then we get all these What if questions or if i'm a. What if I fail, you know they say somebody is the seventh floor of people that are seven floors they they don't make a pass it but would it be where the finance don't come to whatever I get out there and you're gonna buy don't want to hire me. Listen you don't know what the you know. ya know. It consider it vigil work has been dynamite.

They go through classes and they get started, they pay the money there are seven floors. you'll say they're able to notarized whatever, but at the same time, they have a faithful in what they notarized and what they don't. They have a safe Oh, and how much they you know how much they earn so my fish why i'm because that's their business. And so we want to I want you to get to the place the way you feel confident confident enough to put yourself out there. So that no one so then no one will ever be able to butcher your writings and what you do again because what you're saying, where you come to my bases, that means that means you're signing on to what I do you don't change what I do you know i'm saying.
