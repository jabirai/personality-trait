ID,Role,Message
105.0,Provider,Sullivan. apologize for my tardiness.
2474.0,Patient,No problem.
105.0,Provider,Alright need anything last minute before we dive in.
2474.0,Patient,"i'm know, I have a meeting at nine today so we'll have to end right on time."
105.0,Provider,sounds good. um let's see so. anything new.
2474.0,Patient,"um well. I guess the the biggest thing um I um. I watched you this um robotics workshop thing at at. That school um it. Is this thing on on Wednesday nights I went to last night, for the first time um and it's just kind of like. I guess the idea is to like. create a you know do some sort of robotics project for a competition but it's like open to anybody, and so I think I think i'm going to keep going, I think it might be a good way to just interact with people like it's in person and um you know and kind of. So yeah I think that that went well I you know talk to a few people last night and. So I. I was, I was happy that that I pushed myself and what."
105.0,Provider,yeah me too cool. And do you know anything about robotics or.
2474.0,Patient,"No, no it's. It says that you know you don't have to have any experience."
105.0,Provider,fun. Did you ever watch that show where they would have that.
2474.0,Patient,Little box.
105.0,Provider,yeah did you ever watch that.
2474.0,Patient,yeah that's.
105.0,Provider,The only thing I know. I really liked it um. it's interesting it doesn't have to be the fanciest one for sure you know it's uh. it's pretty cool.
2474.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I think it also would. You know, go well with with the the programming class i'm taking this semester and. You know there'll be some overlap there, hopefully."
105.0,Provider,"Which days of the week, is it."
2474.0,Patient,Oh Wednesday nights and nights.
105.0,Provider,"And not too far, of a drive."
2474.0,Patient,Know it's. Maybe 15 minutes from here it's not. albuquerque is kind of spread out but it doesn't really ever. take too long to get anywhere because traffic's not that bad usually.
105.0,Provider,"And you're still finding your your work, rewarding enough you're not needing to make any change there."
2474.0,Patient,"um. well. You know I think at this point I would be. Pretty. Pretty bored with work if it was the only thing on my plate um you know, since there's a lot of downtime during the day i'm able to get a lot of school work done during the day um so that's kind of. So so i'm happy with the situation because it works well with school but but yeah I think that. If it weren't for that the job itself but probably not engaging enough to. To be totally satisfied."
105.0,Provider,"But it's perfect right now, it just works out. yeah Nice."
2474.0,Patient,"At least as long as we're able to keep working from home if we go back to in person driving up to Santa fe would make things complicated might have to make a change at that point, but that doesn't seem like that's going to happen. and"
105.0,Provider,"I, and I just so wonder if we have forever changed the landscape of what normal is for work. Just."
2474.0,Patient,"Yes, like one of those things like. Compared to something like school, which is so important for kids to be like in school like work, everyone has been functioning pretty well like working remotely for so I like why I take the risk at this point. from home."
105.0,Provider,"yeah it seems like it would benefit. The employer smaller office space, you know it seems like it, you know because i've been listening to the business real estate market is like freaking out. Because he for the very reason I just said, you just don't need that infrastructure, you know."
2474.0,Patient,So yeah it's true.
105.0,Provider,"affecting the real estate, in that way. So Hausa are you still on the tracks on."
2474.0,Patient,"Just because they said I am I still on. naltrexone yes, yes, I am. i'm. It. it's hard to say exactly what it does um you know I haven't tried any opiate since I started it how effective it is blocking them but. What I would say is that. I. You know i've had no more problem or possibly even less craving since I switched naltrexone then, when I was on suboxone so. So that's that's interesting you know it's. I think. i'm not sure how much to attribute to the attacks on but I, you know, since since going from that tiny amount to stopping completely it hasn't like increase any issues with you know me having cravings for updates or anything so i'm happy about that."
105.0,Provider,"me too. And do you have a sense of are you just fluid with the idea of how long used to want to stay on it, do you have a target date just checking in on that."
2474.0,Patient,"Well, I mean. When I when I had originally started it, I was. I was thinking you know, probably stay on it for a relatively long period of time, I know that that's. Something some people do. um it was it was interesting though, what. What the doctor is saying about it, potentially blocking so natural domain and that sounded like she didn't she herself wasn't recommending doing it for like a real extended period of time started the impression I got. So i'll talk to her again more at the next group about it but, but she had said, you know originally it sounded like she was recommending maybe I do it for three months, I think I want to want to keep going longer than three months but i'm not. I don't have an exact answer for. The nda i'm going to just have to talk to the doctor more about that."
105.0,Provider,"But your concern is surrounding primarily whether it's it's inhibiting the the natural domain production from your daily life, and is it is, it also that. sense of safety for you."
2474.0,Patient,"um well that's that's definitely. Why. I. I like the idea of staying on it it's like started gives that same kind of. You know added safety, you know that that you know the suboxone did where it's like well, even if I were to you know run into someone who I haven't seen in years hey here's some dope you want to get high I like it, I wouldn't be able to and, and that is reassuring um it's like. it's I i'd like to think that even if if it weren't for that i'd be able to say no i'm good okay now but, but like having that added. You know. knowledge that there's, not even a point to it. is reassuring."
105.0,Provider,"Then, if that changes, then. i'll make some changes. How are you assessing your sense of inter personal confidence."
2474.0,Patient,"well. I guess. I think. i've been making. Making slow but but steady improvements on that front. um I um. I guess I, I think that. I. um you know just some of the experiences i've had with you know, like with that. The robotics thing last night, or you know with. You know, like that that hiking group I went to um. You know it those. Like there's definitely like this, this level of nervousness and you know worry about. You know I don't know I, but you know I still definitely like. Was was like nervous about going and interacting with people last night um. But. um. yeah. Like I forced myself to do it anyways it was it was kind of rewarding it was you know nowhere near is. I was nowhere near as stressed out as I, you know was picturing myself before. You know, it was you know as definitely. um. You know. Like a little like little awkward and like approaching people and stuff I didn't like start like. You know, a bunch of like individual conversations or anything but I, you know, I was able to like talk to people about what their interests were, and you know, like the group, like why we're there and stuff so. um. I guess what i'm getting at is it just like made me realize that. it's kind of like I think. sort of like maybe like it came to working out like i've got to like just keep pushing myself to be in those situations. In order to improve my outlook situation. So, so I think that i've been. That that's been you know positive. And that you know that that was a positive revelation, but I think I need to definitely keep keep pushing myself i'm not not where I want to be yet either. Like i'd like. i'd like to have more interpersonal confidence still I think building some but not not quite at the goal yet."
105.0,Provider,"Like any muscle right. yeah. Getting it to be, maybe over time, more of a ritual and habit and you can just sort of walk in any situation and. Whatever happens happens."
2474.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Is this biggest challenge, would you say you know in those moments, where you were in a social setting. What would you say the biggest challenge is, you know, for some people they'll say you know I couldn't think straight that was going to pass out or. Maybe some perception of how other people were seeing you. sort of a ticker tape you know this tape gun running through of what is it they're thinking they're thinking this like know what what's the barrier would you say really the big one, this just take this example on Wednesday going there."
2474.0,Patient,"it's kind of hard. To put into exact words um I guess. there's this like. there's this like. Persistent fear I guess of like. me doing something. That then causes me to not be accepted by the group, like i'll say like i'm worried i'll say something stupid or like it just get caught up. In. Like. I guess done the analysis of my own actions in the situation, as opposed to just engaging I think a lot about how engaging. creates this like spiral sometimes."
105.0,Provider,Did you notice anyone say anything stupid.
2474.0,Patient,"not know I mean it was. No, I did not get that impression it. Like."
105.0,Provider,"No, I made a bad joke and dumb one that was like not that funny."
2474.0,Patient,"um. Well, I mean. I guess i'm. Like. It was sort of like. I mean the. I don't I don't have a memory of that now, I mean, I think that. I mean there is definitely. A spectrum of you know, the questions are being asked somewhere like from people who are knew a lot about you know programming and robotics and I like really like. You know, questions that were over my head and then there was stuff that. Was super basic, on the other side, so um but I don't feel like there's any anyone, he said something that was just like oh my God, who is this person. Has that like you know even like the more simple questions are all reasonable I think like as far as I remember his list. um. yeah I don't know what else to say. it's like what I mean that. That like fear of judgment is like something that. I don't know why I have it to such a degree, because. At least in my adult life it's never really been something i've. Ever felt like actually had a problem with in person it's like something I worry about but i've never like actually I don't think that, in a situation as an adult or like oh yeah. everyone's talking about how stupid, I am or whatever, why they come it's like something like this fear, I have never it's totally irrational but. yeah I don't know."
105.0,Provider,"And so that may indeed just live as an implicit memory. So anything that smacks of it you're not you don't have a narrative for it, the sooner, you can get a narrative for it, where instead it is oh. This is my healing story around this feeling, when you have that instead. I think it will be experienced differently. Think you'll be able to go in really in your adult body only go into settings like whoa Well done, where that came from there, it is and you'll have you'll have a new story which I don't know that you have it, yet I listen I don't think you've got it yet. And you're identifying you know you're like doesn't stand up to right brain logic and reason. i'm assuming you can say things i'm just as smart just as attractive, just as I can walk I can do as basically anybody else you kind of fall right in there right that's that about true. or even smarter or spending your somewhere in that range or no."
2474.0,Patient,"yo yeah I mean. Like I never. I never like feel like. Insufficient if i'm like comparing myself. To like someone who has like who's that like. Has like similar experience to me or something um I guess when it's like. Where I get get caught up as like tying myself like oh man I you know i'm. Like i'm older than these people, yet they have you know way more experience with this and they're like you know. A worry that I had last night at least before going. So. it's a. yeah."
105.0,Provider,you're comparing yourself to them.
2474.0,Patient,"yeah I guess that's kind of. The problem, maybe I mean, I know that there's not really a point to do that, but it's like hard not to do."
105.0,Provider,"amen still it is worthwhile. Well, just sort of take it from an extreme and say, well then. You know how dare you be there, you know how do you answer that how dare you be there. what's your answer to them. Not overthought through your first response and not carefully weighed one."
2474.0,Patient,"Just. That like it's. that's a. I should be there because i'm. The target like it's you know it's it's a. workshop that's open to anybody, so you know that's a place to gain experience, so I shouldn't feel ashamed for not having experience going into it."
105.0,Provider,So pushing that further. If you had crashed. A workshop. That was for advanced understanding and experience. What would be your explanation of. How dare you be there.
2474.0,Patient,guess that. was interested I don't know.
105.0,Provider,"i'll stay there i'm, I was interested okay."
2474.0,Patient,I didn't realize it would be over my head until I got here.
105.0,Provider,"i'm interested. that's that's what this life is about. comes back to you. If you weren't preoccupied with whether someone in an advanced class had an opinion of you, if you stayed more. again looking from out from your own eyes. You would boldly bumble along into whatever interested you. Do you just go Hello i'm here. blink blink. Right, which up to what's doing. But you feel those eyes on you."
2474.0,Patient,event those eyes on.
105.0,Provider,"yeah they are good yeah that's better yeah they because they're all going through the same thing that you are. Socially same thing just a matter of degree. and doing their best to just lead with curiosity and not get paralyzed with what will people think. And I here I am assuming, you know you're getting it's getting better, you can see that that's the dominant first response you have knowledge that fear is going to be there and going anyway, it has been key and I heard you say that earlier just have to go anyway. And it has never been as bad. As you're thinking has been."
2474.0,Patient,is probably probably accurate um.
105.0,Provider,Are you thinking of a time when it was bad.
2474.0,Patient,"well. yeah but it's like you know, like the times that I. Think are bad or like times when it was like a party or something that I went to and i'm. Just. You know I, I do have those memories of going to like a party and just feeling like totally isolated and like you know just cannot start a conversation with anybody, and you know. So. um. I mean, and I think that. You know that's. Certainly linked to you know to substance use or you know to. To be in in that kind of mind State makes me a lot more likely to to use something if that option is there. Maybe that's. that's part of you know. What makes me. nervous, or what adds to the the nervousness of other situations is. Because I know that when I have. felt. Like really awkward like that in the past i've dealt with it and unhealthy ways. But I mean even that is not exactly. Rational as long as I pick the events right it's not like. You know, someone at the robotics workshop is you know you want some cocaine like. it's you know that that's like a pretty specific thing that would not happen."
105.0,Provider,Is that is that a scenario that you would be vulnerable to doing to take conceding to relapsing.
2474.0,Patient,"I mean it's it's not. Not a situation I put myself in but it's definitely my biggest I think. Probably the. Something I need to be the most careful about I do worry like, if I were at a party and someone just offered me drugs they were there in front of me I would have a really hard time not doing them. I like to think that I got a little bit better self control now after the last two years, but I still am scared that I wouldn't. I haven't tested it I guess."
105.0,Provider,"Now, but you said it twice in two different ways today it's the Why then the locks on there was a there's a safety there. And now again talking about it here and I can't help but think you're on the right course right continuing to to see that it's safe to be in your body in the world of people. But that awkward. You still you do you look like you're awkward in your body you look like you don't want to be there. Does it feel like that."
2474.0,Patient,Sometimes yeah.
105.0,Provider,"What would happen let's just go with that what would happen if you did the extreme of that the other way and celebrated being in your body. And you went places just being like yeah i'm here. Well, we happen. first thought. Over thinker I gotta get you in them."
2474.0,Patient,Is this the first slide is that I mean i'm not sure how to do that.
105.0,Provider,Right so there's something to it we're onto something. And so. Drugs allow you to is it forget that you're in the body you're in.
2474.0,Patient,"i'm maybe i'm. I guess that's kind of. Another. way to describe it, maybe I guess I think of it more as like they. Make it, so I stop overanalyzing everything. Like. So. Like. which you know it's it's. it's it's kind of the same thing you know, like. yeah it's sort of like. I don't like being. not comfortable. Nothing being uncomfortable in my body and. You know. overthinking. All of my interactions with people are kind of. I don't know that they seem very similar. To me."
105.0,Provider,It feels similar.
2474.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I mean, I think that. Those. Those two feelings both coming from a similar place. and drugs have kind of wood. help. It is very helpful, it would make me think that they helped. You know dampen that those those anxieties."
105.0,Provider,"Earlier I was. sort of leading you to. To this place. Of. Like. of fundamental belief that. You. And I know we've said it before but it's so fundamental that you're okay. know that you can go to robotics workshop, and you could be the least informed and least experienced person in Rome. And that that doesn't. diminish your value. But I get the impression that, no matter what I tried to sell you one you would not buy that. Because you use this word insufficient earlier today. And you know kind of like. Maybe you have an opinion of kind of a moron you know that, why did you speak idiot you know, like oh if, like you have that of other people to. feel like you're an idiot, why are you talking. You know, and then so maybe you have that other people, and maybe maybe then other people might have it a view. Is that true do you think maybe you do judge other people."
2474.0,Patient,"Oh, I. definitely do I, I try not not to but I certainly. I mean. Even if I dismiss them, I certainly will have judgments that flash to mind a time stuff um."
105.0,Provider,"What do you see that if the ends there that then it could be simpler, it could be. What you do to yourself to. These people that are stupid now i'm just picking a couple words more on stupid. To kind of have a right to do. and enjoy and be interested in what they're interested in. Do you fundamentally believe that. That dumb people have rights to."
2474.0,Patient,"yeah no I mean I don't. Like. I. You know, like so like that what's coming to mind right now is like. This this guy who I work with do you know that. Like we have some things in common, but i'm. Like he's like really, really, really into nascar and I don't get nascar at all, and you know it's like it's totally it's totally cool like if that's what he's into like more power to him. But like when he starts talking about it, I can't help myself nascar really."
105.0,Provider,yeah yeah yeah.
2474.0,Patient,"And you know, then I let that go on, so you know cool like Miguel enjoys that good for him, but I still have that initial judgment so."
105.0,Provider,So you went like we're in stay a little bit longer there's something i'm interested in see like. Like do you. Find being around him a versus.
2474.0,Patient,"No, no. No, I wouldn't say that. he's. Sometimes a bit of I guess it confusing person to talk to you like I think his brain just works very differently. So, like sometimes we'll have like a conversation I feel like we're having two different conversations, but. I don't find them to be unpleasant or anything like it."
105.0,Provider,"stay with the physiology of it let's just do one more step here let's just see when you're around that this is a subject you're not interested in. What is it like to be physically around him yours, you know does do you have a visceral reaction to if you went like that, but what what happens when you just keep standing there listening to him carry on about nascar."
2474.0,Patient,"well. I mean, I get. To be like tense and. kind of like. fidgety um you know it definitely can can trigger kind of like. That kind of the physical reaction I get when I feel awkward it's like I I don't. Like I it's like I feel like I don't. it's like like a conversation that I just don't know. it's like. it's like I, I want to engage with him, but I don't want to engage about nascar and I i'm. So it's like I get this like. The physical reaction is like. Just this like tension that I think is like kind of like maybe a manifestation of me. Like wanting to try to. was just feeling awkward like feeling like I want to. Change the conversation, but not really being sure how to. Okay, or. Like wanting to engage with him and not knowing how to because the the path that he makes open for engaging with them it's not one. For."
105.0,Provider,You feel tense and fidgety and maybe awkward when someone's talking about something that you're not interested in and you're not sure what to do. That the nuts and bolts of it. I want to connect and what they're talking about something i'm interested in it.
2474.0,Patient,yeah I think that's. Accurate.
105.0,Provider,"you've been around people that didn't really dig what you were interested in you ever watch, can you picture someone being like yeah I don't know what to say to that."
2474.0,Patient,um. yeah I mean I definitely. felt like. yeah i've definitely been in situations where i've been you know really excitedly explaining something and salt lake city i'm explaining it to me.
105.0,Provider,Was you survived it obviously if you're talking about it. Did you feel offended by them.
2474.0,Patient,No. um.
105.0,Provider,"What would you have liked to have heard from them. to redirect but what would have been received well. Instead of you getting that third and fourth sense so to death, if you could hear a redirect What would you like to hear. And picture their face to face is looking like this and they might say what."
2474.0,Patient,"Hello. I guess. Any kind of redirect would. would probably be helpful, like. i'm. Now i'm talking to someone. At we don't want to just be boring them unless they they weren't."
105.0,Provider,What do you want to hear you're still have answered it what would you hear that wouldn't hurt your feelings that you could.
2474.0,Patient,i'm not really interested in this. house.
105.0,Provider,"Well, that one. it's interesting that one wouldn't that someone saying i'm not really interested in this that wouldn't rub you the wrong way."
2474.0,Patient,"I don't think so, and then. I guess it might depend what we were talking about but i'm. Like if it were just like something that are like a hobby of mine, like the. And I know I get a lot more obsessive about certain things you should do is I don't think I would be offended if someone said, like you know I don't have your same level of interest in this topic."
105.0,Provider,"What if we didn't use what if the word interest wasn't used because you're able to hear it. Because you interchange you know obsessed or invest or whatever the word is you just used a second ago but some people mistake that with the whole person not being interesting they identify very much with hobby so you don't. Based on your your what you just shared but you know there's for it, you can play with it a little bit more like I have not done my research on this topic, I don't have much to contribute to this. i've spent more time. You know in this field, you know and they you know. Do you know anything about that. You know don't know much about nascar you know. You really identify with with that sport it's neat I i'm I know more about like my curiosity is in sort of how does the engine work and my mind goes to you know the aerodynamics or you know, obviously i'm making this up, but my point is, you can start to talk about what interests you. Because if I say i'm not really interested in talking about. nascar can we talk about something else. The answers, yes, but what so you might as well put it in there, because now, someone has to decide what and it can be awkward. So, instead, you just do it, you just say don't have much never been not likely to go but dang you're really into it, you this passionate about anything else, I mean you, maybe go a couple times a year you go to rodeos do you go to you know any of the live music around here. You see how you're doing it versus having to sort of say. i'm not interested in this. You have the resilience for it. But not everyone would."
2474.0,Patient,"ya know like like yeah that's that's why I was having trouble answering that question because it's like. I don't think I would be offended if someone told that to me, but I don't think I could say that."
105.0,Provider,"yeah. But but it's really innocent. Innocent I don't know much about this subject, how about instead of not interested, I don't know much about it, I don't have much to contribute to this conversation and that's where we can use humor I you know. You can be playful. I don't know what to say to this. How about this other thing, and you just do it start talking about something or there might be an overlap. Would that be something you could experiment with."
2474.0,Patient,yeah. I think so.
105.0,Provider,"No, you need to jump out in here, so I just became pretty aware of time. So. Maybe. What are we doing at this point we'd like once a month."
2474.0,Patient,yeah yeah that sounds good. The February.
105.0,Provider,February 10th. Do that am and. yeah. People are there they're definitely they're not looking at you just to review their we're all wrapped up in our own little worlds you got a lot more room and then you realize. there's lots of room for you to just walk in and check out what interests you we're all just wrapped up in our own neuroses. If you do some of this experimenting please come back and tell me how you do i'd be curious to know you redirect OK.
2474.0,Patient,I will try. To put myself in situations right have that opportunity.
105.0,Provider,On the nascar then.
