408.0,Provider,Stuart habit has not yet checked in for his individual therapy session i'm going to pause the recording just notify the Stewart how that has checked into the vc.
16639.0,Patient,How are you man.
408.0,Provider,"Good and how are you, sir."
16639.0,Patient,Not too bad not your average day in my life.
408.0,Provider,"Okay, well, we are working problem, one which we contracted for last week after generating your problem, less problem one was procrastination and the solutions several were generated the one. group of solutions that you agreed to work on was to address one source of procrastination within your mobility limitations in doing emails and other communications that require typing. you're going to explore some additional voice recognition voice to text applications, because the one that you had been using was difficult to use. So we talked about a couple of them dragon rider was one, but there are many others, and you were going to try out dragon writer and or others that you might find out on your own when you were low thing so go ahead and tell me how that went."
16639.0,Patient,"Well um. What I did was um I think I may have mentioned that I have i've tried a variety of Apps and programs over over the distant past i've been frustrated, but I recently a couple of months ago I gotten were Microsoft word for windows 10. And I had noticed it had a dictate buttons. And I had not really done anything with it, but since we spoke, I have started practicing just on because it's integrated with the with the word program and it seems to be. doing a great job it didn't have a birth, the training. tutorials or whatever were limited but the accuracy is quite good. And i'm trying to read through and and and start to memorize some of the basics voice commands. How to do punctuation that's up I think it's going to help me I think it's going to help me a great deal."
408.0,Provider,"Here you I applaud your reality base here in. reminding yourself and knowing that it is a an effort it's a work its work right so as you say, it takes repetitive practice to learn how to use any new tool. But sometimes if you get frustrated, you can use cognitive restructuring, to remind yourself of what your goal is, which is to acquire. A new skill to use a tool that ultimately will help you reduce procrastination that's what we're working on and also hopefully improve communication, which will reduce social isolation, etc, etc, etc, a lot of things right."
16639.0,Patient,"We just checked the call right the. I think it's a survey here. Yes, and now another. In addition to the emails and internal communications, one of the things that has been very much in the Center of my life for for well three years, but particularly in the last several months is trying to complete a bigger project that is written. and Many different parts of it exists in some form but. You know I don't think I I guess it'd be a little bit like writing a book, although it's not a book as such, but just trying to get the chapters to mash and to get the final effect that I need it is actually a public interest lawsuit that i've been working on. That is extremely important to me and that that's my biggest challenge as far as I thought about after we spoke, that the email is a big part of it, but really this lawsuit is. Is everything to me and i've been very i've had a lot of anxiety over it, that that you know I, knowing that it wouldn't take much more than a stiff breeze to to derail me from it for good. I. I procrastinate and. And i've been working on it so long it's so hard to understand the depth of looking at it Oh, you must have done what are you at your a Dr site site clinical psychology is that right or."
408.0,Provider,i'm psychiatric social worker and researcher.
16639.0,Patient,I see okay okay um. yeah. I don't know I lost my train of thought there but yeah it's trying to turn my focus on to this thing I was doing pretty well before I got kicked out of my old Tele health ma T provider um I don't know if you recall any or.
408.0,Provider,"As I recall, the history that. Yes, you had related yes."
16639.0,Patient,"And that that was, I mean that 18 days off of suboxone was was and the whole event the whole. The whole series of events was very hard on a i've been kind of delicate out to start with, and i'm only starting to really bounce back. From the from the withdrawal effects that were were so bad and cause my digestion and my my my bladder situation which are nerds nerds Yannick and nature from my spinal injury. it's aggravated and complicated those things. And I just. i'm thinking you know my wife wanted me to go to Maryland weather for Christmas. And I said, you know I can't go back I had made a big command performance at my sister and memorial for my from my very close sister in Maryland. And I told i'm Sorry, I know I know we're not supposed to be talking about my personal problems but i'm in desperate need of some actual counsel on."
408.0,Provider,"Well, yes, we are actually that's part of therapy, but we choose and start with the problem solving therapy protocol and that's why we were we identified the first one is procrastination now are you saying that this is a new problem that you wanted to work on."
16639.0,Patient,"With regard to this, this project."
408.0,Provider,With regard to what you've introduced to topics now one lawsuit and what which is related to communication and writing. which show was relating to problem one and the other is going to Maryland. With your wife.
16639.0,Patient,"No that's right, I was. I hate just said to her yesterday I said I one of the problems I had is, I have a tendency to answer questions or make statements in very roundabout way, and people always think i've changed the subject, and whereas if they were a little bit more patient I would be able to bring it back. You know, to where I wanted it to be so I do, that a lot Okay, but my main point was that I told her that I had to either get this lawsuit filed war give up on it and I wasn't going to go to Maryland and leaving it under. After having a promise. promise my daughter, who is there, among others, that I would let nothing stop me from filing this thing it's, the most important thing, maybe i've ever done so that's yeah that's how it all relates. How do I get my yeah how do I get myself to focus using my limited budget of time and energy. Right, how can I turn my focus on to that."
408.0,Provider,"So let's bring this this in as well to our our solution that you are working on which is voice to text. Your voice to text is a tool. To assist you, with your mobility limitations now, this can apply not only to emails obviously once you get get facility with the device application that you selected you could use this to more quickly and easily complete the documents that you're referring to the legal documents."
16639.0,Patient,And the first next entry yeah.
408.0,Provider,"Right so let's that does pertain right if you find a if you find this tool and you work at learning this tool, and if you find it. Accessible right and also effective to do what you need to do in written communication, then this will reduce your procrastination on your legal document writing as well as your emails. Does that make sense."
16639.0,Patient,"It does make sense. Maybe. I was thinking, maybe the novelty of the voice recognition and finally getting some facility with that may be sort of a psychological way to get my interest up in the project again where it's just it's low some to me right now I don't love to work on it."
408.0,Provider,"But maybe with this so. So that's actually Another cause of procrastination, this is another cause so it's one cause is your mobility mobility limitation in writing, which we generated that solution right, but this is a new cause of the problem of procrastination which is negative emotion."
16639.0,Patient,hmm.
408.0,Provider,You said you find it low some.
16639.0,Patient,yeah.
408.0,Provider,"All right, so why don't we. Not to not that you're going to let go of working on the voice recognition application, you need to continue learning that okay. And I don't want to overwhelm you with too many too long to do list in therapy right because you're quite correct that realistically your lifestyle has to embrace realistic energy and mental focusing capacity. Right, otherwise it's going to be self defeating it's."
16639.0,Patient,Not work. So well I. say.
408.0,Provider,"let's refocus on the low slimness okay so let's make best use of our time here to get worked up. Alright, so what makes the lawsuit work process loathsome right now to you."
16639.0,Patient,"Well, I probably wouldn't have used that word, except that i've spent so many hundreds of hours on it and i'm tired of it, but I think one of the things with with procrastination I know that this. seems to be a fact. I I am fearful of starting work and hitting an unexpected obstacle or or or missing part or something and that i'll do worse because now i've actually started to work and hit a roadblock."
408.0,Provider,"Okay, so let me challenge that that's a self defeating belief system okay so within cognitive behavioral theory, so now i'm switching from Problem Solving to cognitive behavioral theory. So a self defeating belief system within cognitive behavioral theory is one that is a distortion, not that it's wrong it's just a little distorted, so that it becomes unrealistic and then it drives negative thoughts and negative mood and he roads motivation. Okay, does that make sense. Yes, alright so as one small piece to focus on with the low slimness right I love that word. Of the project is that you're afraid that working on it you're running into an obstacle that's a little distorted because realistically all projects all work all goals will encounter obstacles it's a given know. If you didn't encounter obstacles we wouldn't call it work."
16639.0,Patient,We call it a play.
408.0,Provider,Right.
16639.0,Patient,"But yeah but, but the other part of my the other part of that anxiety is that I kind of feel like i'm at the end of my i'm old before my time I mean I i've already survived longer than the 25 year life expectancy, I had when I had the injury. Right, I thought, if I could hold on till now, they would have cured spinal cord injury well that's not."
408.0,Provider,"be nice, although is i've suggested to you, Mr hemet yeah our treatment advances that you need to take advantage of like returning to work with a spinal cord specialist. Okay yeah but but let's leave that for a moment, so what i'm hearing you say is you're not so sure at this point in your developmental stage of life, your life phase of the life cycle that the legal project is quite so high priority, as it used to be."
16639.0,Patient,"it's not. it's just a massive project for someone with my limitations by my other problems in life it's just it's overwhelming, but it means everything to me if I go into if i'm on my deathbed and this didn't happen, I will not think very well myself."
408.0,Provider,"But I want to challenge that and, as you have it, because you just said, a minute ago that the whole that you've been repulsed disgusted. Actually sickened So the idea of loathsome mean something that's repulsive and disgusting. So this time you're saying this particular project. has become highly distasteful so that makes me circle back here and ask you again based on hearing that Is this the way you want to spend your quality time for the remainder of your life, however long it is."
16639.0,Patient,"By no means do I want to do that my hope is that this type of case, it has to be a federal class action lawsuit and there is a provision, where the Court can immediately appoint interim counsel for the class and I could just by filing it potentially get some relief. If I don't file it all that it's going to be a colossal missed opportunity and I will."
408.0,Provider,"examine, then what are the barriers to your filing it just the way it is now just with what documentation, you have now what's the barriers."
16639.0,Patient,"um i'd say it's probably fairly, it may be 60% complete complete being. The documents that I had in mind. I need to have already grasp that I need to lower the standards to the point where I can lob this through the words through the door that where they call it the. US has a windows over top of the doors throw it through the. You know what i'm talking about an old movies, you see the."
408.0,Provider,train the train oh.
16639.0,Patient,yeah I need to get it through the transom. And and and and that's going to have a blast to take this you know. 40 pages of text in three documents and and just crunch it down and tie up loose ends as best I can.
408.0,Provider,And so let's. To doing that.
16639.0,Patient,"right that goes. Okay, I kind of goes to the heart of my email problem as well, is that I can never find the end point. I compulsively edit re edit. that things are always longer than they should be i've always been this way, but at this point in my life it's become a real problem for me. I just need to get gone, but I have no support yeah my mom I love my wife dearly but she is not sympathetic to this cause and if she wanted to make."
408.0,Provider,"thing, and you know your daughter is."
16639.0,Patient,that's true.
408.0,Provider,Do you. think your daughter fight about it.
16639.0,Patient,"No, I don't think so, but my wife has amazing skills office skills. And she can make this happen so easily but she won't even acknowledge that i'm that i'm that i'm growing this enormous boulder up this this mountain."
408.0,Provider,She Figures it's not her problem buddy.
16639.0,Patient,"Our problem, and she doesn't support it and concept."
408.0,Provider,it's not a problem let's be.
16639.0,Patient,"Definitely yeah it's not it's not it's not a sport, I have no support only. A couple of close friends who couldn't help me if they tried."
408.0,Provider,"going to challenge you again, you said you have no support and yet you also said you had promised your daughter, you would do this project."
16639.0,Patient,Yes.
408.0,Provider,So where does the support from your daughter play into this.
16639.0,Patient,"Well, in terms of active support or actual life what you call clerical support I have Europe."
408.0,Provider,What what's what is what is driving that.
16639.0,Patient,um. What.
408.0,Provider,"So your daughter what's driving your daughter, not to work with you on. Since it seems to be so important to. her that she. Had you promised her that you would do it."
16639.0,Patient,"um I it's not that important or her in that sense, I promised her more along the lines of this is real that i've been talking about for the last three years, this is going to be big and I did, and I was swore that I would not let. That I would not fail myself she is sympathetic but i'm mostly trying not to fail myself, because I think that says real. Okay, but if you."
408.0,Provider,need help you also need help you said.
16639.0,Patient,desperately.
408.0,Provider,"yeah, so why not ask. At here's a solution while i'm brainstorming with you here, Mr hammond. Why not ask your daughter to come and help you with this project, you can share the documents with her and she can help you edit and merge them."
16639.0,Patient,"Right, it should even do it remotely."
408.0,Provider,exactly right that's what i'm saying that's what i'm saying. Every software that she. could do that with.
16639.0,Patient,"You know I. I have not maybe not brooch to tour in concrete terms but i've been dangling you know these. i've been dangling in front of her for a long time I don't think she feels that she has the time to get into something like that, with. me which will tend to be somebody that were that were that were monopolize her her limited time she's working."
408.0,Provider,"All right, yeah yeah so here's brainstorming solution number two your wife wants to go to Maryland for the holidays. You feel an obstacle to that is that you need to work on this legal project. How about as a solution, you go with her to Maryland for the holidays and you ask your daughter, to take two hours out of the holiday schedule to work with you on this legal project, while you're there, while you were there."
16639.0,Patient,While there has been a file development that is is. Similar by converse. She told us yesterday that she's going to try to come here on the 27th. to visit for a few days and and that could be ideal because she'll be away from everything um.
408.0,Provider,"And she's not going. To be in Maryland over the holidays, to visit with you and your wife."
16639.0,Patient,"No, no, no, I decided I couldn't go and and I encouraged her to get the missus to go without me, but she decided that she didn't want to do that. she thinks that that beeping the invalid, that I am that some prices fall, occur if she goes without me so so we have pretty much decided before gracie call us not to do the truck. So the I told you."
408.0,Provider,"All right, gotcha so you could work with her when she comes on the 27th yeah yeah which I guess in the in the realm of holidays, we could call it a Boxing Day project. 27th is the day after Boxing Day, you know what box."
16639.0,Patient,"But the 26 yes, yes, yes. Okay bye bye y'all my younger sisters married a Brit and they invite they have a place in Annapolis Maryland and we waited to visit them on Boxing Day to have their traditional. With a cold cold cut. yeah which is, which is me that have been from the holiday dinners are carved and eaten cold. My father, my father side of my family there British."
408.0,Provider,"So I totally get it, I totally get it."
16639.0,Patient,yeah that's cool yeah they met down and. my sister went down and business in the British Virgin Islands and tortola. that's where and fill up actually. I think he was born and raised on tortola but but he's very British his mother was from from Hampstead so yeah.
408.0,Provider,"lovely okay so here's our here's our next part of our therapy protocol, Mr hammond okay. Okay, so you're going to continue to work on your voice recognition learning the commands for your voice recognition application. And now you're going to practice applying that not only to emails but also to the documents, no legal documents. And you're going to do that now, with a timeframe goal in mind, which makes this much more measurable, which is between now and the 27th. you're going to do it, you do some editing of those documents using this new application so that maybe you have even advanced the project, a little bit by the time your daughter gets there okay and you're also going to reach out to your daughter. and asked her to set aside some time while she's there with you to work on merging the documents. Okay, that sounds like a worthwhile."
16639.0,Patient,I think it's.
408.0,Provider,Because.
16639.0,Patient,"yeah I need to use her calming and I hope to I hope I hope she does calm, but yeah I need to do that and and I need to get the I need to start cutting it down to size, a little bit before she gets here, so I don't overwhelm her I wanna I want to."
408.0,Provider,"Yes, so just just use the the voice recognition application to do that specific thing and don't try to do anything more. Just to cut back a little bit on the verbiage, you have to leave these goals very feasible. very concrete. very limited right otherwise your procrastination kicks them."
16639.0,Patient,yeah yeah of course yeah.
408.0,Provider,"And, not to mention the very real fatigue."
16639.0,Patient,yeah.
408.0,Provider,"Right okay yeah so that's your goal, between now and the 27th and you're going to have to specifically email your daughter using your voice recognition APP. To tell her that this is what you are asked her for for Christmas is two hours of her time when she gets there the 27th to work with you on this project. yo yo who hours."
16639.0,Patient,Right. Now that.
408.0,Provider,"That means you got to stop after two hours if she's there if she does come and if she does do it, you have to stop, and not just keep going and going and going."
16639.0,Patient,"Right right. Okay okay well that that's I think those are good good thoughts and. And i'm yeah i'm still getting getting used to the idea that she's gonna be here, most likely and i'm getting very, very excited about it and yeah if I could for the for the new year or get this thing off, you know. off my hands a little bit and onto the Court. i'll be a much happier man here so yeah. That sounds great doctor I appreciate it."
408.0,Provider,All so let's take our next appointment or next therapy appointment. yeah all right let's make that for. The 28. Thursday
16639.0,Patient,"The 28th of. December, the eighth."
408.0,Provider,i'm going to hold you accountable to do something between now and the 27th whether she comes or not okay.
16639.0,Patient,yeah.
408.0,Provider,"So one way of holding yourself accountable is to be in therapy and to have a therapy appointment, that you have to report. that's part of the problem solving protocol that. All right."
16639.0,Patient,yeah yeah yeah yeah did you say.
408.0,Provider,"not yet so I was gonna ask you on that day, are you available at."
16639.0,Patient,o'clock on Tuesday yeah sure sure.
408.0,Provider,All right.
16639.0,Patient,"I just want to say brief. Briefly, I want to say that um you know I I I commented on the mindfulness exercise on Wednesday and. yeah I said something i'm more activity more interested in, I think, as I mentioned something that sort of frustrated me and easily discouraged, maybe as a younger man, but i'm starting to wonder if Maybe my my head may have softened up enough to. To be able to follow through and and learn how to do it it's always been an interest of mine."
408.0,Provider,Excellent cool I hope you will have a chance to practice some of that also during the holiday.
16639.0,Patient,yeah I like to try to schedule that in it definitely.
408.0,Provider,"Good all right. All right, I will talk to you later."
16639.0,Patient,"bye bye Okay, thank you very much, have a good week."
