10961.0,Patient,hey manny.
214.0,Provider,hey how are you.
10961.0,Patient,i'm doing good. How about you.
214.0,Provider,"i'm good, thank you for asking i'm doing very well sorts know."
10961.0,Patient,"That that medication that shauntel put me on. It just got up to 300 milligram last week, and I mean i'm i'm noticing some changes, mostly in my life, while i'm at work, it seems. Like my mind isn't quite as drifting to what's going to happen afterwards, you know staying on schedule and I think Initially it was. To help me focus a little bit more to keep me from worrying about. Getting everything done that day, and you know it's one thing that i've. talked to my family about and is just that. I started helping out at the horses with at the ranch as a voluntary thing it was helping, but one thing that is um I have a lot of trouble with is like pleasing people you know it started out as voluntary, and you know I really enjoy it but it's becoming that. That drive that you know I started out as something that. Was. You know kind of relax and I was enjoying it, but as the time has gone on i've taken it more upon myself. To make it a priority, you know and a lot of times it's I know I don't have to be up there, but I i've made it so important to myself, you know that it's like a. gotta get up gotta do that and and it's not just with that it's it's just that a lot of times I feel i'm doing things because of others expectations in a way, you know and but it's hard for me to set my own. level of what am I trying to accomplish you know I kind of put that on the back burner and i'm seems like a lot of times i'm doing what's normal or what's expected or you know the what i've kind of taken upon myself and. I mean it's it's not horrible but sometimes. You know I got a little bit sick last week and I think it's just I run myself into the ground, and you know that's the whole idea of trying to slow it down was one of the goals that we talked about yesterday in group was to really try to live more in the moment, instead of just. You know it's good to set goals for the next day, but you know you can't put so much on your plate that you're not going to get it done and then you're going to get frustrated because you didn't get it done and then you know that whole cycle of. Of. trying to get too much accomplished and then. And then being frustrated when I can't get it all done and it's kind of the same thing that i've been going through the that medicine has helped me focus more on the task at hand, but it, it still seems like i'm. Not that there's enough medication that's going to be magic about this, but it's one thing that I still am having problems with is. That pleasing other people as well it's pleasing me and. I still haven't I don't feel like i've quite gained a leverage on. On feeling more like i'm putting myself first you know and and Besides that, I mean everything has been pretty good I just find myself struggling with the. You know what makes me happy, in a sense, because I seem to feel more accomplished when I am helping other people in a sense, or you know I don't it's it's kind of like that. cycle of. Almost I don't know what I want, so I I kind of go with with somebody else expects to me, and then I try to go for that and and then that it's like i'm running away from. What I would like to do is by finding somebody else that would like me to do something and. yeah it's so exhausting at times but um. You know that's the I think what really was driving me before to. To go drink or to do you know to smoke. Was that. It was like at the end of the day, or Minnesota in the day, but it's just that all right, you know kind of. push out what almost like a numbing feeling in a sense, you know, like I don't wanna I don't want to have to worry about pleasing someone or I don't want to have to you know do that, but then it really got to that negative point where it was like. All day you know and luckily months ago, and my actually first started this. I had had a pretty bad. relapse because in the beginning of the year I was doing really well and then it all just kind of a mounted and I just crumbled and then since then i've been very good about it is just that. it's like i'm still trying to find that numbing like put it all out in my mind relax and then that's why I stay busy all day you know, by trying to find stuff and ignoring the. Doing More of the. What we talked about, and I still have trouble with is the distraction, you know and that's really my biggest thing right now is that i'm still trying to distract myself from. A lot of things by engaging in a lot of activities and then you know in like today, I work from seven till four and then I went up to the stables from four to. 630 and then I showered and came here and then after this you know finally i'll be able to go home and and kind of just relax but. I like push myself to. To make a schedule that it's going to not allow me to have pretty much any free time you know, and then I find myself kind of running around in circles and. The weekends are sometimes the hardest, because I have no work so, then you know, and I know that that's the time I should be taking for myself, but. You know somebody usually i've been not always volunteering, but you know somebody asks hey you know, can you help me, will you do this on this day or this day and. I would say yes, and I take that on mostly because I want to have some sort of structure on the weekend days, but then you know come Monday it's like. You just went to all week never really got any real rest and now you're back at work and now. So it's like. Internal internally I it's like that's what i'm doing to myself, but then I also know that I need time. to rest and and it's. it's it's a little difficult, you know because i'm having just that. I don't know I don't really want to take time for myself, I just. Usually feel like you know her urban used to that being a negative thing you know it's like you need to be staying busy or productive and. Now it's like a. You know it's just really hard sometimes to take a chill pill, and you know watch a movie it's been a long time since I really did that you know and and. It most of the time it's because I don't make the time, but then, a lot of times it's that when I kind of do that I. it's only momentarily until I start like losing that focus of relaxing and then i'm like I should be doing something you know and then start cleaning or you know do this or do that and. and yeah it's a little exhausting sometimes so. And I think most of it is. That I don't have maybe like legitimate expectations of myself and I kind of set that standard up there and it's unattainable, and I just. I don't know I just feel like. By not help by not like doing something for someone else in a sense. I don't gain that pleasure, or that that satisfaction, you know and and it's. kind of like no take this time to be happy, so it does get pretty tiring and. You know."
214.0,Provider,"What you need to understand is you have an expectation of something you know nothing about. Just think about a minute I am keeping so busy in hopes that keeping busy as distraction, or which I don't go back and think. But i'm so busy being busy that i'm tired of being busy, but if I get tired that makes me feel bad as if I need to do some just think about the circle I just projected to right. Now I think what we started to work at the beginning was We thought that you know the the horse and the thing was a good way to. Get grounded, but what happens is everything you take out to do something you do it to do it, you don't do it with like they do today that's fine I don't mind if I don't do it mindless you say if I do a one sided adore forever well, if you take on. Something that should be of peace and resolve you take on as a job."
10961.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,"And what happens is youth condition your body to be full throttle so when Saturday comes and your children for two minutes your body's like you're lazy very you need to do something. You feel guilty and you jump in and start running and what you need to think about is say okay so i'm feeling guilty. But i'm not going to feel any better at the end of the day, by doing things to keep me busy that I don't really want to do. An over extending myself and then comes Monday and back to work and i'm going to say hi me you didn't even take a breath so need to think about this expectation that on setting. Why am I setting the expectation, to be busy and distract shouldn't I be on the expectation of So how do I get better how do I figure out really what's going on, I don't figure out what my passion is in my career's like I think. I think is a part of you that's fearful as if you'll come up with no answer as if that's. When the reality is it's not a bad thing to not know what you want to do that's a good thing, because now from there, you can figure something out keep. Being distracted so you don't have to admit you don't know what you want to be that's what you're having difficulty with your thinking i'm going to put all these things i'm going to be in every pocket in hopes that something cultivates it hasn't King true yet. So think the business is it's a distraction from the alcohol for sure, but the problem is the apple was always going to be this he always going to be distracted so we saying it I did you tie just from running running and running. And where is the enjoyment, where is the love love is the self like worth like what did I really accomplished, other than. I can't deal with my head I can't deal with my feelings or I am fearful I drink again on fearful of resolve to I don't know what the F i'm supposed to be doing, I see that as a positive but I don't see those and. So that's why i'm not a fan of distraction i'm a fan of self regulation i'm a fan of someone sitting in a chair for an hour two hours and being very uncomfortable but then figuring out, you know more comfortable but i'm scared. i'm scared i'm this age i'm scared I don't I didn't I didn't put enough money in the bank i'm scared and i'm thinking about what my career is going to be that's what's really bothering me. me being distracted because i'm running from this, but the reality is you don't need to run for it, if you have all this energy, you can place all this energy and for you, because you're not doing the energy for you, it winds up being fathers. If you need to channel that somehow back, I would say when it comes to the stables, I know this is going to be hired I will do it twice a day to those those those two days on. force yourself, not to go there, once they push yourself, not to go there Friday I should set up to do the two days, because that is. You want to give service, the service, you can get service every day because it's more of a distraction it's not about service some. i'm saying you need to pull back a little bit, but then, what are you going to do one day Wednesday Friday Saturday and Sunday, but you haven't figured out what you want to do. Like you went to the baseball game that one time we haven't talked in a while back, I think you said it was Okay, they would drink them using and. I don't."
10961.0,Patient,"know it was just that that's when it was like halfway through the game I started thinking like man i'm going to get home at this time and. Why did I even come to the game, when I knew I had to get up early or not necessarily early but it's like I I lost that this is my happy time you know, instead of."
214.0,Provider,"us. So you lose three hours of sleep, because with adults still they sacrifice one thing to gain one thing. yeah and we're all entrepreneurs says, I think you need to really look and see you know when it's all being that to know my passion is it's okay to not know all my career is. And now that i'm admitting that all know what are the actions i'm going to do to figure that out versus running around running around run around and some being at the same place you started off with. You need to say another take all this energy and put it back into me what what's my investment. I think you would be more suited to do that, and you should spend some time being uncomfortable you should. Because I think what you're doing most likely is running from whatever has been bothering you or. Things that you haven't discussed the bar and you need to sit in them, and now you're not gonna die and you're gonna be okay, maybe you will feel the need to distract them to you know what it's like to be uncomfortable you've got to want to distract because no one wants to be uncomfortable."
10961.0,Patient,"yeah and that's just. I mean I, I know that that's kind of what I need are, that is what I needed to do, but then it's. Like oh my excuses I don't have time for that you know because i'm already busy doing this."
214.0,Provider,"So I gotcha. And i'll be like. least try one day a week, maybe some dancing or flowers just consume my stuff i'm not wasted if you're not the bone my phone. just going to store it, let me see if I can find something when when i'm sitting in whatever is treasury or misery of fearful over one. Maybe I can find something in just sitting down and figuring out instead of me thinking something's going to come of me being over active and doing more like it hasn't gotten you anything, though man, maybe just. Running and feeling the emotion get to somewhere it's the other way it's not."
10961.0,Patient,yeah that's a good idea. yeah i'll try that at least. On a weekend day and see kind of what. What have what comes out of.
214.0,Provider,"There, maybe, maybe you're scared you're scared maybe you said some cereal listen, none of us want to have to admit, certain things but. Think about the the Aha moment and saying so i'm just freaking scared i'm. scared i'm just scared about being on one when you think about it it's not like it's the boogie man it's not like you know it's ptsd from. from being robbed or held hostage of being in Afghanistan it's like. You don't know actually what you're fearful of you don't know what you're overwhelmed this, but this thing is big, but you can identify, you can sketch it. You can't describe it that's very uncomfortable because we want to know things as people, what is it, but maybe, what is it isn't the answer, maybe it's just saying. You know what this is really me about this is the emotion I don't like I don't like holding this one thing. It makes me feel less than it makes me feel not like a man, it makes me feel inadequate. They enter fire because identifying needs Well, now we can work with this thing and we can figure out how to get through it, but we don't know what we're dealing with like we're fighting in the dark that's a tough battle."
10961.0,Patient,"mm hmm. yeah. It is it's like. i'd like to be a little bit more successful, but then. There are times I feel like oh i'm not good enough, you know or. You know I can't or and then I do get that confidence, but then it just there's something that's keeping me from applying myself a little bit more and. Then just kind of retreating to will I can do this, you know but. yeah I definitely need to kind of spend some time and just. Just do that but it's. yeah I guess that's what I don't want to do is have that time to wear. My I mean the reality kind of sets in so."
214.0,Provider,"it's tough but listen to me success and, and this is what we all must we all want to be successful, but we realized being successful is dangerous it's scary and there's a potential of it not happening. that's exactly what successes and pears, many of us. who'd rather sit in the background, so you know what. I don't like not being successful. I don't like having to figure out I can do something. So i'll stay over here where it's comfortable but meanwhile we're sitting in the back all we're doing is resenting the fact that we're not moving forward so you're not going to win. Unless you understand it's really okay to make a mistake and not be successful, maybe in your success, you need to find something else you can be successful at. That that's when people do a successful it be chomping at the bit to they figure out what they're going to accelerate and then they they go for it. It may have had 100 trials, they may have had 10 times but they're going to find them, but some of us that fear keeps us all away in the dugout it's like I don't want to want the back. I want to hit home on but then, if I figured out so they're gonna feel worse so i'll be over here in the world, via will like. will be an over here is no better it's almost as a non combatant strengthen our muscle strike out and figure out, what do you striking out to maybe your thought of what you should do isn't an nba juice somewhere else. that people have Aha moments, but making the mistakes and realizing Oh, and I thought i'd be good at this i'm not going to go back over here I deal with career changes all the time and it's difficult for people. yeah people are well established and they've lost their mojo and they have to figure out a palace, some people have any found them mojo. And they're like I don't think I can do anything unless they take it easy that's being catastrophic you don't know what you want to do it's almost like when you're a kid vicki we want to be everything and then there's a point where we're not being anything we talked we want to be. it's not a bad place, but we have to start with the way it feels and how it's uncomfortable and then say you know what I want this to go away me to go away, is to address them identify and then move from there."
10961.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
214.0,Provider,"Even if it's for an hour or or see many on what the masekela was for 15 minutes let's process with those 15 minutes or like because Maybe you can say to yourself, you know it's only 15 minutes suck but. It did it maybe next week you do 25 minutes but we're not going to come up with key. You know. yeah I did apply what we're going to come up gate is knowing when our baseline is. It you know you're not going to die like eat these things aren't going to kill you or hurt you it's just not going to feel but that's, the only thing you have to worry about. Maybe getting through those feelings will get you to launch what you want to do."
10961.0,Patient,Okay.
214.0,Provider,"I would suggest you try and for a minimum, as we can let's not put a time on."
10961.0,Patient,yeah now.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, fine. So what do you, what do you want to continue now when you think you want to do."
10961.0,Patient,As far as like.
214.0,Provider,"see me. Do you do one do it every week, do you want to do it every two weeks, how do you want, what do you think will be beneficial for you."
10961.0,Patient,"I mean once a week would be nice but I don't know if that's. I mean, I would like to talk to you once a week but."
214.0,Provider,"So I just want to be reflected as something to don't take this the wrong way take it as a positive one, I seeing you there was a point where we were seeing each other, although the movements are incremental they were moving by hairs you were moving. You were starting to figure out things."
10961.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,"It was starting time you were. yeah now it doesn't mean, but you were you were at least addressing feelings. You know what is going on right, and then we lost that we've lost that more joyful minute not blaming anybody not seeing anything, or when you were engaged, you were moving forward. Maybe you thought it was a fast enough maybe you thought you weren't moving forward, you will making progress, I would suggest you know you think that over and say you know what there was a benefit to doing this every week. i'll put an expectation on it to see the benefit to it. yeah and I think I think you know evolve better for you, I just do. so long to see what I got next week we'll probably have to be at the same time."
10961.0,Patient,that's fine.
214.0,Provider,So. You have a group on Monday right. So we actually can do Thursday the 21st. And we can do it at 730.
10961.0,Patient,Okay.
214.0,Provider,"I think the idea here is to. let's work on. Being uncomfortable but let's not focus on career change i'm have the capabilities to do this let's not work on distraction let's work on what is uncomfortable ways uncomfortable. Something i'm not willing to do what is it a bond, because I think this is the one week, we have to figure out how to light. So ISO 27. The sum of what i'm suggesting shit we're talking about a situation you're in."
10961.0,Patient,"yeah I mean there's this job that i've that I have right now it's. it's you know. I enjoy I I guess I I like being there but it's because i'm so comfortable in a sense, and. i'm trying to move forward, you know, I was trying to. apply to. An apprenticeship and and and you know that it went well they're just they'll call me when they need me kind of thing and so now i'm kind of feel like i'm. In this waiting room and then my my roommate he's works in sales and you know he's are used to work in sales as well and he's pretty high up and management and they need a guy so he asked me if I wanted to but it's like. My whole thing is. You know that whole I don't think i'll be good at it and i'm not good at it, then what am I gonna how am I going to go try to get my my job that I have right now back even though it's not the greatest, but it is providing an income, and you know i've, so I am. kind of afraid to take that step and it's kind of been bugging me because it's. I just feel like i'm really going through the motions at the job I have right now and it's kind of like. You know how long is this going to last. You know how can I do this forever kind of thing and so part of it is that I would really like to hear back from the pipe fitters Union but it's it's like um. And then i'm thinking you know when Oh, if I get into that then everything will be better or you know, then i'll be able to move forward and. I just feel like i'm in this weird waiting spot where it's. i'm waiting for something better, you know the possibility is there and then. I mean the company i'm working for right now, they would like me to commit more so, but they under you know they know i'm trying to get this other job so he's like I don't. want to bring you on full time on payroll because I, you know, unless unless you're going to commit to this company, so now i'm like. Do I commit to this company do I wait to hear from that company or you know, do I try to take this sales job and it's. kind of like. If I could just know for certain that you know I will I got into the apprenticeship or I did you know I feel like that would really help me out to try to make a decision on the next step or. You know, should I just count that as a last even though there's a year grace period pretty much that. They could call me at any time, which it is a Union job so it's kind of like they bring you on as they need you, and they are I got an email from them saying. I did really well and scored in the top third, and they will I might not get called the first time that they will call me eventually so it's like do I just wait for this year and keep this little job or am I. You know, should I. that's the whole do I commit to the job I have right now and move forward, and you know, probably make a little bit more, but. It won't have that. That. Like the certainty of you know, the apprenticeship is five years and then you graduate and usually get into a Union position so that sets me up a little bit more for."
214.0,Provider,"My future but just remember what you're doing just think about it for a minute, and I mean to cut you off sure, creating enzyme."
10961.0,Patient,"Yes, well."
214.0,Provider,let's let's think about something everything you're thinking about makes sense if here it is you have everything and nothing at the same time.
10961.0,Patient,Almost yeah.
214.0,Provider,"I would say to you go back to this one in the hand tool in the bush if the apprentices job calm, so that that opportunity comes it comes comes today it comes in five years from now. You need to pull people's today, so what is the one thing that provides a salary to pay bills that's one in the hand. sounds job will provide a salary, will you even like it will it work out that's a lot of water, so we need to think about. Okay, if you bring this job, and it provides me stability, I think what i'm going to just hang on to stability and we for the unicorn me. This way, whenever they call me that's what i'll make the leap, but the thing you're going to go from this company to the sales hopping Union calms me or false thrill you've got nothing to land back on."
10961.0,Patient,Right.
214.0,Provider,"So you either stay with this job and see you know what i'm going to hang out, you know i've been walking admitted, whatever the money, maybe, or whatever. And don't tell him anymore, and just say my dream is to get called for the leave tomorrow and make sure if i'd be there's things going to call you when you least expect it to be. Months that could be yours, but in the interim you're paying your bills and you're doing a job and your hope is when you leave you're gonna leap into something much better this wall leaves. it's just too risky, so I would go one hand, let the Bush to Bush go."
10961.0,Patient,"yeah and that's what you know i've. talked to you know my family about it and that's you know that that's definitely the best choice it's just that I got like. The company I work, for you know I make between two and three grand a month, which isn't the greatest but it's not by no means bad you know it's paying my bills, but then it's the it's not it's mostly under the table, you know so then you're. Like I really have nothing to show for and but it's like. It is. it's good and bad at the same time, so that's where i'm like I get that how long can I ride this out for or you know, do I not worry about that, until the time comes, because."
214.0,Provider,"that's what I would do. Because listen, I mean, could I be giving you bad advice absolutely I know that you've been doing this job for a minute so maybe maybe the idea is to go on the books are going on the box may be may mean to cut in pay. and communication barriers and I get the taxes yeah the father, says the other one is your ultimate goal really is to go to the Union job anyway so just hear me out on that. This isn't the greatest opportunity, but you already know what you're already dealt with these people you kind of see those pay the bills, so it does fulfill some of the check boxes which are ultimate goal is bigger than this company anyway, but this company some provide some stability. stability. And then, when that call comes you do it don't even hesitate, of going into another industry it's not about whether or not you're competent not. You gotta hope this shit works out so you get a paycheck right now you're getting a paycheck so you can go from I hope to holy crap and then think you may go back you may not go back to. Right it's just too risky it's too risky it doesn't it doesn't when I process it doesn't tell me that's a good move."
10961.0,Patient,"Okay yeah that's good advice, thank you."
214.0,Provider,"you're welcome to like pick a moment to yourself let's see what uncomfortable is let's keep working with each other, I think you're going to do great. But again don't push yourself and don't ask yourself to do more than you can do it's going to take as long as it's going to take you can't make it go any faster."
10961.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,"yeah it's tough to swallow, because the truth."
10961.0,Patient,"yeah that is. Just kind of I mean I know i'm in that limbo state but it's learning that you know you can't I can't hurry it any faster, you know, one day, at a time, and I think that."
214.0,Provider,"Is it's all of this. Okay, so then i'll See you in group and then i'll see you next Thursday."
10961.0,Patient,Alright sounds good.
214.0,Provider,And we take a you have a good night.
10961.0,Patient,Thanks manny.
214.0,Provider,you're welcome bye bye.
