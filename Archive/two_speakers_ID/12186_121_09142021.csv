ID,Role,Message
121.0,Provider,This is gonna be individual therapy for Sarah burstein. Good morning.
12186.0,Patient,"hi sorry. took me a minute I I make it so that i'm muted automatically when I joined that's something I had from school. Just because I didn't want to like accidentally join a meeting and then have stuff in the background, anyway, I should take that setting off because it's a little annoying for therapy."
121.0,Provider,it's fine.
12186.0,Patient,"i'm doing really well it's been a good week, I was productive this week and my mom and I got along great so. Good maybe. I told my mom before this is like mom I have nothing to talk about it, like nothing bad to talk about it therapy and she was like don't say that every time you say that we end up like fighting beforehand. it's fine we were we're good. Good best friends forever, I mean, obviously we had like little."
121.0,Provider,yeah.
12186.0,Patient,You got i'm with her 24 seven pretty much because we live together now so.
121.0,Provider,yeah. So what have you been up to this week.
12186.0,Patient,um I got a lot of my secondary stuff done. What.
121.0,Provider,Did you eat your laptop back.
12186.0,Patient,"Yes, they it was so quick I got it back really like on Friday. So it was like three days. It wasn't bad and also apple's os and I was able to actually set everything up on my mom's computer through the cloud so it's basically like I had all almost all my stuff that I save to the cloud on her computer. So I was able to work on it, then as well, but yeah i'm really excited about that and. here's one thing I came to the realization every single school has a section that says we understand that it was really hard with coven to get clinical experience. You know, do research do the things you needed to do we understand that so don't stress and they give you like an essay space to explain what you went through during coven and what you learned. And like creative ways that you overcame it and it made me realize wait everything that I thought would prevent me from getting into Medical School. They recognize. And they're giving you explain and i'm like and my stats are well, like every other Stat that I have like my GPA my research like I have over 1000 hours of research work. So, like there are multiple ways to go about it, and I was realizing i'm like I very well could get into Medical School is time time around like I kind of wrote myself off and then I was like, why are you writing yourself off. So, and I also kind of like I always said, like there's no way i'm going to get into unc exit is hard to get into unc but the more I think about it, the more i'm like I could. there's a very good chance that I could get into unc. And I would love that. that's exciting. What."
121.0,Provider,I said that's exciting.
12186.0,Patient,"yeah it is, and then I also like came to the realization that. Because I was always like Oh, am I going to like not be able to do Medical School is it going to be so hard blah blah blah, and I was like look at all I accomplished. While I wasn't eating like I tried to tell myself i'm oh my gosh like. You maintained a high G pay you had a part time job and You ran that you trained like another level runner all well, you are undernourished like imagine what you can do. When you're actually eating and i'm going to use that in my interview what's going to come up and say like. How, how are you going to prevent the stress of Medical School from you know sending you back and setting you back on a road that you were on before. But i'm prepared in that I can say well that's why I spent my entire summer developing coping strategies being honest with people developing a support system, such that, I mean i'm going to literally say to the people interviewing me. I think i'm the best possible person, you could enroll or accept with regards to stress management, because that's really all I did over the summer was learn the coping strategies and the skills to no longer. I guess use those behaviors. I feel prepare."
121.0,Provider,awesome and.
12186.0,Patient,"positive about it. So exciting that happened and also like writing these essays. I don't know it's just making me really introspective too, because it starts to like you start to reflect on things and see how you would act in certain situations and whatnot so. yeah I just hope to hear back about interview soon so."
121.0,Provider,Do you have any idea when you'll hear about.
12186.0,Patient,"Now, probably like within a few weeks or so, they have to review my applications first so. yeah and then i'm excited because i'm going to the allergy doctor on Thursday. Good i'm just really excited to know like. What am I allergic to not just because I have that allergic reaction, but also i'm just interested. I always wanted to get allergy testing done."
121.0,Provider,Now you can't.
12186.0,Patient,"yeah, I guess, I have a reason now. yeah."
121.0,Provider,What else been going on.
12186.0,Patient,"um besides that not a lot i've been doing a lot of work, you know, working on the secondaries and whatnot um. What else is going on, oh the car situation that's pretty much sold we sold my car. Not for my brothers purposes, but just because nobody really felt safe in my car because it's so low to the ground can really see out of it. And we just realized like Okay, we could keep it and the money could depreciate or we could get like you know $4,000 for it now. So we sold it and for all, intensive is my dad's which is like a 2015 jeep cherokee so it's a nice car, you know that's my car now pretty much he doesn't really like it's his car but i'm the only one that really uses it because he works from home. We don't really drive it we just like use my mom's car we go out on the weekends, or something like that, and he said that that's going to be like he's waiting for for him to come out with a new car, that is to get. And they will officially be my car, but I am so thankful, because that car has 100,000 miles on it, it will get me through Medical School. yeah Medical School is expensive and not having a card payment. will be amazing. yeah truly. yeah. So. That whole situation is fine, my brother bought a car, his first big purchase."
121.0,Provider,See excited.
12186.0,Patient,"yeah he is because it's like it's his you know he got a really good interest rate was like 1.67 or. Something like that, and they were like oh my gosh that doesn't happen for people. Who, you know just started a job just graduated barely have I mean he has really good credit which is surprising because he's only been using credit card for like I don't even know not a long time. yeah so I was happy for him."
121.0,Provider,yeah that's exciting.
12186.0,Patient,yeah.
121.0,Provider,How are you doing with food and eating and all that stuff.
12186.0,Patient,"really good. everything's like a lot easier now just like picking meals and. I have cravings I have hunger, I don't blow it anymore, which is awesome i'm past that which is. makes everything easier. I went to trader joe's for my big all. grocery trip, I guess, and it was so much fun. rhonda and I were talking about the dark chocolate covered pumpkin spice granola bark oh good it's so good. We went through two bags and like three days i'm not kidding it's awesome and then they have like pumpkin spice hummus it's literally just pumpkin pie filling it's so good. yeah."
121.0,Provider,You did on.
12186.0,Patient,"pretzels apple I want to buy pie crust and just make the pie. And then, like chop it up a bit, and I think that'd be good yeah. So overall. Food has been good. And you've been there last night, my mom made marinated what are you."
121.0,Provider,Balancing that with like school like school work. Type sites so yeah.
12186.0,Patient,"yeah um and last night, like my mom made we grilled cod, but she marinated it and, like fresh herbs from the garden, and like oil and salt and stuff. And like I was eating and i'm like this is incredible and I would have been freaking out about this dish. Like three months ago and i'm like oh my gosh there's so much oil, I can taste the oil and she even put too much salt on it, which it still tastes again because, like salt is good. But she was like Oh, this is a little too salty and I would have freaked out about that too i've been like oh my gosh so much sodium and I was like I think it's pretty freakin good so. He was like great."
121.0,Provider,Good good.
12186.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah crazy to reflect on how far i've come. Also, I got weighed on Friday, and I see my way I it doesn't really bother me but i'm almost 30 pounds my lowest point nearly. And I like wrote this in my journal or something i'm like it's so funny because I was so afraid of change and the prospect of like being different and like what I would look like what I would be like you know how I feel. And what I was so afraid of is literally, the best thing that happened to me. Like now i'm confident, I was telling him i'm like I was just sitting in the shower like looking down at my body like. Oh, my gosh I love my body like I truly love it wasn't just me saying that to like make myself believe it I looked down, and I was like I love my body like i'm so happy, where I am. Good and I haven't got my period, yet, but I keep on cramping like where my uteruses."
121.0,Provider,it'll come.
12186.0,Patient,"it'll come up. Every morning my mom and I wake up my moms like Sarah maybe today's a day. she's like today's gonna be such a good day you're going to hear back from the jobs, you applied for and you're going to hear back from medical schools, inviting you for an. interview and you're going to get your period and it's going to be amazing and i'm like I like the positivity like you have even gone to therapy, you know the power of manifestation and like positive affirmations."
121.0,Provider,that's awesome.
12186.0,Patient,"Oh, this is random I went to trader joe's and I got this fall addition kombucha. I don't love it, but it was like it was. $3 or $4. And during yet, but. it's interesting."
121.0,Provider,What what flavor like what's the flavoring in.
12186.0,Patient,"apple turmeric carrot and spices. hmm I thought it would be like apple cider but I, like the pink lady apple one better. I mean it's fine The more I drink it, the more it's growing. Every step, I take i'm like I do kind of like."
121.0,Provider,"Well, there you go."
12186.0,Patient,Interesting that's Another thing I don't love it but i'm still drinking it. it's not a waste.

12186.0,Patient,"i'm proud of myself, too, am I allowed to say."
121.0,Provider,"Yes, please say that I like really proud of myself."
12186.0,Patient,"Oh, I didn't tell you this, but when I graduated from I op my mom got me this old bracelet. And it has to charms on it one of them's a Lotus flower, and one of them's just in my initial but that she like printed out this whole like the meaning behind the Lotus flower I don't have it with me, but it was this whole like long. Paper about how like Lotus flowers are like firm and I don't remember what it was, but it was basically like it means something about like perseverance and like. Even in struggles and. stuff like that it was just really meaningful and that was so sweet."
121.0,Provider,that's really sweet.
12186.0,Patient,I know I was like I love the meaning behind it to you know. So I never told you about that I forgot about that. But i've been wearing it ever since.
121.0,Provider,"that's really sweet. My parents gave me a bracelet when I went to try out the first time. And it's got its got a charm on it and it's got my initials on one side and on the other side says believe, and I still wear."
12186.0,Patient,I love that that's so cute. yeah. Just like every time you look down on it. Remember that's kind of why I wanted to get a tattoo but i'm indecisive.
121.0,Provider,me too that's why the bracelet was really.
12186.0,Patient,"I forgot a tattoo of the smallest thing ever that probably only I could really see or know about, because, like I said i'm a nice and and also. it's safer that way."
121.0,Provider,yep.
12186.0,Patient,So. funny stuff.
121.0,Provider,yeah so have you heard back from any of the job shop.
12186.0,Patient,"um no. i'm gonna follow up oh that one yeah they fill the position. They didn't tell me about it, though, like I reached out to them and i'm like oh so I just want to know, like. what's a city like I basically just sent a night I don't remember exactly what I said basically said I really like I really enjoyed speaking with you and i'm excited at the opportunity like. Have you made any decision yet and we're like sorry we feel the position I was like oh cool thanks for time."
121.0,Provider,yeah thanks for letting me know that.
12186.0,Patient,"Are it's hard because. I can only commit to a few months, right now, based off the fact that I could be going to Medical School."
121.0,Provider,"Well, when, would you go to Medical School when would that start."
12186.0,Patient,"Like I would probably have to end my job places like Oh, can you committed he he."
121.0,Provider,Wait sorry you froze for a second.
12186.0,Patient,"When would you so sorry I said, my Internet connection was unstable again I I need to get better wi fi but um they all ask, can you commit at least a year and i'm like well I might be going to Medical School. And there. Are in jobs where I would like, if I was applying to be like a barista like work at target, I would just lie, to be honest, a bit yeah. But. I don't feel comfortable in this shouldn't I don't I mean I never feel comfortable buying but can milk the truth, but actually what i'm looking into during. Our the end of the month do a nurse's aide certification course just to get some sort of like that'll help that'll give me clinical experience hours it'll be useful skills anyway and there's so many nurses at jobs out there, much more than medical striving. So. i'm thinking about signing up for one of those courses, I just have to call them today because. I want to ensure that they will have the course because there aren't that many people enrolled in it right now and I don't want them I don't want to be banking on that and then have them cancel it. inquire about what would happen in that scenario."
121.0,Provider,That makes sense.
12186.0,Patient,"It just stinks like I have a college degree, having so much difficulty finding a job. But it's not like I can go and get like. A real person job, do you know what i'm saying like I can't go and get a career so job. I would have to get something entry level which sucks because I have like I said a college degree. My mom told me she's like Sarah honestly, you should just job, a target they pay $15 an hour and at least we'll be making money than and putting that away and i'm kind of thinking about it."
121.0,Provider,What if he doesn't then volunteer like.
12186.0,Patient,"that's what that's what i'm thinking about now because it's like that's another option going down because, if I don't I applied for like three more jobs that I could get. um and i'm waiting to hear back from them and i'm going to follow up with them today, so I applied last week, so I think now is an appropriate time to me and say hey just wanted to follow up and see if you got my application blah blah blah. But after that I think i'm just going to volunteer and shadow. yeah and then. get a job because I want to make money."
121.0,Provider,I was because I mean that way you're still getting the experience of being in the medical field. And you're making money and.
12186.0,Patient,yeah.
121.0,Provider,And it makes total sense.
12186.0,Patient,"Okay game plan. I mean there's options just I hate I don't know. it's just annoying because I went to school for four years, and I can't find a job, and the only way I can get a job is if I go get certified for something and pay more money it's just stupid cuz it's like one year."
121.0,Provider,I was part of what makes it hard oh.
12186.0,Patient,yeah. So. Oh well. i'm trying at least I still i'm still doing that remote. Pharmaceutical development company jobs at least i'm making a lot of money. A lot but. At least it's something and i'm going to saving money to I don't really spend my money.
121.0,Provider,On that's also I mean another nice thing about being at home right now is this year builder.
12186.0,Patient,yeah yeah it's really nice. So silver lining in that.
121.0,Provider,Absolutely.
12186.0,Patient,"yeah but other than that, I mean like I said, not much going on i'm. Just patiently waiting for fall to get here. And weather has been nicer so it's hot again today, but."
121.0,Provider,i'm in North Carolina right now so i'm not. Really yeah.
12186.0,Patient,I thought your background is different.

121.0,Provider,"And it's like Thursday, Friday. yeah so. yeah. Anything else you want to talk about today."
12186.0,Patient,i'm boring. Good.
121.0,Provider,"boring is good, I am."
12186.0,Patient,Probably or least syncopation.
121.0,Provider,"I think it's great that you're doing well, I. Think totally fine with that."
12186.0,Patient,"I like doing well, I can make something up. My mom and I got into such a big argument. She disown me."
121.0,Provider,And that's why i'm still sitting in the same House.
12186.0,Patient,"I miss everyone in group, though."
121.0,Provider,yeah. You can do the Saturday support group.

I just feel like I have my shit together and. A good feeling."
121.0,Provider,Is a good feeling. My dog is walking around like swimming.
12186.0,Patient,"Oh, my dog does that anytime anyone eats he's like he just looks up at them and, like wines. i'm like shut up i'm trying to enjoy my food. he's."
121.0,Provider,"Oh, my God baby, so my sister's family has i've been going over to my sister's house. So my parents are. In Africa."
12186.0,Patient,Oh yeah you told me about that.

But his way of saying is like getting in her face and like like just constantly innovating like he can't come himself down. And so, find like during dinner like we have to separate them and so like he goes like behind the baby gate. And it is like the most not relaxing situation because, like she's on one side he's, on the other, he, like. wants to get through like at night we put him outside and he got up on like the ledge outside of the window, it was like staring."
12186.0,Patient,awful.
