7788.0,Patient,We got a 630 meeting this morning and cams on I like what you get like I. apologize.
416.0,Provider,I mean they're like you don't show up in your pajamas at that time.
7788.0,Patient,"yeah I was, I mean i'd be up here but it's just 630 is a lot for. I don't get them as much anymore, just because my boss has kind of put a stop to that because she's also west coast. Sometimes she'll get a 5am here and there, and she's like those are ridiculous."
416.0,Provider,yeah. I mean you can even think at that time. I don't know.
7788.0,Patient,"I have another success, I have an exam tomorrow so that one. um it's bi weekly so. I we've asked them to move it but they can't on their end so it's 3pm in Spain during that time you."
416.0,Provider,know my goodness yeah the times and stuff is so tricky.
7788.0,Patient,it's so hard. When I came off oh my God.
416.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh you seem like you're in pretty good spirits, though."
7788.0,Patient,"This week has been quiet, in a sense that there weren't any like burning fires and things to deal with, and then. um last Friday. There was a little bit of like tension with josh on. Like inviting or that whole planning thing with cleanse and during couples therapy and. It was a little bit of attention because he felt as if, like I didn't want to spend time for I didn't want him to spend time with his friends. And it was just trying to communicate to him, like no that's not the case, I. was trying to explain to him, like these are people you work with. And like. I just feel left out, but. You know, at the end of the day, if we separated you'd still be connected to these people and I probably wouldn't i'm. kind of do things together with them and not included, and after four or five different doing this to them, it just throws me a lot."
416.0,Provider,This has been a sticking point for you guys for a while.
7788.0,Patient,"and i've asked him and he doesn't get to the point of like I don't understand like I tried to include you but i'm like yeah but I mean on a level of like thank you, but then. On a different level it's my insecurity it's it's it's something I need to come come come to terms with for me where you know i'm used to not i'm used to moving a lot and not. building relationships and making her I don't get close to people because i'm going to move again or i'm going to leave so it's really weird for me to see my partner having these long connections and I feel like I don't know what to do with it. But I don't know what to do with. like this one friend of his and a little bit of it is jealousy because just. jealousy me like rational and just irrational Pelosi and anxiety my first thought. In her. place and so she will. find a car and. it's just that I tried to reach out to her about like spending time together because she just moved here from France with her child and then she kind of like brushed off. So I talked to my friend about it, and my friends like well she's close to josh okay like you know she. she's amicable with you, I mean she said well she's you know guys are building relationship, but she's not. you're not josh like she's known josh and we're teenagers, the family and so mean you're essentially the girl that. josh married and they're happy to welcome you, but so don't expect people to try and be close to you were just kind of like a rude awakening, but that is true, like i'm like chatroom doesn't mean like for josh is friends i'll be lifelong kindred spirits with them."
416.0,Provider,Right it'd be nice but it doesn't always work that way.
7788.0,Patient,"And then she asked me the question, do you want to hang out with her i'm like no and why are you even trying. I just feel like it's good to know you're seeing this is you're not pleasing yourself you're just pleasing the situation if you don't know where, hopefully, that is true, actually, so I kind of stopped with that um if we go."
416.0,Provider,It comes back to that issue of fear of abandonment really.
7788.0,Patient,Yes.
416.0,Provider,"Right that's sort of the underlying need here is this like reassurance that you need from him, the problem is that when you have the PD it's kind of constant reassurance right because your brain plays tricks on you."
7788.0,Patient,and
416.0,Provider,Then it becomes this thing that interferes so thinking about maybe how. How to kind of counteract that a little bit and be able to. I don't know just like think through it and it just in the sense that. Because it's not a logical fear it's something that dates back to your childhood right like it's very. it's very. I don't know why I can't. Say words today.
7788.0,Patient,But I understand where you're trying.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, thank you, I don't know what is wrong with me I ever like. I think i've been talking too much today i'm just out of words do we have like a daily word quota. Apparently, have reached mind."
7788.0,Patient,Sometimes I just hope people would.
416.0,Provider,"Point in growth. Over the. yeah so what I feel like today um. So yeah, but it does, I mean it it's such a fundamental issue with BT right it comes back to that fear of abandonment that like and that all or nothing thinking of like you're either with me all the time, or you don't love me."
7788.0,Patient,"And you're getting away. And that was where so on Friday. We that Friday night I hung out with my girls, so I had that. I know I absolutely love them and. On Saturday afternoon Saturday morning there was still residual feelings from Friday just because he was pretty much really holding it in like why. Why did I think like he's hanging out 200 Clarence are like replacing me for clients like it kind of hit a nerve for him and so on Saturday we talked and I was like I really want to talk about this and. After a while like it came down to cuz I told him, like the need for me when we spend time together with friends, is that quality time is out the window. Because like What do you mean I don't spend time with them like no you don't like honestly you don't and i've come to the realization that that's Okay, because your your attention is split to multiple people that are with us on the trip. And so I won't get quality time I think what triggered me stop holidays i'm usually you would family and this year it's even harder, because my mom I can't. i'm not gonna be with my mom not gonna be my sister and so you're the mean you are close to me and then here you're wanting to spend time when. Clarence, who is also your family but I don't feel like I kept trying to tell him like I don't feel that connection, that you do with them. And maybe in time I would I do care for them and he's like um, but it was just frustrating that that was your go to he's like I wasn't even the one that invited. You I wasn't even the one that initiated the conversation, it was Clarence it's like well I kept asking your Friday couples like what do you want to do and i'm like I don't know what I want to do, but I do know what I want and need us to spend time with you."
416.0,Provider,mm hmm.
7788.0,Patient,That is the primal root of everything.
416.0,Provider,This is the hot.
7788.0,Patient,And when we go with clearance what ends up happening is I get stressed out because you end up being babysitting him he gets drunk too drunk for his own good and you're the big brother. And then I get stressed out because I see his daughter seeing this situation and I can really like I love her why she just a different sense so. i'm and then it just rattles me and I don't enjoy the trip anymore. yep and so.
416.0,Provider,"All that adds a whole new layer to it, I didn't. know that was a part of this so."
7788.0,Patient,"it's been a while like so the trip to just have an intro occasion so trip i've had two trips and Clarence and his family are gonna first trip. He was so drunk he passed out in the room, thankfully, his nieces and nephew and sister were with us so they had a different room and his daughter was in the other room with her cousins so she didn't see but she's used to seeing her dad drunk. Okay that's like. Then next trip is her 13th birthday. And josh and I were already going through. We were going through that phase in June, where he was like I don't have feelings for you, and so I still went i'm just because. I just went because I do care for the girl, and this trip was playing, and I want to go beat there for 30 for. The night before we're going to come home he got Clarence got so drunk to where he blacked out and started. spewing words crying being belligerent like scared his daughter. The next day he couldn't remember anything josh had to kind of calm them down I grabbed his daughter, and her friend in our bedroom and then have the girls sleep there, so it was just like. I told you, I was like i'm traumatized by this like I don't he's a ticking time bomb I don't know what to expect from him. Okay, like the George was like well he's trying he's trying to like i'm tired of you like you see what what's going on it's like you will always be there for him. And you made that clear that's amazing that's an amazing trade for you, that is, you Okay, but I do not want to be subjected to that environment, so I get so stressed, because I care, a lot more, so I care a lot for parents, but I hate seeing his daughter go through that. um."
416.0,Provider,yeah that's. It okay yeah that's a whole different level that's.
7788.0,Patient,"A whole different level of I don't. I mean, I tried to disassociate from that so I don't get riled up and my emotion start crossing, but I do get stressed out i'm. Because I see treats and his daughter like i've been through so many counseling sessions i've been through so many types of therapy like. Like that's one thing I talked to this mom or your mom about it she's so quiet and she doesn't talk about her feelings. And i'm like that terrifies me. Okay, like from someone who's did that, for a while and then was, in her 20s like. I. And so I don't know it's just it frustrates me, so I guess there's some mixed mixed emotion frustration anger, the same time he's cutting into my time with my husband so it's like there's a lot of there's resentment building up for."
416.0,Provider,uh huh uh huh. Look legit yeah.
7788.0,Patient,"And he's a great guy um in terms of like he's there for wash and I, but I need him to frickin man up because he can't keep relying on my husband. till the end of time granted okay."
416.0,Provider,josh isn't isn't standing up to him around this right.
7788.0,Patient,"Oh, because it's like josh. He has a very good heart, he will always be there for the person he loves even though josh and I got separated, he will always be there for me, I know that 100% um, and that is what's frustrating with josh because. He doesn't know. Where the glare means. And so he's talked to him a couple times here and there, and. So my I told him okay Well, this is what's going to happen because he's like so you're not going to go on TRIPS me in the morning, like i'm going to read i'm going to us okay how I want to go about the situation does some straight up no. um however what's going to happen there is for my sanity i'm just not going to care. Because."
416.0,Provider,How are you going to do that.
7788.0,Patient,"And that's another thing it's like well. If I know for a fact, but clarins is going to get drunk in become ridiculous i'm just gonna not even deal with it i'm just gonna go with i'm not even gonna i'm not i'm just getting more of that and just go with the second direction or separate from. You."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so you're going to have an exit strategy before you go is kind of what i'm hearing. Okay. All right, and but and."
7788.0,Patient,or I will control the liquor in the trip. And josh was like fine I was like no hard alcohol beer phones.
416.0,Provider,"I don't understand why josh is I mean, I know that he's a very giving and loving person, but it sounds like he's afraid a little bit to kind of have a direct conversation with him about this."
7788.0,Patient,"He has hard one because of that blackout incident. and Clarence for a while, was like no hard liquor and then he saw on hard liquor but he hasn't had an incident like that, where he was too drunk to function. joshua's and see it and I, I honestly want to keep touching base on this therapy, but it's so tricky because josh gets offended. Where I feel like Clarence uses you as a failure and it's an excuse to let loose to the point that he knows you're always have your feel you always come back. Because. Only yeah the only times i've seen him really get stupidly enumerated is with josh are like other friends even one of our good friends was like he's done like I don't want him around us when he's stupidly drunk or he just keeps drinking when he's around us, so he cuts them off."
416.0,Provider,uh huh.
7788.0,Patient,"Okay, so our House, I don't allow hard liquor anymore, with him, he can stick to beer. daughters my rule, and so, if he's not around us like do what you can, but then with hippie if i'm with him and his daughter like I I make sure he's not on hard liquor."
416.0,Provider,Absolutely.
7788.0,Patient,"So it's. Like managing that and it's hard, because if it was just clients like I feel like josh we don't I don't know, maybe. Separate a little bit, but there's the factor of briana which is he controls, but. Really."
416.0,Provider,"that's a tricky position to put you in, and I see why it's causing. Tension for sure."
7788.0,Patient,"you've had my mom was just like getting ridiculous, I mean. My mom sees it to where he needs to respect that boundary like. husband and wife like he does he does, but it's just like. When we're in these trips where we're in this trips when I with other trips with his other friends, you have a party they drink, but then there's control there's still a sense of control the. guys are idiots. So act like children. But level of control, but then with him it's just like he doesn't care he will keep going and going and going, but then what's different is that your daughter is seeing do this."
416.0,Provider,And it's so out of control.
7788.0,Patient,"Yes, I mean. yeah but I i've scolded him at one point, like do not ask her daughter to grab your beer in my house."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
7788.0,Patient,"Go get your butt up and go to my forgive me fucking fridge and get your own beer, but your 13 year old daughter, and my uncle."
416.0,Provider,Now.
7788.0,Patient,"So we i've even had that I mean he that's maybe why like i'm not supposed to cleanse because I set these rules and he might not like him, I don't know I don't care, I honestly don't care if he doesn't like the rules and don't stay with me."
416.0,Provider,that's right.
7788.0,Patient,"It doesn't. You know, he and he doesn't stop in and that's I think my issue he doesn't step in, for fear that. clearings will be sensitive enough and cut ties and he can't talk to her IANA because it has happened before."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so josh feels like he's stuck in between a rock and a hard place here which he kind of is. Yes, because he's worried about losing ariana. yeah and you see this behavior that's pretty intolerable. Yes, which it really is yeah."
7788.0,Patient,"It really is, I mean it's not just me it's other people to enter for Colin."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
7788.0,Patient,"This is. A yeah today, we can only do so much, I am not appearing. On this on my daughter, but at least when she's with me when i'm around like. there's some level of security in that i'm mature she's not gonna be subjected to stuff like that traumatizing things like."
416.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah. So I don't know it's times like these that i'm like okay circle of control circle of influence you. know, can I guess."
7788.0,Patient,"that's where it's like Okay, what I can control them when I can control, I can control what type of environment i'll be in so. depends on the situation know if it's like the last time I went I went to Reno for new years and that I couldn't control apocryphal intake for him because of our. One where we were able to control. or Yannick can see or not she was able to go into the other hotel room and spend time with your cousins supposed to watching are done that be true in our actual room and sober up so she was away from that but it's like. I think what the disc what irritated me was that Oh, we went GA was like we do spend time like no we don't like we never do spend time together all the time because we're busy babysitting or interacting with other people. And then he's like well I see you interacting with other people yeah because you don't want me being an idiot in the corner quiet and I also don't want that for myself, so I push myself push past my social anxiety to actually interact with these people. i'm sorry I."
416.0,Provider,get it.
7788.0,Patient,"long discussion of the weekend, what and I told them like I don't want to talk about this anymore, I want to move on from this, so any trips coming up. i'm going to decide whether or not I want to go and we Bush and be okay with that um and no feelings regardless if it's if it's a holiday or some sentimental day. Because I know for fact if i'm in that trip with you a mega triggered we're gonna fight no one's gonna have fun so i'd rather do something where maybe refresh i'm gonna i'm fine and then we can come back together and share stories and still be in a. Love relationship, and so we decided that."
416.0,Provider,I think that's brilliant. that's brilliant because it's just.
7788.0,Patient,"I can, I have to also meet him halfway and this is what it can give me at the moment is he loves these people like found out that I may never understand the relationship, he has to understand that. and come to it on his own terms, but what I can control control, I can control, whether i'm in that situation or not, and I can influence how do with each other in terms of those days so."
416.0,Provider,Rarely it. That is true.
7788.0,Patient,"So that was it and then. We spent our weekend lazy and. What else can we do speaking. Nothing really. earrings and cleaning the House and tomorrow are going to monitoring spending the night there because he has to do some training. Thursday morning in Monterey so he's like you want to go over and over again, so I took Thursday off just so we can spend the night and then spend the day Monterey."
416.0,Provider,Very cool. Okay.
7788.0,Patient,"But i'm really proud and fester Friday I didn't fester Saturday, and I was like I don't want to talk about this anymore I don't want to feel like this. I hate I hate feeling like this, so I just want to have a place plan your I must."
416.0,Provider,"Have you know just think that sounds great. Okay. And you get right back to your skills, I mean it seems like that's the theme with you lately I just keep seeing you do that. For like okay problem came up i'm going to change my reaction to this i'm going to go back and figure out what skills apply here and i'm going to use them."
7788.0,Patient,"And I used to just. side and just like Oh, whatever Su and then walk away from the room, the only thing I did was stand up from my seat turn my back and then walk back to my toes like. we're thrilled really huge because I usually would stand up grab my keys are. going to the other room and. Exactly, but I just stood up. God anger for a little bit and then sat back down and then I was like I need to I want to do what they have right now i'm i'm ready to talk like. And not and be like not run away."
416.0,Provider,"yeah you stayed present. And there's a mindfulness there too right, I mean mindfulness is so much about like staying focused on the issue right, the one thing that it's about. it's not getting into like our whole relationship it's not getting into it's about like okay there's this one problem we're going to tackle this one thing at a time i'm not going to walk away i'm going to stay. i'm going to use my skills i'm going to be present and we're going to partner this to search for a solution yeah. So you said. it's pretty brilliant. So, are you still going to. couples weekly or how often you going."
7788.0,Patient,"Oh, we were going we pushed back now, before we were doing weekly because of what what's going on and then now we push back to them like ever like we pushed by Julian we're also pushing back. With jazz so we're doing bi weekly now and then she's going to reduce us as we move forward if needed, but there's just little things here and there and I told her like I think bi weekly for a couple it's good. Because there's nothing going on between us in terms of like something crazy but it's always good to constantly talk about liquor flow of communication and things like this, you know he might not it might not be specific to us as a couple but it's specific to josh that affects us. Like Claire."
416.0,Provider,"Absolutely absolutely well it's Okay, it always comes back to these sort of core issues right, and this is very connected to all of them."
7788.0,Patient,"And I mean she was also helpful because there was that. A little bit of resentment that started building up with josh about having kids and it was kind of clarified during our session because. I thought that josh just presented me know or I was presenting him in a way, my friends and colleagues have husbands, are very sympathetic and. Situation of having. The wiser in your life decisions in their careers. And I was in that i'm in that position, and so I was kind of like why doesn't he doesn't understand is like I feel like he's. Not more understanding, like my other colleagues husband and he kind of. It was kind of unfair for me to think that, because he he's like I understand it, but it doesn't mean I don't like it like there's a difference, like, I understand why you did this position, you know, sadly, are in a startup company or in. Limited personnel. And it's just like it's really difficult, so I understand that piece, but doesn't mean I don't like it like I don't like the fact that you have to go through that. I was like okay. it's kind of talked about."
416.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah that makes a lot of sense I mean. that's always fun it's always one of the trickiest couple issues right it's like. How to balance all of that, and when is the right time and somebody is inevitably going to feel like this is the right time and the other one isn't and. You know I mean you guys actually have kind of I guess he's always probably wanted to push forward a little quicker than you but but you've had your moments to go and then things sort of changed right."
7788.0,Patient,"I am I was ready, I was offered. And then know just. I can't. Part of me here's my boss, who is having trying so hard how baby and I know she won't care if we're together but it's like she just had an ectopic pregnancy she's coming off and then she's going to go again for rounds of idea or. Third Round and it's like a part of me is just like I don't part of me feel so bad for her, and I want you to convert. If he and it's just us to. it's just her and mean kind of dealing with this whole vision of this product until we get another person now hopefully come January, when we have a little bit more money in the budget will hire someone then great I have helped. So we could reassess but. Other than that i'm that's what i'm sorry I was just wait till the New Year and kind of just reassessing. See."
416.0,Provider,"I think that makes sense, I mean the New Year is right around the corner."
7788.0,Patient,yeah that's one thing I just can't be bringing up right there when I have to travel.
416.0,Provider,yeah.
7788.0,Patient,"Like i'm okay like i'm. proud of myself this weekend, because that's really one of the biggest things that I cried a little bit I was frustrated, but I didn't do anything to harm myself or. Through divorce or do anything to harm my relationship and self sabotage."
416.0,Provider,"I mean yeah yeah I think you have. it's been pretty amazing actually to. To to sort of watch you progress through all of this, and it has not been easy for you, but you haven't given up."
7788.0,Patient,No more it's constant when the tool and just. kind of learning.
416.0,Provider,yeah you keep practicing I mean you keep coming back to them. And I think last time we talked about maybe using the deer man thing with. With josh next time. We talk about what we did right.
7788.0,Patient,certain situations.
416.0,Provider,yeah. yeah I mean just keeping that like in your back pocket for some of these difficult discussions right for bringing up something you need. I think that that skill is just so helpful I do it every time I well I don't do it every time I wish I did it every time I try to do it every time I have a difficult discussion to have right just because. It is a mindful way to approach the situation and and it's a way to express your wants and needs without automatically starting a fight. And that's tricky.
7788.0,Patient,It is.
416.0,Provider,"yeah. So. I think you're doing great. And I don't remember if we talked about this last time, did we decide to keep you at twice a month or did we decide to go back to once a month. We forgot to."
7788.0,Patient,"Go to once a month, and if we need to increase."
416.0,Provider,"Okay. well. What do you think. Should we schedule, I can always change your mind. Yes, okay."
7788.0,Patient,Because we get older.
416.0,Provider,"yeah let's get your spot okay so, and if we just did to we could do two or three weeks from now to reschedule like three weeks harder."
7788.0,Patient,let's do three weeks.
416.0,Provider,Okay let's do that. And that would be the 19th so we could go back to we could do three o'clock. work.
7788.0,Patient,"Yes, let."
416.0,Provider,me send in a little message here. and have such a hard time remembering your your actual names so used to calling you at.
7788.0,Patient,What our Spanish. bender with my cool they thought we were to people like there's an angelic and an ad and. During our travels.
416.0,Provider,"that's funny yeah. All my all my Spanish friends, including my fiance who Spanish is his first language. He doesn't do this anymore, but almost all my Spanish speaking friends call me call me Julia or even. yeah Leah or Julia they can say the J, but like it's it's never Julie it's always too yeah yeah. yeah."
7788.0,Patient,"They call an elegant well. gee and then the like head of manufacturing over there was, like, I want to start calling you Kelly good I don't like being called America, it was a joke, I mean I don't mind it, but I was just like oh."
416.0,Provider,"that's funny. Okay. well. um, so I think we're set. reach out of any way."
7788.0,Patient,"I will thank you so much, really."
416.0,Provider,appreciate it have a good night.
7788.0,Patient,thanks you too.
