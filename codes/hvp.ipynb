       "\"I can morning. i'm Okay, how are you. that's amazing i'm really happy for you. Oh yeah oh that's really nice. The weather and everything. I mean I, how can I ask for anything nicer. i'm not good not good at all. So i'm. My new therapist suggested that I get on medication or I talk to you about medication for. My Depression and anxiety. cymbalta helps with my anxiety a bit didn't really do anything for my depression and I was taking wellbutrin. For a very long time, I think. And it did work for a while. i've tried lexapro I didn't really like it because I sort of. I don't remember. The six months that I was on it, I just I guess was a robot during that time, but. I don't i'm not. opposed to it, those are just the ones that i've experienced and taken in terms of antidepressants and anti anxiety. i'm having anxiety attacks that last. More than. about an hour hour and a half and. A half have a I have an apple watch that tracks my heartbeat so my heartbeat will be around 121 30 for about an hour straight. It just changes. I said, like one time I started looking for new apartments because we're supposed to. Our lease was up in July, and we were supposed to have found a place, but I I haven't been able to bring myself to start looking because it just seems. It and it did trigger me. Just things like. That it triggers my agoraphobia when I see things that happened like nearby. yeah. and I will go to bed around the same time, every day, but. I will be able to fall asleep. For a while and i'll do all the things that you know the the podcast and and they tell you to do you know don't bring your phone in have a self care routine and. All that. But it just. It just doesn't work and I have a lot of pain in my. my neck I have. arthritis and bulging discs. Two weeks ago, I had a cervical epidural because. My doctor my pain management doctor said that. I really. would benefit from it, but so far it's it's dulled the pain, a little bit, but it hasn't. I think I need to have a talk with him about another shots. i'm not taking any pain medication for that he prescribed. It for me, but I haven't filled the prescription. I just take regular tylenol because okay yeah. i'm sure. anxiety is seems to be the predominant. feeling I have during the day and. When. When I take. When I take the adderall it helps me to. start going about my day you know in in in a fashion that makes sense, you know it's just just get up and do do it, you don't need to. they're overwhelmed with you know what do I do first where where do I start with the easiest what's the fastest. what's the most urgent is I just start doing stuff so that's where the animals really benefited me. But if. If I if i'm coming down from it and i'll start to. lose. I guess will and i'll get caught up in you know. scrolling again and just laying down. From the pain in my neck. Okay. So i'm i'm i'm open to starting. So the amateur explain, will I will take only a bed time. And i'd like to get started. Okay, I trust you. Yes. Okay, and. What would you like to get. What oh sorry, are we on time. Sure um can I get prescriptions for all three and then all of all. i'll keep you updated by email. Okay. Yes, oh sure sure. And I just wanted to thank you for showing up, I wrote like a whole paragraph, but since we're out of time. i'm wanting i'm wanting to affirm the positive consistent things in my life and that's My purpose in invoicing this because i'm I don't want it to seem like you know i'm trying to you know. kiss up or anything I just really want to tell you that. I appreciate that you show up and. you're you've been here since I started therapy. Like in my whole life, and I was i'm so thankful it's you. I just want to read it real quick i'm thankful, it was her, she shown me a quality of care that's redefined my standards, I want to say, I really admire how committed she is to her work and her patients she's so consistent and just thank you for showing up and. Thank you for being my caregiver this year I really appreciate you. Have a habitation and merry Merry Christmas. How about you. Oh, I don't know I feel like it's more about you today because it's like no i'm gonna miss you. And it's a it's been such a great journey, so I don't even really know what to talk about but i'm excited for whatever. chapter by chapter brings. yeah. So that sounds awesome ladies look at the 28th real quick, because that does sound. yeah i'd love to join or i'm gonna put in my calendar 1pm you said. See here with show and tell with Tara at. bright heart. group here. group therapy and that's going to be at 1pm. yep on the Tuesday the 28 Sep tember 20. yeah for sure. Okay. yeah definitely thanks for bringing all that up because it's been such a long not long, but like just we've been through a lot together, and I feel like. When I first started i'm in a totally different place now and. yeah I think you know when I first found bright heart, I was like you know really nervous, I was like I don't know like. You know i'm looking into this company, because I like the website and I like how the therapist present themselves and it looks like they're really serious about. Going into like personal history, but I wasn't sure, because it was like there it's looks it looks like bright. bright heart health mostly focuses on addictions, I was like well you know, maybe I could have like a porn addiction I don't know or or at least I could be vulnerable enough to say that that's something that bothers me. I very nervously. You know, had a conversation with one of the clinicians. Over the phone about my situation, and it was like it was kind of challenging but I was like well at least I took a step to at least getting a therapist and. Then bright hearth bright heart health like exceeded my expectations, because for one like you're just such a great therapist and you just given me so much attention on like my issues that I just felt like I didn't expect that you know, sometimes when you get a therapist. The chemistry just isn't there, like you, don't really feel like you're talking you're agreeing on the same situations that you should be talking about so but that's not the case with you like, I feel like I really connected and. I felt like whatever I brought two bright hearth it was given back so like i'm really glad that I opened up quickly and made myself vulnerable because I felt like I got more out of the Program. Because of that, you know. Just coming being direct just saying everything right up front like this is what's bothering me so. And you know when I first had my first conversation with you, I received my second Madonna dose and. I was like yeah like you know my my half brother lorenzen he was traumatized by CSA and i'm also having feelings of guilt and shame whenever I do watch pornography so like. I just I have all these feelings, but I don't really know what to do with them, or how to address them, maybe a therapist can help me and then that's when you that's when you started using this language like you know, maybe there doesn't have to be judgment. You know, maybe you could focus on you and if something comes out of that with. With Lorenzo and and you can move forward with that. My approach to like overcoming that first hurdle was like well, maybe I could write a letter either to myself or to my family that just really goes into explicit detail about how I feel about the situation i'm in in relation to my family. So I feel like that's where a lot of the initial kind of damage was done. And then, how does that show up in my daily life now. And I think partly the way that it shows up is that. i'm more and more of a place of acceptance about shame and guilt around our sexual or sexuality as a shared kind of phenomenon, however, it doesn't have to be so dramatic. and And the other thing was that with Lorenzo and when I met with him about a month ago, when I was seeing my mom you know he's just his own person if he has the strength to open up. By all means i'm a wonderful person to listen to him, but we don't know how the universe, is going to play out, but I think ultimately i'm just glad that I took steps on myself. So that I am in a place of you know, receiving I can receive whatever lorenzen has to give me if that's what you choose to do. yeah yeah yeah, I think, overall, looking back it seems like the best things that are around the corner often are scary at first, because they're just such a huge change. And you know I didn't know anything about bright hearth by heart health it just looked like an addiction Center and and I was, but I think, maybe that's what. attracted me is because that's the level of urgency that I felt with myself, is that I, I wanted to address this urgently and I wanted to go deeply into it. So it was a little scary at first so i'm glad that maybe that. Maybe that will inspire me or motivate me to. make other big changes if that's something that comes up in the future. Well, I I don't know if there's something that's the most challenging but when I go back to the feeling of what it felt like when I first called them. It was like well I don't I don't necessarily know that I identify as someone who's addicted I don't necessarily identify as someone who was hurt however i'm i'm being challenged by the inner conflict about. what's showing up in my daily life so and. And maybe I could address some issues, I guess, if I go all the way back if it felt like the biggest challenge was you know what is my responsibility, what Should I be doing. But then we kind of changed the language, a little bit sorry it was like. Instead of should like maybe there's possibility within myself, maybe there's possibility within relationships so. Maybe just initially feeling like feeling the judgment feeling the like I should do something was kind of a weight and then, as we started doing therapy, the language changed and the weight started to lift a little bit. So, but in term in regards to bright heart health as a agency I don't necessarily know that anything was particularly challenging or enjoyed the. group yeah I enjoyed the personal sessions with you. I think one is that I, I feel like i'm kind of naturally receptive and naturally good at listening, I naturally enjoy. Being in the groups and hearing other people's stories and I like being the space for other people, so I feel like there's kind of a kinship with other therapists it's like well that could be another door for me in the future, like or just. Being being that role or figure of someone who's has that open space for someone maybe not necessarily a therapist maybe a spiritual teacher, but like I feel like that's just an appropriate role or activity for me. And then number two is that. Already forgot what I was gonna say. yeah but yeah I. Oh, I remember. And just usually, when I come to therapy i'm kind of pleasantly surprised. To hear other people's feedback, because that I learned things I didn't consider, for example, like. You just happen to know this yoga breath and I continue to that 555 every day now and I when I learned it from me, I was like maybe i'll use it, maybe I won't but it ended up being a big tool for me, so I used it today, you know so. So, like I enjoy I guess my biggest takeaway from breitbart health is that it's a good resource to have because I don't really know. i'm kind of pleasantly surprised by other people like whatever they suggest to me another example was the the wellness coach she suggested all these things to me that could happen in my daily routine that. never even considered before and they definitely did have an impact, a big impact, when I took action on them. I haven't quite thought that far ahead i'm also a little bit anticipating possibly not having health insurance for a little while and not having access to a therapist. Part of me says that's Okay, because you know there's ups and downs to not working enough to. Have health insurance one is that. I have more time to work on my artwork and also it just gives me more time to reflect, which I feel like. i'm being generous to myself when I when i'm giving myself time away from work. But the downside is like well you won't have health insurance for six months, and you won't have access to a therapist for six months so it's like is that worth it, I don't know so it's a big decision that i'm kind of winging right now. And I kind of have to. I have to kind of act on that within by October, I guess, but but i'll still have bright heart health through. October and November, I believe. Okay, but i'll let i'll let the clinicians know that you know i'll probably make a decision soon about what I need to do. But yeah if I mean maybe I will decide to keep the health insurance and i'll continue with bright heart but within the two months that I do have it i'm not sure what all what i'll be talking about with that person yeah. i'm good I feels like we're a well oiled and mechanized again, you know we're working together again. yeah I feel I still feel like I can see myself living here for quite some time. Because I feel like at the end of the day, there's just less financial pressure on me because I don't have to pay rent. And it's just it's such a huge. aspect of me feeling kind of. generous to myself it's like well you know, at the end of the day, all you don't really have to worry about anything you have food on the table, you have a roof over your head so it's like it's nothing, nothing urgent is pressing down. You know, but. And you know my mental health and her mental health, they kind of fluctuate so it's like i'm trying to just be patient with both of us, but overall, I feel like it's been fairly good. it's that's one thing that's i've never been totally. Like romantic relationships is not something that i'm inclined to like pursue like with. Like a high on the priority list it's always something that I just kind of put back on the back burner like. yeah maybe it'll be in a relationship, maybe not but maybe it's because i'm just so comfortable being single that I just don't really. that's just my comfort zone so but part of me wants to like maybe take a risk and like invite someone on a picnic or something or just like you know just do something like that I don't know. But overall at work. it's. I had a really fun day, the other day we did 70s day. So I I picked out my my hair into like a huge Afro and like. so hard to find here in northern California, so I. So I did a color scheme of. You know, like that 70s, like Beige Brown and gold. Like the gold chains and the chest hair and. A half row and everyone was just like yes. I didn't. hippie well you know it is still coven time so I feel like the there's an undercurrent of depression just all throughout so. The few brave of us who the few of us were brave enough to do it, it was only like five people who actually did it. They were applauded. So it was it was funny for those who did it. I think I probably won the contest i'm not sure i'd have to check tomorrow but. um my managers loved it and yeah it was just a fun activity i'm glad I did it. And in terms of the moving forward with. becoming part of the sign team. i'm there's a lot of chess pieces moving around it in the workplace right now we're you know we're losing we're getting new managers and there's a new store opening that's near so like a lot of pieces are shifting around so. it's kind of hard for me to get a word in in terms of like you know what can I do here so like i'm just waiting for things to kind of settle down a little bit, so I can kind of step in, but today, while I was doing some yard work for my grandma I thought of a good. proposal, which is that I can help organize and color Code, the. Some of the chalkboard signs, so that we can save time and energy with that so maybe I could just propose that, as a small entry level projects so that I can at least get some attention. With what i'm doing yeah. yeah. I would say just navigating where my grandmother is that emotionally every. So so that's a challenge and then also just kind of wondering what my financial situation could be you know because I. Because I have like 31,000 in student loan debt, but I haven't really touched and i'm kind of wondering, could I be doing more to address that situation because i'm I think pretty soon going to be paying pretty large payments towards that because i'm in a good financial situation here. So i'm just kind of wondering, you know what my financial situation could look like for the future, so probably grandma and the financial situation. it's been an ideal therapy session i'm not expecting all therapists to be like this, so I got a good. Had a therapist once. Okay, not not nearly as it was an under under performing underwhelming experience kind of a disappointing experience there wasn't some slight some slight help there, but just totally different time in my life totally different mindset. yeah that during that time of my life I probably wasn't even aware of how many resources at my disposal I just I just noticed that there was a therapy clinic near my home. In and just propose to get a therapist but didn't really have any particular goals in mind, but when I entered in bright heart, I did my homework I I. intention. And a very specific intention. And I you know I took some time browsing therapists on the. What is it called Blue Shield website, or whatever. Right, so I was just browsing and looking at different therapists but yeah I just totally different approach, this time, so. Tough. Know i'm totally totally open to a meditation. Thank you for that that space. mm hmm. yeah there was a great grounding and. I needed that I missed it makes me miss doing that I would do groundings for my anti racist work. I haven't been involved in the anti racist groups for quite some time but that's one probably one of the biggest things I miss about it as being able to do the groundings. yeah yeah. yeah It makes me wonder i'm like I wonder, it feels like that could be. Something that can be in my daily life, like in a group setting. I wonder if someone some other people would be interested in just doing groundings maybe once a week or something. I just for some reason I spontaneously thought of the deer that Rome this area just kind of a deer like a baby doe kind of wandering into. And I have done some exploring in the area and sometimes i'll just wander off. into the woods and there's lots of deer you know just kind of watching me watching them and. You know just really gentle creatures just kind of minding their own business it's really beautiful. Totally and I think and even for people who are inclined to do that when I get still in front of other people, it can be embarrassing, but I tell myself, you know accept accept that you're embarrassed that you're being still accept that this is not. socially acceptable accept that this is not mainstream and let that bring you deeper you know. really appreciate you bringing me into that space and. yeah I definitely feels like something that could it's like something that I need that I could. Take seize the opportunity to do. To help me stay engaged with you know stillness and presence, you know, maybe I could start like a grounding session once a week with some people I don't know. on it. Well, you just keep being. I look forward to bringing whatever I bring to the show until I have your email in case I want to send pictures but. hey carrie. i'm Okay, how are you. yeah. Oh yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah me too. i'm. Well, much. Nothing nothing in particular. I am weary it is i'm. Just. A lot been on my mind recently um since our last session you recommended Tara Brock. And I love her. yeah um. it's. and I don't know what it like if it says in my file but um. I I do a lot of work in the off time just because we only have one session every few weeks so. isn't. No i'm supposed to get an hour. Back to me. yeah. Sorry, I wasn't expecting to have like half an hour and. I guess, since I do have sessions every two weeks, I really look forward to our sessions our one on one session. And, but back to Terra Brock she's been an immense comfort for me. and I just love her voice and the way she speaks. Well, it, I mean i'm i'm not employed right now and. And so you know and. My husband's the only one working so. it's. You know it's just it's kind of hard it's a you know I know people make mistakes it's it's not an intentional thing it's okay. It happens. yeah it does it's just um. I isolated myself a lot in the past couple of years and i'm. Opening up to friends has been kind of not an option for me because everybody's going through something. And, and you know. it's just been difficult i'm. Starting therapy this year and opening up to strangers that you've never met about. shift that's happened to you that's pretty traumatizing and kind of you know, the rail. Whereas going in life. And i'm inconsistency, you know it's just not. it's not great for me. But um. Okay, so let's make the most of the half hour, we do have, and then I will see you again next week. So. hmm. I hope they do people do need help and. Lee amounts of yes, a. and yeah. So um. I watched this psychologist on YouTube her duck her name is Dr Romani and she specializes in Narcissus. And it wasn't until this year that I really got into. naming the issues that. That my parents had read that my mom hat. And i'm. So to maximize you know our time together, I try to remember you know with my limited memory. Something that have that I want to bring up with you, you know and sort of untangle together. And i'm I struggle with issues of. People just straight denying you know or dismissing what's going on with me and I feel small. yeah so. i'm sorry it's just. So I isolated myself and. I don't go out much. And I, I was one of the only people out of. You know my friends and acquaintances that like really listen to you know California has mandates for you know social distancing and and staying at home and all of that stuff and. it's just been really you know. really difficult for me to. manage bringing up all this stuff and then you know with Tara leaving and. That was really. I don't know um it was. It was really strange going through that but I kind of had to process it. On my own and like I spoke with. A couple of very close friends who go to therapy as well, and not with bright heart, they have their own. Right and they get. An hour a week. Yes, with their therapists and. We all started around the same time we're all around the same age. and they're just like I can't imagine. What would happen if my therapist left me and. i've had to kind of reconcile it as. A therapist is kind of like a. Like a semester at school, you know they're there to teach you. And you've got a certain amount of time it's not going to be forever, you know so learn what you can from them and. enjoy the time that you guys have together. But it's been difficult it's been difficult for me to to do that, you know case. yeah I mean. Well um yeah I yeah I would, I would say, show, yes, it was a very good experience um. But yeah. yeah. yeah it's just like you know i'm. Like times are hard right now, and you know this. About about everybody, but also about me um it's just you know I don't want to waste money i'm. Just you know. So that's why I really do the work I. I go and I revisit things in my past and. i'm. i'm turning 40 next year. i'm. it's just so unstable. I don't have any kids. i'm not i'm not in a position to have children. Financially mentally emotionally. The best thing that I could do is to. is to not have good yeah i'm filled with fear and doubt, am I doing the right thing, am I doing is my husband just going along with it, if he he's very supportive, you know, and of course he's you know he's going to go with what what they say and. Thinking about that recently about. myself as a kid i'm. Like I know my family is is. Everybody on my mom's side. This abusive down to my grandfather. I was actually. My grandfather would. join in and. hit me if my mom was upset with me at the time and i'm. I don't want to bring anybody into that. i'm not i'm not in contact with my carrots and then my grandfather my grandparents are dead, but. I, you know as a woman, you just like. Sometimes you want it sometimes you don't. But. I know. The right answer is to not. costs. You don't to create your own field. So I have a lot of doubt, I don't know if I know i'm doing the right thing, but sometimes you know. you hear you hear people say that you know Oh, you know how the kid is the most healing thing you can do I don't want to have a kid so that I can heal I just I don't want to have a kid I just don't know if i'm doing. You know the right thing in my life, and I have problems with my worth because i'm housewife right now and I never imagined myself as a housewife but. When I first started there one of my goals was, I wanted to be a productive member of society, you know. But anyway, i'm. I don't know I don't think so. I think i'm a productive member of this family. between my husband and I but. I don't feel that I contribute in any meaningful way. When i'd like to. yeah sure. Thank you. times almost. and um. I I had like a flashback i'm. crying children are very. stressful for me. um and I remember. I tried to reconcile with my mom I tried to go back and. I. One time we were out. Together, and there was you know, a child who was acting up and screaming and crying and and. My mom. said to me, you know if that was you. You would have been in the bathroom already and I would have beat the shit out of you. In the bathroom. When you were young. And I was really shocked, she said that, and then I said. wow like you did that, which is like yeah you know I had to teach you how to act in public. she's a she's a very textbook. narcissist she's a covert narcissist. and she'll apologize when the words there of her, yes, but her behavior doesn't change and she still considers herself. You know. She says what she's doing is right time. You know. With them it's just always right for them not really right. Overall. I know, like just. The reason why we're no contact right now is because last year during the pandemic. My parents are incredibly German phobic and. Be live half an hour and 40 minutes away from me, and I would go every couple of weeks, and I would buy all of their groceries I would fill my SUV with. trader joes costco you know the Korean market just. groceries enough for. Two weeks or more. And then i'm. Their trump supporters and. I. I just don't believe in what. trump supporters believe in I don't believe, the intention is this good. And whether or not you know they're right, the people who do believe in supporting him. They take his ideology and use it for. Just to justify a lot of really horrible things. And I don't believe politics should should do that because we're more evolved than that you know. um. But anyway, um I would try to talk to them, and I would try to say like do you really think that you know this is good for us what's happening, and this was in the midst of the pandemic last year, so it was a lot of writing going on and. A lot of. Just things that were not good. And they walked out from my house, I had invited them over for lunch or whatever, and they walked out the left of their own accord. And then she went and she lied to everybody in my family and said that I kicked her out and i'm. They sold their house which they've been living in for 30 years 20 years and they moved to Pennsylvania to live near my younger brother who is. An air force doctor. and They told everybody that it was because of me that they. They moved across the country, it was because of me that they you know sold their house and that they had felt they blamed their isolation from the pandemic they blamed it all on me. i'm. who's been doing that my whole life i'm. Both of my grandparents passed away thinking, I was just this terrible person who was born to make her life hell. yeah is that the other person show up. We lucked out or I like that. But yeah. Thank you for that. My my grandmother never abused me she was and she was abused by my grandfather. And she could only helplessly sit by. A while she saw my mom and. My grandfather. My mostly my mom and she she didn't speak English very well. But she would always tell me to have a big heart and an open mind, and I think. She said that to try to help me get through it, because she saw. that's okay. that's okay. Thanks i'll See you in group tomorrow. Thank. How are you hi i'm Okay, how are you. Yes, please. i'm okay i'm. happy to talk to you looking forward to it. I wanted to thank you um. The the time that I signed on and you're in session. I guess the appointment had got messed up and. You had said. right before we hung up he said I hope everything's okay with you. and I. Or, I really appreciate it that. yeah yeah yeah. um. So I had a couple of things that I wanted to talk about first get out of the way. Okay um so the agoraphobia things like walking outside by myself um I think. For now. I. it's going to be extremely like almost a hard know for me. Just because. Recently there's been so many attacks on people and you know those follow home robberies and. um I I prefer right just for now. i'm not ready. To just work on myself. yeah. I yeah i'm not ready to go go outside like on my own and stuff. yeah yeah when he's there yeah it's no problem, like we we went and got our boosters. yeah and. I don't know if you got yours, but I feel like I got socked in my armpit. Really swollen and just. yeah it's not a. yeah yeah i've never been sucked in my armpit before but that I imagine in like my my lymph node is fallen on my arm it's it's very. Good for it yeah. um. yeah. I don't think i'm ready to work on the agoraphobia thing just because i'm. feel like there's a lot of mental and personal issues that. I can work on with you first. Okay yeah. Okay um another Another thing I really wanted to talk to you about when i'm. So I went I went no contact with my family. yeah and they my my mom I don't know why, but she blames me for her. Selling her house and moving to Pennsylvania from torrance. But um my pets are playing that's that's been really nice um. She likes to get sympathy from like family members, she lies. about me a lot. My grandma kind of did that with my on like my when my grandma was living by herself and my aunt would go and like try to take care of her my grandma would complain to her other children like Oh, you know. Lisa doesn't come she doesn't see me that office you don't take care of me. Which wasn't true, but I think she used it to gain sympathy, you know from her family members and that's kind of a pattern that I think my mom does she does it too much worse degree like. I. So a month ago, I had. A video of my dog she was. figuring out a little dog puzzle. He figured it out in under two minutes, and it was really proud of her for that. And my parents really love my dogs. And my dogs really love them, so I I sent it in a group chat I sent the video in a group pet to my my parents. my brother and his wife. And nobody responded, except for my brother's wife. And then I kind of had a breakdown that date. Like my husband and I fought. i'm pretty sure I took it out on him. And we're Okay, we move past it. And then on thanksgiving I spent thanksgiving greetings in the group chat okay again only my brother's wife responded. um so I wanted to run this by you. yeah and see what you thought so. Christmas i'm i'm thinking of. Sending a text saying you know, this is my last. greeting for holidays or. special occasions. I wish you the best and. it's not out of malice but i'm protecting my peace. so happy. You know this is. And and and that's it. I haven't really planned out the wording of it but. i'm. yeah as a way to say like this is like Merry Christmas Happy New Year. This is my last special occasion text to you guys. Because i'm going to protect my peace now. Where I don't know. The wording, but. yeah definitely. haven't thought it through, because I wanted to talk to you about it first. I want to take my power back. And this is directed towards my parents, mostly because I have an okay relationship with my brother and his wife. yeah we don't we don't fight or have conflict he's six years younger she's the same age as him and. You know they're both busy in their their daily lives and her family's out there, so she you know. Like i'm. I told them in October that i'm not i'm not doing Christmas gifts. That this year, I want to skip doing Christmas gifts and that was the one text that my mom did respond she just wrote okay. um but on the side my brother and I are just going to send each other, like gifts for each other's pets. And like little chocolate like i'm sending him some chocolate like it um. But yeah this is mostly from my parents. And so you're like. know this is my last text. i'm not sending texts in 2022. No, I don't want to send like Happy Birthday or happy mother's day or anything like that I don't every time I send a text like that happy thanksgiving. And they don't respond. i'm. It hurts a lot. Because you know. I say Merry Christmas to like strangers like you know. grocery store, you know clerks. I it's not a thing for me. it's not it's just common courtesy to do wish someone a happy thanksgiving. yeah and. You know your family doesn't even respond happy thanksgiving to you too. yeah I just feel like it's So if I mean. yeah too yeah. yeah I think I think i'm gonna do that. If you don't see any like negative. i'm. i'm sorry we're. Stop um. How do I feel in terms of cutting them off. i'm Okay, with it, I. i'm Okay, with it, I need to work on on myself, I need to become. Whole I need to become a person my own person and. and I haven't gotten. any type of closure or um. You know, when people will apologize, and you know they they say it, but they don't act it. Like my parents, they don't act it like. i've heard her say I heard her say like you know. Oh i'm sorry. I treated you like that, but then she keeps acting like this, you know so it's just words it's not real. it's just saying stuff to make herself feel better that Oh, you know, whatever I did wrong i'm sorry there I said it, you know if you don't live it it's not real. Well, to me, at least. i'm. So i'm okay with it i'm okay with yeah cutting them off and just for next year, I mean well, we can reevaluate i'm not saying this is permanent. yeah because nothing's permanent but for now like, I feel like. You need to keep awake. and basically playing my path. yeah. You know yeah yeah. um, how can I work on it, and then in the in our next session i'll. Yes, I think our next session is before Christmas. yeah so. Christmas i'll read it to you. Okay, that session. Thank you um I started zoloft I made an appointment with shontelle and on your recommendation and she started me on zoloft. And you Spar. Okay, I take I take it up. yeah the adderall during the day, and then I take the zoloft at night. My husband has shown. To he said that even though it's been a week only because they but they said that it takes two weeks start. But um it's only been a week since i've been taking it in. But he says he feels different it feels different. mm hmm like yeah the vibe he's getting for me so. yeah yeah I feel less anxious to. What do you have any opinion on um I don't know if i'm saying his name right in a cart poli a carton. So in our last session, you told me to look up. My yeah on YouTube so I did, and then you know you go down that hole. And just YouTube just takes you places yeah ECHO totally was one of the teachers or. When spirituals like college teachers I don't know. um so I watched one of his videos. Like a few times. The one where there's one where he says that people can get addicted to negative thinking. and So, every time. Since I saw that video that I start thinking negatively. mm hmm i've been. Trying to you know, like we should be mindful. But also thinking like look, this is, this is an addiction have like you're going back for your fix. You think so I get. yeah it's helped me. Think of it in a different way, the. My mindset that. That i've been thinking this way for so long that i've been addicted to it mmm. That makes sense to me. Like it may not be applicable for everybody, but. yeah it makes sense for me that. Maybe maybe it's, not that I I like negative thinking, but you just get so used to it and. It becomes a habit. An addiction that like this is this is how I feel normal because i've been feeling like this for so long. So that that's one of the things in the past few weeks that i've been showing on. Do you think it's. Like you just decide. i'm not going to. i'm not going to. Be traumatized by this anymore. I wish it was as easy as that. No there's no much. You know, we need. I need you, we need you know so much. yeah um. So um. um. i'd like to talk about my. My anxiety for medication. i'm like. When I asked for refills when I need refills. I feel like a drug seeker. hmm but then I don't feel like that about weed I don't feel like that about cannabis. Like the adderall really help. I do. feel like I struggle so much with executive dysfunction. and emotional dysregulation. and adderall just makes it simple for me. um. But then there's that you know, like you know those 1950s. So the wives that take. feed, and then they go vacuum. You know the whole House. That like trope I don't get it. I feel that that shame, I guess, when I talked to even you about taking adderall like I feel like. I have ADHD imposter. syndrome yeah. But like I you know I watch videos with people who have ADHD themselves, and I do a lot of you know. Indigenous independent work on it, you know the workbook i'm still working through it, the ADHD for adults by Dr barkley. Like the stuff in the workbook it all hits you know. But then you hear about. Like Oh, you know people have ADHD. Like traits. Like everybody struggles with. A little bit of executive dysfunction a little bit of. This emotional dysregulation but. I don't. I don't know I don't know how to get over my. imposter syndrome about it. um So when I went to see my. My GP um. He I told him that I I stopped taking cymbalta and. That chantelle had prescribed. at all for me and then he just gave me this whole speech about how um you know students come in wanting to patch patch. and perform better and. Adult. hmm. yeah yeah. yeah i'm not a student and. I don't know um. I wasn't asking him. You know, for an ad. For adderall prescription, I was just letting him know so that he could put it in my records that. i'm not taking cymbalta anymore and i'm on this medication. I should change GPS. I have. Here I. I don't take it on the weekend. um. Because of that stigma. Because I feel like if if if i'm able to not take it on the weekends, then i'm not really addicted and i'm not addicted to it, though that's the thing. Okay. i'm. Okay. I don't feel this way about the Zola. More than you are just. You know people can't get. Okay. In our first few sessions you're very still. I mean like. Maybe a lot of space. Oh no I didn't hear you just fine. yeah yeah. The first. Few sessions yeah. And I did think about it, like over the weeks, I was like this that is that how she's gonna be or is that, like her superpower to like let me get it all out so that. No, no. I know I trust I trust your brain. and your training that I know you've got this you know that's why. that's why you're here yeah. yeah so yeah. But um. yeah I was. I was really. In a lot of pain before. mm hmm but i'm ready to. go in a much more. Progressive direction. Okay yeah with your guidance. Please help me. I do want better mental health, yes. I want to. I want to be more authentic. I want to be able to be authentic with. Myself and and the people in my life. Instead of scared and. I feel like i'm a crumpled piece of paper and I just need. to smooth it all out, you know. i'd like to be a productive member of society. A goal, I guess, would be to be. To to own my own. place in this world, I don't know if that makes sense. But I i'd like to walk around not being. In pain are so fearful. Sometimes I feel like. Maybe it's the way I love or. i'm how I hold myself, but I feel like people. Can just. Tell that i'm not confident and. i'm. yeah. yeah yeah yeah. Yes. that's. Okay i've always been very sensitive and. i'm like I cry the drop of a hat. mm hmm ever since I was little then like I remember asking my friend in middle school like how come, you will cry anymore like she was my best friend, since you know kindergarten and then a middle school something changed and then she she just didn't cry anymore and. I asked her and she's like oh yeah you know, so my boyfriend just told me like don't cry. And I didn't. I don't I didn't get it, and I still don't try to you know cuz. When I feel the urge to cry just Kurdish. i'd like i'd like to not i'm. not let my family get to me so much I don't I don't really have any conflicts with my friends. mm hmm um. Yes. Yes, I don't think I can I can, or I don't think it's good for me to be in contact with them well I try to. What learn these girls that yeah. yeah um it's it's too painful and. I feel like i'm. Like you know I don't know candy for her. You know she just she can't resist. And that's that's how she gets her supply. Is by. McLeish. yeah yeah. yeah. um I almost feel like pray. to her. I don't understand why i'm her. it's not even adversary, I guess pray is a good word but um but I don't I don't know if there's even a good answer because maybe that's just how she is you know and. My dad he he loves her so much and he. he's fallen into that that narcissistic trap that you know when you get in a relationship with a narcissistic person like if you don't get out of it, you just completely fall. fall into it and become. One of their flying monkeys you know. yeah and. he's he's stressed her main monkey. And I think. I have to grieve that I have to grieve this relationship, yes that's something I would like to work on is i'd like to grieve my relationship with my parents. This is a good question. I didn't even think about that. So i'd like your guidance on how to properly and health in a healthy way. read it, so that I can move past it so that they can no longer. hurt me. Okay. I started a new group. A new group. that's okay my old group was on Tuesdays with Karen my old therapist the one who, who I only had a couple sessions with. mm hmm I didn't. I didn't want to change group because i'm not right i'm not really great with change. And there were some some people in that group that you know, like you, you get used to them. But um. yeah so I it was time I thought I. was ready until last week I started a new group. On Fridays with yeah. I don't know her she's just a different person. yeah but shauntel still. Like it's. yeah it's still under her. mm hmm it's one of her still. Okay yeah that. The group. The first group wish. Okay i'm going to be. Okay, I feel more comfortable with people of color. Because I you know i'm i'm. and I feel like there are a lot of things that people of color understand differently. And tuesday's group had you know all kinds. and This new group i'm not sure, but you know i'm willing to try something new, like to make to make that switch is is hard for me, but once i'm in it i'm okay with it. So, like change is hard for that initial like. You know, like okay i'm going to call them and. Change the group and stuff but once i'm in it i'm like okay like let's try this let's give it a shot. yeah there's only one person of color in this new group, so I don't know. You know. And we can yeah. yeah yeah i'm okay with that, but i'm i'm okay with with you know the mostly white group it's just. That was one of the reasons why I stayed in the Tuesday group. yeah because we all talked about stuff that I could relate to. But maybe it's just because it was my first group that I didn't I didn't really relate to these people. yeah. yeah. I had an exact like severe anxiety attack. i'm supposed to move we're supposed to move. For kevin's work kevin's my husband. We are least one up in in July, and then we went month to month after and um I was supposed to find a new place by July, but we did it and we still haven't moved yet December. We tried looking up some places last week and then I had a really severe. anxiety attack my heart rate was like 130 for about an hour. And I haven't I haven't tried again. I just got overwhelmed like you know I need to find a good place with neighbors that are not noisy and like somewhere safe that I can walk the dogs and like. Within our price range and. yeah I just I just need I don't know what I need to I need something to. Well i'm writing this down. Okay, I read, I was listening to a podcast and he had to write write in your journal with when you're with your therapist so that you can. Remember, everything that they say. i'm sure. or looking at housing. Like okay like don't only do it for like a certain amount of time sure like Okay, I only have to do this for an hour. Okay okay yeah I think I could do that yeah reasonable yeah. Okay. Look yeah. yeah yeah. Okay. um. Okay, I can do that. it'll probably be good for Kevin. You can take my meetings. yeah. Do you think whenever I feel chantel I want to tell her like how thankful, I am. For her. because she ever since I started therapy and I think may she she was my kind of trust. And, and it hasn't changed like she hasn't left the company or anything and she's been very. Like. Just she does her job really well. And every time I have appointments with her, I always want to tell her like you. know I really appreciate you just for showing up and. Thank you for like all your work and stuff but i'm i'm starting to wonder is it is it a trauma response, like a fun trauma response. We think it makes other person uncomfortable. Okay. Okay i've been feeling kind of guilty about it, or just maybe wondering if it's a fun fun trauma response, because I do tell people like I watched head last oh. I like that show a lot. and You know I I thought it's so nice to practice appreciation so i've been trying to do that more, but then I get in my head so often like Oh, is this a trauma response. For are you practicing appreciation. i'm not. You know, know. I it's I can't I can't it's hard for me to be fake because. there's so much in my head that I can't juggle all of this. All of the everything in my head. You know, on top of that managing being being fake and like oh so I usually just end up not having a response, like to people. And I think that might come off wrong, maybe or not well received, I don't know, but I just usually. don't respond. I don't know. yeah I just sort of freeze and I don't know. What what the appropriate thing to do is, but I just I just don't do anything. I feel like yeah. Maybe I should learn to. respond. If. it's like you know that's important socially right. To respond. Which is not, I mean not in a fake way, but to. talkative. just getting it. and OK OK OK i'll see you then take care of yourself. You too okay bye bye.\""

       "\"I can morning. i'm Okay, how are you. that's amazing i'm really happy for you. Oh yeah oh that's really nice. The weather and everything. I mean I, how can I ask for anything nicer. i'm not good not good at all. So i'm. My new therapist suggested that I get on medication or I talk to you about medication for. My Depression and anxiety. cymbalta helps with my anxiety a bit didn't really do anything for my depression and I was taking wellbutrin. For a very long time, I think. And it did work for a while. i've tried lexapro I didn't really like it because I sort of. I don't remember. The six months that I was on it, I just I guess was a robot during that time, but. I don't i'm not. opposed to it, those are just the ones that i've experienced and taken in terms of antidepressants and anti anxiety. i'm having anxiety attacks that last. More than. about an hour hour and a half and. A half have a I have an apple watch that tracks my heartbeat so my heartbeat will be around 121 30 for about an hour straight. It just changes. I said, like one time I started looking for new apartments because we're supposed to. Our lease was up in July, and we were supposed to have found a place, but I I haven't been able to bring myself to start looking because it just seems. It and it did trigger me. Just things like. That it triggers my agoraphobia when I see things that happened like nearby. yeah. and I will go to bed around the same time, every day, but. I will be able to fall asleep. For a while and i'll do all the things that you know the the podcast and and they tell you to do you know don't bring your phone in have a self care routine and. All that. But it just. It just doesn't work and I have a lot of pain in my. my neck I have. arthritis and bulging discs. Two weeks ago, I had a cervical epidural because. My doctor my pain management doctor said that. I really. would benefit from it, but so far it's it's dulled the pain, a little bit, but it hasn't. I think I need to have a talk with him about another shots. i'm not taking any pain medication for that he prescribed. It for me, but I haven't filled the prescription. I just take regular tylenol because okay yeah. i'm sure. anxiety is seems to be the predominant. feeling I have during the day and. When. When I take. When I take the adderall it helps me to. start going about my day you know in in in a fashion that makes sense, you know it's just just get up and do do it, you don't need to. they're overwhelmed with you know what do I do first where where do I start with the easiest what's the fastest. what's the most urgent is I just start doing stuff so that's where the animals really benefited me. But if. If I if i'm coming down from it and i'll start to. lose. I guess will and i'll get caught up in you know. scrolling again and just laying down. From the pain in my neck. Okay. So i'm i'm i'm open to starting. So the amateur explain, will I will take only a bed time. And i'd like to get started. Okay, I trust you. Yes. Okay, and. What would you like to get. What oh sorry, are we on time. Sure um can I get prescriptions for all three and then all of all. i'll keep you updated by email. Okay. Yes, oh sure sure. And I just wanted to thank you for showing up, I wrote like a whole paragraph, but since we're out of time. i'm wanting i'm wanting to affirm the positive consistent things in my life and that's My purpose in invoicing this because i'm I don't want it to seem like you know i'm trying to you know. kiss up or anything I just really want to tell you that. I appreciate that you show up and. you're you've been here since I started therapy. Like in my whole life, and I was i'm so thankful it's you. I just want to read it real quick i'm thankful, it was her, she shown me a quality of care that's redefined my standards, I want to say, I really admire how committed she is to her work and her patients she's so consistent and just thank you for showing up and. Thank you for being my caregiver this year I really appreciate you. Have a habitation and merry Merry Christmas. How about you. Oh, I don't know I feel like it's more about you today because it's like no i'm gonna miss you. And it's a it's been such a great journey, so I don't even really know what to talk about but i'm excited for whatever. chapter by chapter brings. yeah. So that sounds awesome ladies look at the 28th real quick, because that does sound. yeah i'd love to join or i'm gonna put in my calendar 1pm you said. See here with show and tell with Tara at. bright heart. group here. group therapy and that's going to be at 1pm. yep on the Tuesday the 28 Sep tember 20. yeah for sure. Okay. yeah definitely thanks for bringing all that up because it's been such a long not long, but like just we've been through a lot together, and I feel like. When I first started i'm in a totally different place now and. yeah I think you know when I first found bright heart, I was like you know really nervous, I was like I don't know like. You know i'm looking into this company, because I like the website and I like how the therapist present themselves and it looks like they're really serious about. Going into like personal history, but I wasn't sure, because it was like there it's looks it looks like bright. bright heart health mostly focuses on addictions, I was like well you know, maybe I could have like a porn addiction I don't know or or at least I could be vulnerable enough to say that that's something that bothers me. I very nervously. You know, had a conversation with one of the clinicians. Over the phone about my situation, and it was like it was kind of challenging but I was like well at least I took a step to at least getting a therapist and. Then bright hearth bright heart health like exceeded my expectations, because for one like you're just such a great therapist and you just given me so much attention on like my issues that I just felt like I didn't expect that you know, sometimes when you get a therapist. The chemistry just isn't there, like you, don't really feel like you're talking you're agreeing on the same situations that you should be talking about so but that's not the case with you like, I feel like I really connected and. I felt like whatever I brought two bright hearth it was given back so like i'm really glad that I opened up quickly and made myself vulnerable because I felt like I got more out of the Program. Because of that, you know. Just coming being direct just saying everything right up front like this is what's bothering me so. And you know when I first had my first conversation with you, I received my second Madonna dose and. I was like yeah like you know my my half brother lorenzen he was traumatized by CSA and i'm also having feelings of guilt and shame whenever I do watch pornography so like. I just I have all these feelings, but I don't really know what to do with them, or how to address them, maybe a therapist can help me and then that's when you that's when you started using this language like you know, maybe there doesn't have to be judgment. You know, maybe you could focus on you and if something comes out of that with. With Lorenzo and and you can move forward with that. My approach to like overcoming that first hurdle was like well, maybe I could write a letter either to myself or to my family that just really goes into explicit detail about how I feel about the situation i'm in in relation to my family. So I feel like that's where a lot of the initial kind of damage was done. And then, how does that show up in my daily life now. And I think partly the way that it shows up is that. i'm more and more of a place of acceptance about shame and guilt around our sexual or sexuality as a shared kind of phenomenon, however, it doesn't have to be so dramatic. and And the other thing was that with Lorenzo and when I met with him about a month ago, when I was seeing my mom you know he's just his own person if he has the strength to open up. By all means i'm a wonderful person to listen to him, but we don't know how the universe, is going to play out, but I think ultimately i'm just glad that I took steps on myself. So that I am in a place of you know, receiving I can receive whatever lorenzen has to give me if that's what you choose to do. yeah yeah yeah, I think, overall, looking back it seems like the best things that are around the corner often are scary at first, because they're just such a huge change. And you know I didn't know anything about bright hearth by heart health it just looked like an addiction Center and and I was, but I think, maybe that's what. attracted me is because that's the level of urgency that I felt with myself, is that I, I wanted to address this urgently and I wanted to go deeply into it. So it was a little scary at first so i'm glad that maybe that. Maybe that will inspire me or motivate me to. make other big changes if that's something that comes up in the future. Well, I I don't know if there's something that's the most challenging but when I go back to the feeling of what it felt like when I first called them. It was like well I don't I don't necessarily know that I identify as someone who's addicted I don't necessarily identify as someone who was hurt however i'm i'm being challenged by the inner conflict about. what's showing up in my daily life so and. And maybe I could address some issues, I guess, if I go all the way back if it felt like the biggest challenge was you know what is my responsibility, what Should I be doing. But then we kind of changed the language, a little bit sorry it was like. Instead of should like maybe there's possibility within myself, maybe there's possibility within relationships so. Maybe just initially feeling like feeling the judgment feeling the like I should do something was kind of a weight and then, as we started doing therapy, the language changed and the weight started to lift a little bit. So, but in term in regards to bright heart health as a agency I don't necessarily know that anything was particularly challenging or enjoyed the. group yeah I enjoyed the personal sessions with you. I think one is that I, I feel like i'm kind of naturally receptive and naturally good at listening, I naturally enjoy. Being in the groups and hearing other people's stories and I like being the space for other people, so I feel like there's kind of a kinship with other therapists it's like well that could be another door for me in the future, like or just. Being being that role or figure of someone who's has that open space for someone maybe not necessarily a therapist maybe a spiritual teacher, but like I feel like that's just an appropriate role or activity for me. And then number two is that. Already forgot what I was gonna say. yeah but yeah I. Oh, I remember. And just usually, when I come to therapy i'm kind of pleasantly surprised. To hear other people's feedback, because that I learned things I didn't consider, for example, like. You just happen to know this yoga breath and I continue to that 555 every day now and I when I learned it from me, I was like maybe i'll use it, maybe I won't but it ended up being a big tool for me, so I used it today, you know so. So, like I enjoy I guess my biggest takeaway from breitbart health is that it's a good resource to have because I don't really know. i'm kind of pleasantly surprised by other people like whatever they suggest to me another example was the the wellness coach she suggested all these things to me that could happen in my daily routine that. never even considered before and they definitely did have an impact, a big impact, when I took action on them. I haven't quite thought that far ahead i'm also a little bit anticipating possibly not having health insurance for a little while and not having access to a therapist. Part of me says that's Okay, because you know there's ups and downs to not working enough to. Have health insurance one is that. I have more time to work on my artwork and also it just gives me more time to reflect, which I feel like. i'm being generous to myself when I when i'm giving myself time away from work. But the downside is like well you won't have health insurance for six months, and you won't have access to a therapist for six months so it's like is that worth it, I don't know so it's a big decision that i'm kind of winging right now. And I kind of have to. I have to kind of act on that within by October, I guess, but but i'll still have bright heart health through. October and November, I believe. Okay, but i'll let i'll let the clinicians know that you know i'll probably make a decision soon about what I need to do. But yeah if I mean maybe I will decide to keep the health insurance and i'll continue with bright heart but within the two months that I do have it i'm not sure what all what i'll be talking about with that person yeah. i'm good I feels like we're a well oiled and mechanized again, you know we're working together again. yeah I feel I still feel like I can see myself living here for quite some time. Because I feel like at the end of the day, there's just less financial pressure on me because I don't have to pay rent. And it's just it's such a huge. aspect of me feeling kind of. generous to myself it's like well you know, at the end of the day, all you don't really have to worry about anything you have food on the table, you have a roof over your head so it's like it's nothing, nothing urgent is pressing down. You know, but. And you know my mental health and her mental health, they kind of fluctuate so it's like i'm trying to just be patient with both of us, but overall, I feel like it's been fairly good. it's that's one thing that's i've never been totally. Like romantic relationships is not something that i'm inclined to like pursue like with. Like a high on the priority list it's always something that I just kind of put back on the back burner like. yeah maybe it'll be in a relationship, maybe not but maybe it's because i'm just so comfortable being single that I just don't really. that's just my comfort zone so but part of me wants to like maybe take a risk and like invite someone on a picnic or something or just like you know just do something like that I don't know. But overall at work. it's. I had a really fun day, the other day we did 70s day. So I I picked out my my hair into like a huge Afro and like. so hard to find here in northern California, so I. So I did a color scheme of. You know, like that 70s, like Beige Brown and gold. Like the gold chains and the chest hair and. A half row and everyone was just like yes. I didn't. hippie well you know it is still coven time so I feel like the there's an undercurrent of depression just all throughout so. The few brave of us who the few of us were brave enough to do it, it was only like five people who actually did it. They were applauded. So it was it was funny for those who did it. I think I probably won the contest i'm not sure i'd have to check tomorrow but. um my managers loved it and yeah it was just a fun activity i'm glad I did it. And in terms of the moving forward with. becoming part of the sign team. i'm there's a lot of chess pieces moving around it in the workplace right now we're you know we're losing we're getting new managers and there's a new store opening that's near so like a lot of pieces are shifting around so. it's kind of hard for me to get a word in in terms of like you know what can I do here so like i'm just waiting for things to kind of settle down a little bit, so I can kind of step in, but today, while I was doing some yard work for my grandma I thought of a good. proposal, which is that I can help organize and color Code, the. Some of the chalkboard signs, so that we can save time and energy with that so maybe I could just propose that, as a small entry level projects so that I can at least get some attention. With what i'm doing yeah. yeah. I would say just navigating where my grandmother is that emotionally every. So so that's a challenge and then also just kind of wondering what my financial situation could be you know because I. Because I have like 31,000 in student loan debt, but I haven't really touched and i'm kind of wondering, could I be doing more to address that situation because i'm I think pretty soon going to be paying pretty large payments towards that because i'm in a good financial situation here. So i'm just kind of wondering, you know what my financial situation could look like for the future, so probably grandma and the financial situation. it's been an ideal therapy session i'm not expecting all therapists to be like this, so I got a good. Had a therapist once. Okay, not not nearly as it was an under under performing underwhelming experience kind of a disappointing experience there wasn't some slight some slight help there, but just totally different time in my life totally different mindset. yeah that during that time of my life I probably wasn't even aware of how many resources at my disposal I just I just noticed that there was a therapy clinic near my home. In and just propose to get a therapist but didn't really have any particular goals in mind, but when I entered in bright heart, I did my homework I I. intention. And a very specific intention. And I you know I took some time browsing therapists on the. What is it called Blue Shield website, or whatever. Right, so I was just browsing and looking at different therapists but yeah I just totally different approach, this time, so. Tough. Know i'm totally totally open to a meditation. Thank you for that that space. mm hmm. yeah there was a great grounding and. I needed that I missed it makes me miss doing that I would do groundings for my anti racist work. I haven't been involved in the anti racist groups for quite some time but that's one probably one of the biggest things I miss about it as being able to do the groundings. yeah yeah. yeah It makes me wonder i'm like I wonder, it feels like that could be. Something that can be in my daily life, like in a group setting. I wonder if someone some other people would be interested in just doing groundings maybe once a week or something. I just for some reason I spontaneously thought of the deer that Rome this area just kind of a deer like a baby doe kind of wandering into. And I have done some exploring in the area and sometimes i'll just wander off. into the woods and there's lots of deer you know just kind of watching me watching them and. You know just really gentle creatures just kind of minding their own business it's really beautiful. Totally and I think and even for people who are inclined to do that when I get still in front of other people, it can be embarrassing, but I tell myself, you know accept accept that you're embarrassed that you're being still accept that this is not. socially acceptable accept that this is not mainstream and let that bring you deeper you know. really appreciate you bringing me into that space and. yeah I definitely feels like something that could it's like something that I need that I could. Take seize the opportunity to do. To help me stay engaged with you know stillness and presence, you know, maybe I could start like a grounding session once a week with some people I don't know. on it. Well, you just keep being. I look forward to bringing whatever I bring to the show until I have your email in case I want to send pictures but. hey carrie. i'm Okay, how are you. yeah. Oh yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah me too. i'm. Well, much. Nothing nothing in particular. I am weary it is i'm. Just. A lot been on my mind recently um since our last session you recommended Tara Brock. And I love her. yeah um. it's. and I don't know what it like if it says in my file but um. I I do a lot of work in the off time just because we only have one session every few weeks so. isn't. No i'm supposed to get an hour. Back to me. yeah. Sorry, I wasn't expecting to have like half an hour and. I guess, since I do have sessions every two weeks, I really look forward to our sessions our one on one session. And, but back to Terra Brock she's been an immense comfort for me. and I just love her voice and the way she speaks. Well, it, I mean i'm i'm not employed right now and. And so you know and. My husband's the only one working so. it's. You know it's just it's kind of hard it's a you know I know people make mistakes it's it's not an intentional thing it's okay. It happens. yeah it does it's just um. I isolated myself a lot in the past couple of years and i'm. Opening up to friends has been kind of not an option for me because everybody's going through something. And, and you know. it's just been difficult i'm. Starting therapy this year and opening up to strangers that you've never met about. shift that's happened to you that's pretty traumatizing and kind of you know, the rail. Whereas going in life. And i'm inconsistency, you know it's just not. it's not great for me. But um. Okay, so let's make the most of the half hour, we do have, and then I will see you again next week. So. hmm. I hope they do people do need help and. Lee amounts of yes, a. and yeah. So um. I watched this psychologist on YouTube her duck her name is Dr Romani and she specializes in Narcissus. And it wasn't until this year that I really got into. naming the issues that. That my parents had read that my mom hat. And i'm. So to maximize you know our time together, I try to remember you know with my limited memory. Something that have that I want to bring up with you, you know and sort of untangle together. And i'm I struggle with issues of. People just straight denying you know or dismissing what's going on with me and I feel small. yeah so. i'm sorry it's just. So I isolated myself and. I don't go out much. And I, I was one of the only people out of. You know my friends and acquaintances that like really listen to you know California has mandates for you know social distancing and and staying at home and all of that stuff and. it's just been really you know. really difficult for me to. manage bringing up all this stuff and then you know with Tara leaving and. That was really. I don't know um it was. It was really strange going through that but I kind of had to process it. On my own and like I spoke with. A couple of very close friends who go to therapy as well, and not with bright heart, they have their own. Right and they get. An hour a week. Yes, with their therapists and. We all started around the same time we're all around the same age. and they're just like I can't imagine. What would happen if my therapist left me and. i've had to kind of reconcile it as. A therapist is kind of like a. Like a semester at school, you know they're there to teach you. And you've got a certain amount of time it's not going to be forever, you know so learn what you can from them and. enjoy the time that you guys have together. But it's been difficult it's been difficult for me to to do that, you know case. yeah I mean. Well um yeah I yeah I would, I would say, show, yes, it was a very good experience um. But yeah. yeah. yeah it's just like you know i'm. Like times are hard right now, and you know this. About about everybody, but also about me um it's just you know I don't want to waste money i'm. Just you know. So that's why I really do the work I. I go and I revisit things in my past and. i'm. i'm turning 40 next year. i'm. it's just so unstable. I don't have any kids. i'm not i'm not in a position to have children. Financially mentally emotionally. The best thing that I could do is to. is to not have good yeah i'm filled with fear and doubt, am I doing the right thing, am I doing is my husband just going along with it, if he he's very supportive, you know, and of course he's you know he's going to go with what what they say and. Thinking about that recently about. myself as a kid i'm. Like I know my family is is. Everybody on my mom's side. This abusive down to my grandfather. I was actually. My grandfather would. join in and. hit me if my mom was upset with me at the time and i'm. I don't want to bring anybody into that. i'm not i'm not in contact with my carrots and then my grandfather my grandparents are dead, but. I, you know as a woman, you just like. Sometimes you want it sometimes you don't. But. I know. The right answer is to not. costs. You don't to create your own field. So I have a lot of doubt, I don't know if I know i'm doing the right thing, but sometimes you know. you hear you hear people say that you know Oh, you know how the kid is the most healing thing you can do I don't want to have a kid so that I can heal I just I don't want to have a kid I just don't know if i'm doing. You know the right thing in my life, and I have problems with my worth because i'm housewife right now and I never imagined myself as a housewife but. When I first started there one of my goals was, I wanted to be a productive member of society, you know. But anyway, i'm. I don't know I don't think so. I think i'm a productive member of this family. between my husband and I but. I don't feel that I contribute in any meaningful way. When i'd like to. yeah sure. Thank you. times almost. and um. I I had like a flashback i'm. crying children are very. stressful for me. um and I remember. I tried to reconcile with my mom I tried to go back and. I. One time we were out. Together, and there was you know, a child who was acting up and screaming and crying and and. My mom. said to me, you know if that was you. You would have been in the bathroom already and I would have beat the shit out of you. In the bathroom. When you were young. And I was really shocked, she said that, and then I said. wow like you did that, which is like yeah you know I had to teach you how to act in public. she's a she's a very textbook. narcissist she's a covert narcissist. and she'll apologize when the words there of her, yes, but her behavior doesn't change and she still considers herself. You know. She says what she's doing is right time. You know. With them it's just always right for them not really right. Overall. I know, like just. The reason why we're no contact right now is because last year during the pandemic. My parents are incredibly German phobic and. Be live half an hour and 40 minutes away from me, and I would go every couple of weeks, and I would buy all of their groceries I would fill my SUV with. trader joes costco you know the Korean market just. groceries enough for. Two weeks or more. And then i'm. Their trump supporters and. I. I just don't believe in what. trump supporters believe in I don't believe, the intention is this good. And whether or not you know they're right, the people who do believe in supporting him. They take his ideology and use it for. Just to justify a lot of really horrible things. And I don't believe politics should should do that because we're more evolved than that you know. um. But anyway, um I would try to talk to them, and I would try to say like do you really think that you know this is good for us what's happening, and this was in the midst of the pandemic last year, so it was a lot of writing going on and. A lot of. Just things that were not good. And they walked out from my house, I had invited them over for lunch or whatever, and they walked out the left of their own accord. And then she went and she lied to everybody in my family and said that I kicked her out and i'm. They sold their house which they've been living in for 30 years 20 years and they moved to Pennsylvania to live near my younger brother who is. An air force doctor. and They told everybody that it was because of me that they. They moved across the country, it was because of me that they you know sold their house and that they had felt they blamed their isolation from the pandemic they blamed it all on me. i'm. who's been doing that my whole life i'm. Both of my grandparents passed away thinking, I was just this terrible person who was born to make her life hell. yeah is that the other person show up. We lucked out or I like that. But yeah. Thank you for that. My my grandmother never abused me she was and she was abused by my grandfather. And she could only helplessly sit by. A while she saw my mom and. My grandfather. My mostly my mom and she she didn't speak English very well. But she would always tell me to have a big heart and an open mind, and I think. She said that to try to help me get through it, because she saw. that's okay. that's okay. Thanks i'll See you in group tomorrow. Thank. How are you hi i'm Okay, how are you. Yes, please. i'm okay i'm. happy to talk to you looking forward to it. I wanted to thank you um. The the time that I signed on and you're in session. I guess the appointment had got messed up and. You had said. right before we hung up he said I hope everything's okay with you. and I. Or, I really appreciate it that. yeah yeah yeah. um. So I had a couple of things that I wanted to talk about first get out of the way. Okay um so the agoraphobia things like walking outside by myself um I think. For now. I. it's going to be extremely like almost a hard know for me. Just because. Recently there's been so many attacks on people and you know those follow home robberies and. um I I prefer right just for now. i'm not ready. To just work on myself. yeah. I yeah i'm not ready to go go outside like on my own and stuff. yeah yeah when he's there yeah it's no problem, like we we went and got our boosters. yeah and. I don't know if you got yours, but I feel like I got socked in my armpit. Really swollen and just. yeah it's not a. yeah yeah i've never been sucked in my armpit before but that I imagine in like my my lymph node is fallen on my arm it's it's very. Good for it yeah. um. yeah. I don't think i'm ready to work on the agoraphobia thing just because i'm. feel like there's a lot of mental and personal issues that. I can work on with you first. Okay yeah. Okay um another Another thing I really wanted to talk to you about when i'm. So I went I went no contact with my family. yeah and they my my mom I don't know why, but she blames me for her. Selling her house and moving to Pennsylvania from torrance. But um my pets are playing that's that's been really nice um. She likes to get sympathy from like family members, she lies. about me a lot. My grandma kind of did that with my on like my when my grandma was living by herself and my aunt would go and like try to take care of her my grandma would complain to her other children like Oh, you know. Lisa doesn't come she doesn't see me that office you don't take care of me. Which wasn't true, but I think she used it to gain sympathy, you know from her family members and that's kind of a pattern that I think my mom does she does it too much worse degree like. I. So a month ago, I had. A video of my dog she was. figuring out a little dog puzzle. He figured it out in under two minutes, and it was really proud of her for that. And my parents really love my dogs. And my dogs really love them, so I I sent it in a group chat I sent the video in a group pet to my my parents. my brother and his wife. And nobody responded, except for my brother's wife. And then I kind of had a breakdown that date. Like my husband and I fought. i'm pretty sure I took it out on him. And we're Okay, we move past it. And then on thanksgiving I spent thanksgiving greetings in the group chat okay again only my brother's wife responded. um so I wanted to run this by you. yeah and see what you thought so. Christmas i'm i'm thinking of. Sending a text saying you know, this is my last. greeting for holidays or. special occasions. I wish you the best and. it's not out of malice but i'm protecting my peace. so happy. You know this is. And and and that's it. I haven't really planned out the wording of it but. i'm. yeah as a way to say like this is like Merry Christmas Happy New Year. This is my last special occasion text to you guys. Because i'm going to protect my peace now. Where I don't know. The wording, but. yeah definitely. haven't thought it through, because I wanted to talk to you about it first. I want to take my power back. And this is directed towards my parents, mostly because I have an okay relationship with my brother and his wife. yeah we don't we don't fight or have conflict he's six years younger she's the same age as him and. You know they're both busy in their their daily lives and her family's out there, so she you know. Like i'm. I told them in October that i'm not i'm not doing Christmas gifts. That this year, I want to skip doing Christmas gifts and that was the one text that my mom did respond she just wrote okay. um but on the side my brother and I are just going to send each other, like gifts for each other's pets. And like little chocolate like i'm sending him some chocolate like it um. But yeah this is mostly from my parents. And so you're like. know this is my last text. i'm not sending texts in 2022. No, I don't want to send like Happy Birthday or happy mother's day or anything like that I don't every time I send a text like that happy thanksgiving. And they don't respond. i'm. It hurts a lot. Because you know. I say Merry Christmas to like strangers like you know. grocery store, you know clerks. I it's not a thing for me. it's not it's just common courtesy to do wish someone a happy thanksgiving. yeah and. You know your family doesn't even respond happy thanksgiving to you too. yeah I just feel like it's So if I mean. yeah too yeah. yeah I think I think i'm gonna do that. If you don't see any like negative. i'm. i'm sorry we're. Stop um. How do I feel in terms of cutting them off. i'm Okay, with it, I. i'm Okay, with it, I need to work on on myself, I need to become. Whole I need to become a person my own person and. and I haven't gotten. any type of closure or um. You know, when people will apologize, and you know they they say it, but they don't act it. Like my parents, they don't act it like. i've heard her say I heard her say like you know. Oh i'm sorry. I treated you like that, but then she keeps acting like this, you know so it's just words it's not real. it's just saying stuff to make herself feel better that Oh, you know, whatever I did wrong i'm sorry there I said it, you know if you don't live it it's not real. Well, to me, at least. i'm. So i'm okay with it i'm okay with yeah cutting them off and just for next year, I mean well, we can reevaluate i'm not saying this is permanent. yeah because nothing's permanent but for now like, I feel like. You need to keep awake. and basically playing my path. yeah. You know yeah yeah. um, how can I work on it, and then in the in our next session i'll. Yes, I think our next session is before Christmas. yeah so. Christmas i'll read it to you. Okay, that session. Thank you um I started zoloft I made an appointment with shontelle and on your recommendation and she started me on zoloft. And you Spar. Okay, I take I take it up. yeah the adderall during the day, and then I take the zoloft at night. My husband has shown. To he said that even though it's been a week only because they but they said that it takes two weeks start. But um it's only been a week since i've been taking it in. But he says he feels different it feels different. mm hmm like yeah the vibe he's getting for me so. yeah yeah I feel less anxious to. What do you have any opinion on um I don't know if i'm saying his name right in a cart poli a carton. So in our last session, you told me to look up. My yeah on YouTube so I did, and then you know you go down that hole. And just YouTube just takes you places yeah ECHO totally was one of the teachers or. When spirituals like college teachers I don't know. um so I watched one of his videos. Like a few times. The one where there's one where he says that people can get addicted to negative thinking. and So, every time. Since I saw that video that I start thinking negatively. mm hmm i've been. Trying to you know, like we should be mindful. But also thinking like look, this is, this is an addiction have like you're going back for your fix. You think so I get. yeah it's helped me. Think of it in a different way, the. My mindset that. That i've been thinking this way for so long that i've been addicted to it mmm. That makes sense to me. Like it may not be applicable for everybody, but. yeah it makes sense for me that. Maybe maybe it's, not that I I like negative thinking, but you just get so used to it and. It becomes a habit. An addiction that like this is this is how I feel normal because i've been feeling like this for so long. So that that's one of the things in the past few weeks that i've been showing on. Do you think it's. Like you just decide. i'm not going to. i'm not going to. Be traumatized by this anymore. I wish it was as easy as that. No there's no much. You know, we need. I need you, we need you know so much. yeah um. So um. um. i'd like to talk about my. My anxiety for medication. i'm like. When I asked for refills when I need refills. I feel like a drug seeker. hmm but then I don't feel like that about weed I don't feel like that about cannabis. Like the adderall really help. I do. feel like I struggle so much with executive dysfunction. and emotional dysregulation. and adderall just makes it simple for me. um. But then there's that you know, like you know those 1950s. So the wives that take. feed, and then they go vacuum. You know the whole House. That like trope I don't get it. I feel that that shame, I guess, when I talked to even you about taking adderall like I feel like. I have ADHD imposter. syndrome yeah. But like I you know I watch videos with people who have ADHD themselves, and I do a lot of you know. Indigenous independent work on it, you know the workbook i'm still working through it, the ADHD for adults by Dr barkley. Like the stuff in the workbook it all hits you know. But then you hear about. Like Oh, you know people have ADHD. Like traits. Like everybody struggles with. A little bit of executive dysfunction a little bit of. This emotional dysregulation but. I don't. I don't know I don't know how to get over my. imposter syndrome about it. um So when I went to see my. My GP um. He I told him that I I stopped taking cymbalta and. That chantelle had prescribed. at all for me and then he just gave me this whole speech about how um you know students come in wanting to patch patch. and perform better and. Adult. hmm. yeah yeah. yeah i'm not a student and. I don't know um. I wasn't asking him. You know, for an ad. For adderall prescription, I was just letting him know so that he could put it in my records that. i'm not taking cymbalta anymore and i'm on this medication. I should change GPS. I have. Here I. I don't take it on the weekend. um. Because of that stigma. Because I feel like if if if i'm able to not take it on the weekends, then i'm not really addicted and i'm not addicted to it, though that's the thing. Okay. i'm. Okay. I don't feel this way about the Zola. More than you are just. You know people can't get. Okay. In our first few sessions you're very still. I mean like. Maybe a lot of space. Oh no I didn't hear you just fine. yeah yeah. The first. Few sessions yeah. And I did think about it, like over the weeks, I was like this that is that how she's gonna be or is that, like her superpower to like let me get it all out so that. No, no. I know I trust I trust your brain. and your training that I know you've got this you know that's why. that's why you're here yeah. yeah so yeah. But um. yeah I was. I was really. In a lot of pain before. mm hmm but i'm ready to. go in a much more. Progressive direction. Okay yeah with your guidance. Please help me. I do want better mental health, yes. I want to. I want to be more authentic. I want to be able to be authentic with. Myself and and the people in my life. Instead of scared and. I feel like i'm a crumpled piece of paper and I just need. to smooth it all out, you know. i'd like to be a productive member of society. A goal, I guess, would be to be. To to own my own. place in this world, I don't know if that makes sense. But I i'd like to walk around not being. In pain are so fearful. Sometimes I feel like. Maybe it's the way I love or. i'm how I hold myself, but I feel like people. Can just. Tell that i'm not confident and. i'm. yeah. yeah yeah yeah. Yes. that's. Okay i've always been very sensitive and. i'm like I cry the drop of a hat. mm hmm ever since I was little then like I remember asking my friend in middle school like how come, you will cry anymore like she was my best friend, since you know kindergarten and then a middle school something changed and then she she just didn't cry anymore and. I asked her and she's like oh yeah you know, so my boyfriend just told me like don't cry. And I didn't. I don't I didn't get it, and I still don't try to you know cuz. When I feel the urge to cry just Kurdish. i'd like i'd like to not i'm. not let my family get to me so much I don't I don't really have any conflicts with my friends. mm hmm um. Yes. Yes, I don't think I can I can, or I don't think it's good for me to be in contact with them well I try to. What learn these girls that yeah. yeah um it's it's too painful and. I feel like i'm. Like you know I don't know candy for her. You know she just she can't resist. And that's that's how she gets her supply. Is by. McLeish. yeah yeah. yeah. um I almost feel like pray. to her. I don't understand why i'm her. it's not even adversary, I guess pray is a good word but um but I don't I don't know if there's even a good answer because maybe that's just how she is you know and. My dad he he loves her so much and he. he's fallen into that that narcissistic trap that you know when you get in a relationship with a narcissistic person like if you don't get out of it, you just completely fall. fall into it and become. One of their flying monkeys you know. yeah and. he's he's stressed her main monkey. And I think. I have to grieve that I have to grieve this relationship, yes that's something I would like to work on is i'd like to grieve my relationship with my parents. This is a good question. I didn't even think about that. So i'd like your guidance on how to properly and health in a healthy way. read it, so that I can move past it so that they can no longer. hurt me. Okay. I started a new group. A new group. that's okay my old group was on Tuesdays with Karen my old therapist the one who, who I only had a couple sessions with. mm hmm I didn't. I didn't want to change group because i'm not right i'm not really great with change. And there were some some people in that group that you know, like you, you get used to them. But um. yeah so I it was time I thought I. was ready until last week I started a new group. On Fridays with yeah. I don't know her she's just a different person. yeah but shauntel still. Like it's. yeah it's still under her. mm hmm it's one of her still. Okay yeah that. The group. The first group wish. Okay i'm going to be. Okay, I feel more comfortable with people of color. Because I you know i'm i'm. and I feel like there are a lot of things that people of color understand differently. And tuesday's group had you know all kinds. and This new group i'm not sure, but you know i'm willing to try something new, like to make to make that switch is is hard for me, but once i'm in it i'm okay with it. So, like change is hard for that initial like. You know, like okay i'm going to call them and. Change the group and stuff but once i'm in it i'm like okay like let's try this let's give it a shot. yeah there's only one person of color in this new group, so I don't know. You know. And we can yeah. yeah yeah i'm okay with that, but i'm i'm okay with with you know the mostly white group it's just. That was one of the reasons why I stayed in the Tuesday group. yeah because we all talked about stuff that I could relate to. But maybe it's just because it was my first group that I didn't I didn't really relate to these people. yeah. yeah. I had an exact like severe anxiety attack. i'm supposed to move we're supposed to move. For kevin's work kevin's my husband. We are least one up in in July, and then we went month to month after and um I was supposed to find a new place by July, but we did it and we still haven't moved yet December. We tried looking up some places last week and then I had a really severe. anxiety attack my heart rate was like 130 for about an hour. And I haven't I haven't tried again. I just got overwhelmed like you know I need to find a good place with neighbors that are not noisy and like somewhere safe that I can walk the dogs and like. Within our price range and. yeah I just I just need I don't know what I need to I need something to. Well i'm writing this down. Okay, I read, I was listening to a podcast and he had to write write in your journal with when you're with your therapist so that you can. Remember, everything that they say. i'm sure. or looking at housing. Like okay like don't only do it for like a certain amount of time sure like Okay, I only have to do this for an hour. Okay okay yeah I think I could do that yeah reasonable yeah. Okay. Look yeah. yeah yeah. Okay. um. Okay, I can do that. it'll probably be good for Kevin. You can take my meetings. yeah. Do you think whenever I feel chantel I want to tell her like how thankful, I am. For her. because she ever since I started therapy and I think may she she was my kind of trust. And, and it hasn't changed like she hasn't left the company or anything and she's been very. Like. Just she does her job really well. And every time I have appointments with her, I always want to tell her like you. know I really appreciate you just for showing up and. Thank you for like all your work and stuff but i'm i'm starting to wonder is it is it a trauma response, like a fun trauma response. We think it makes other person uncomfortable. Okay. Okay i've been feeling kind of guilty about it, or just maybe wondering if it's a fun fun trauma response, because I do tell people like I watched head last oh. I like that show a lot. and You know I I thought it's so nice to practice appreciation so i've been trying to do that more, but then I get in my head so often like Oh, is this a trauma response. For are you practicing appreciation. i'm not. You know, know. I it's I can't I can't it's hard for me to be fake because. there's so much in my head that I can't juggle all of this. All of the everything in my head. You know, on top of that managing being being fake and like oh so I usually just end up not having a response, like to people. And I think that might come off wrong, maybe or not well received, I don't know, but I just usually. don't respond. I don't know. yeah I just sort of freeze and I don't know. What what the appropriate thing to do is, but I just I just don't do anything. I feel like yeah. Maybe I should learn to. respond. If. it's like you know that's important socially right. To respond. Which is not, I mean not in a fake way, but to. talkative. just getting it. and OK OK OK i'll see you then take care of yourself. You too okay bye bye.\""

I mean I, how can I ask for anything nicer. i'm not good not good at all. So i'm. My new therapist suggested that I get on medication or I talk to you about medication for. My Depression and anxiety. cymbalta helps with my anxiety a bit didn't really do anything for my depression and I was taking wellbutrin. For a very long time, I think. And it did work for a while. i've tried lexapro I didn't really like it because I sort of. I don't remember. The six months that I was on it, I just I guess was a robot during that time, but. I don't i'm not. opposed to it, those are just the ones that i've experienced and taken in terms of antidepressants and anti anxiety. i'm having anxiety attacks that last. More than. about an hour hour and a half and. A half have a I have an apple watch that tracks my heartbeat so my heartbeat will be around 121 30 for about an hour straight. It just changes. I said, like one time I started looking for new apartments because we're supposed to. Our lease was up in July, and we were supposed to have found a place, but I I haven't been able to bring myself to start looking because it just seems. It and it did trigger me. Just things like. That it triggers my agoraphobia when I see things that happened like nearby. yeah. and I will go to bed around the same time, every day, but. I will be able to fall asleep. For a while and i'll do all the things that you know the the podcast and and they tell you to do you know don't bring your phone in have a self care routine and. All that. But it just. It just doesn't work and I have a lot of pain in my. my neck I have. arthritis and bulging discs. Two weeks ago, I had a cervical epidural because. My doctor my pain management doctor said that. I really. would benefit from it, but so far it's it's dulled the pain, a little bit, but it hasn't. I think I need to have a talk with him about another shots. i'm not taking any pain medication for that he prescribed. It for me, but I haven't filled the prescription. I just take regular tylenol because okay yeah. i'm sure. anxiety is seems to be the predominant. feeling I have during the day and. When. When I take. When I take the adderall it helps me to. start going about my day you know in in in a fashion that makes sense, you know it's just just get up and do do it, you don't need to. they're overwhelmed with you know what do I do first where where do I start with the easiest what's the fastest. what's the most urgent is I just start doing stuff so that's where the animals really benefited me. But if. If I if i'm coming down from it and i'll start to. lose. I guess will and i'll get caught up in you know. scrolling again and just laying down. From the pain in my neck. Okay. So i'm i'm i'm open to starting. So the amateur explain, will I will take only a bed time. And i'd like to get started. Okay, I trust you. Yes. Okay, and. What would you like to get. What oh sorry, are we on time. Sure um can I get prescriptions for all three and then all of all. i'll keep you updated by email. Okay. Yes, oh sure sure. And I just wanted to thank you for showing up, I wrote like a whole paragraph, but since we're out of time. i'm wanting i'm wanting to affirm the positive consistent things in my life and that's My purpose in invoicing this because i'm I don't want it to seem like you know i'm trying to you know. kiss up or anything I just really want to tell you that. I appreciate that you show up and. you're you've been here since I started therapy. Like in my whole life, and I was i'm so thankful it's you. I just want to read it real quick i'm thankful, it was her, she shown me a quality of care that's redefined my standards, I want to say, I really admire how committed she is to her work and her patients she's so consistent and just thank you for showing up and. Thank you for being my caregiver this year I really appreciate you. Have a habitation and merry Merry Christmas. How about you. Oh, I don't know I feel like it's more about you today because it's like no i'm gonna miss you. And it's a it's been such a great journey, so I don't even really know what to talk about but i'm excited for whatever. chapter by chapter brings. yeah. So that sounds awesome ladies look at the 28th real quick, because that does sound. yeah i'd love to join or i'm gonna put in my calendar 1pm you said. See here with show and tell with Tara at. bright heart. group here. group therapy and that's going to be at 1pm. yep on the Tuesday the 28 Sep tember 20. yeah for sure. Okay. yeah definitely thanks for bringing all that up because it's been such a long not long, but like just we've been through a lot together, and I feel like. When I first started i'm in a totally different place now and. yeah I think you know when I first found bright heart, I was like you know really nervous, I was like I don't know like. You know i'm looking into this company, because I like the website and I like how the therapist present themselves and it looks like they're really serious about. Going into like personal history, but I wasn't sure, because it was like there it's looks it looks like bright. bright heart health mostly focuses on addictions, I was like well you know, maybe I could have like a porn addiction I don't know or or at least I could be vulnerable enough to say that that's something that bothers me. I very nervously. You know, had a conversation with one of the clinicians. Over the phone about my situation, and it was like it was kind of challenging but I was like well at least I took a step to at least getting a therapist and. Then bright hearth bright heart health like exceeded my expectations, because for one like you're just such a great therapist and you just given me so much attention on like my issues that I just felt like I didn't expect that you know, sometimes when you get a therapist. The chemistry just isn't there, like you, don't really feel like you're talking you're agreeing on the same situations that you should be talking about so but that's not the case with you like, I feel like I really connected and. I felt like whatever I brought two bright hearth it was given back so like i'm really glad that I opened up quickly and made myself vulnerable because I felt like I got more out of the Program. Because of that, you know. Just coming being direct just saying everything right up front like this is what's bothering me so. And you know when I first had my first conversation with you, I received my second Madonna dose and. I was like yeah like you know my my half brother lorenzen he was traumatized by CSA and i'm also having feelings of guilt and shame whenever I do watch pornography so like. I just I have all these feelings, but I don't really know what to do with them, or how to address them, maybe a therapist can help me and then that's when you that's when you started using this language like you know, maybe there doesn't have to be judgment. You know, maybe you could focus on you and if something comes out of that with. With Lorenzo and and you can move forward with that. My approach to like overcoming that first hurdle was like well, maybe I could write a letter either to myself or to my family that just really goes into explicit detail about how I feel about the situation i'm in in relation to my family. So I feel like that's where a lot of the initial kind of damage was done. And then, how does that show up in my daily life now. And I think partly the way that it shows up is that. i'm more and more of a place of acceptance about shame and guilt around our sexual or sexuality as a shared kind of phenomenon, however, it doesn't have to be so dramatic. and And the other thing was that with Lorenzo and when I met with him about a month ago, when I was seeing my mom you know he's just his own person if he has the strength to open up. By all means i'm a wonderful person to listen to him, but we don't know how the universe, is going to play out, but I think ultimately i'm just glad that I took steps on myself. So that I am in a place of you know, receiving I can receive whatever lorenzen has to give me if that's what you choose to do. yeah yeah yeah, I think, overall, looking back it seems like the best things that are around the corner often are scary at first, because they're just such a huge change. And you know I didn't know anything about bright hearth by heart health it just looked like an addiction Center and and I was, but I think, maybe that's what. attracted me is because that's the level of urgency that I felt with myself, is that I, I wanted to address this urgently and I wanted to go deeply into it. So it was a little scary at first so i'm glad that maybe that. Maybe that will inspire me or motivate me to. make other big changes if that's something that comes up in the future. Well, I I don't know if there's something that's the most challenging but when I go back to the feeling of what it felt like when I first called them. It was like well I don't I don't necessarily know that I identify as someone who's addicted I don't necessarily identify as someone who was hurt however i'm i'm being challenged by the inner conflict about. what's showing up in my daily life so and. And maybe I could address some issues, I guess, if I go all the way back if it felt like the biggest challenge was you know what is my responsibility, what Should I be doing. But then we kind of changed the language, a little bit sorry it was like. Instead of should like maybe there's possibility within myself, maybe there's possibility within relationships so. Maybe just initially feeling like feeling the judgment feeling the like I should do something was kind of a weight and then, as we started doing therapy, the language changed and the weight started to lift a little bit. So, but in term in regards to bright heart health as a agency I don't necessarily know that anything was particularly challenging or enjoyed the. group yeah I enjoyed the personal sessions with you. I think one is that I, I feel like i'm kind of naturally receptive and naturally good at listening, I naturally enjoy. Being in the groups and hearing other people's stories and I like being the space for other people, so I feel like there's kind of a kinship with other therapists it's like well that could be another door for me in the future, like or just. Being being that role or figure of someone who's has that open space for someone maybe not necessarily a therapist maybe a spiritual teacher, but like I feel like that's just an appropriate role or activity for me. And then number two is that. Already forgot what I was gonna say. yeah but yeah I. Oh, I remember. And just usually, when I come to therapy i'm kind of pleasantly surprised. To hear other people's feedback, because that I learned things I didn't consider, for example, like. You just happen to know this yoga breath and I continue to that 555 every day now and I when I learned it from me, I was like maybe i'll use it, maybe I won't but it ended up being a big tool for me, so I used it today, you know so. So, like I enjoy I guess my biggest takeaway from breitbart health is that it's a good resource to have because I don't really know. i'm kind of pleasantly surprised by other people like whatever they suggest to me another example was the the wellness coach she suggested all these things to me that could happen in my daily routine that. never even considered before and they definitely did have an impact, a big impact, when I took action on them. I haven't quite thought that far ahead i'm also a little bit anticipating possibly not having health insurance for a little while and not having access to a therapist. Part of me says that's Okay, because you know there's ups and downs to not working enough to. Have health insurance one is that. I have more time to work on my artwork and also it just gives me more time to reflect, which I feel like. i'm being generous to myself when I when i'm giving myself time away from work. But the downside is like well you won't have health insurance for six months, and you won't have access to a therapist for six months so it's like is that worth it, I don't know so it's a big decision that i'm kind of winging right now. And I kind of have to. I have to kind of act on that within by October, I guess, but but i'll still have bright heart health through. October and November, I believe. Okay, but i'll let i'll let the clinicians know that you know i'll probably make a decision soon about what I need to do. But yeah if I mean maybe I will decide to keep the health insurance and i'll continue with bright heart but within the two months that I do have it i'm not sure what all what i'll be talking about with that person yeah. i'm good I feels like we're a well oiled and mechanized again, you know we're working together again. yeah I feel I still feel like I can see myself living here for quite some time. Because I feel like at the end of the day, there's just less financial pressure on me because I don't have to pay rent. And it's just it's such a huge. aspect of me feeling kind of. generous to myself it's like well you know, at the end of the day, all you don't really have to worry about anything you have food on the table, you have a roof over your head so it's like it's nothing, nothing urgent is pressing down. You know, but. And you know my mental health and her mental health, they kind of fluctuate so it's like i'm trying to just be patient with both of us, but overall, I feel like it's been fairly good. it's that's one thing that's i've never been totally. Like romantic relationships is not something that i'm inclined to like pursue like with. Like a high on the priority list it's always something that I just kind of put back on the back burner like. yeah maybe it'll be in a relationship, maybe not but maybe it's because i'm just so comfortable being single that I just don't really. that's just my comfort zone so but part of me wants to like maybe take a risk and like invite someone on a picnic or something or just like you know just do something like that I don't know. But overall at work. it's. I had a really fun day, the other day we did 70s day. So I I picked out my my hair into like a huge Afro and like. so hard to find here in northern California, so I. So I did a color scheme of. You know, like that 70s, like Beige Brown and gold. Like the gold chains and the chest hair and. A half row and everyone was just like yes. I didn't. hippie well you know it is still coven time so I feel like the there's an undercurrent of depression just all throughout so. The few brave of us who the few of us were brave enough to do it, it was only like five people who actually did it. They were applauded. So it was it was funny for those who did it. I think I probably won the contest i'm not sure i'd have to check tomorrow but. um my managers loved it and yeah it was just a fun activity i'm glad I did it. And in terms of the moving forward with. becoming part of the sign team. i'm there's a lot of chess pieces moving around it in the workplace right now we're you know we're losing we're getting new managers and there's a new store opening that's near so like a lot of pieces are shifting around so. it's kind of hard for me to get a word in in terms of like you know what can I do here so like i'm just waiting for things to kind of settle down a little bit, so I can kind of step in, but today, while I was doing some yard work for my grandma I thought of a good. proposal, which is that I can help organize and color Code, the. Some of the chalkboard signs, so that we can save time and energy with that so maybe I could just propose that, as a small entry level projects so that I can at least get some attention. With what i'm doing yeah. yeah. I would say just navigating where my grandmother is that emotionally every. So so that's a challenge and then also just kind of wondering what my financial situation could be you know because I. Because I have like 31,000 in student loan debt, but I haven't really touched and i'm kind of wondering, could I be doing more to address that situation because i'm I think pretty soon going to be paying pretty large payments towards that because i'm in a good financial situation here. So i'm just kind of wondering, you know what my financial situation could look like for the future, so probably grandma and the financial situation. it's been an ideal therapy session i'm not expecting all therapists to be like this, so I got a good. Had a therapist once. Okay, not not nearly as it was an under under performing underwhelming experience kind of a disappointing experience there wasn't some slight some slight help there, but just totally different time in my life totally different mindset. yeah that during that time of my life I probably wasn't even aware of how many resources at my disposal I just I just noticed that there was a therapy clinic near my home. In and just propose to get a therapist but didn't really have any particular goals in mind, but when I entered in bright heart, I did my homework I I. intention. And a very specific intention. And I you know I took some time browsing therapists on the. What is it called Blue Shield website, or whatever. Right, so I was just browsing and looking at different therapists but yeah I just totally different approach, this time, so. Tough. Know i'm totally totally open to a meditation. Thank you for that that space. mm hmm. yeah there was a great grounding and. I needed that I missed it makes me miss doing that I would do groundings for my anti racist work. I haven't been involved in the anti racist groups for quite some time but that's one probably one of the biggest things I miss about it as being able to do the groundings. yeah yeah. yeah It makes me wonder i'm like I wonder, it feels like that could be. Something that can be in my daily life, like in a group setting. I wonder if someone some other people would be interested in just doing groundings maybe once a week or something. I just for some reason I spontaneously thought of the deer that Rome this area just kind of a deer like a baby doe kind of wandering into. And I have done some exploring in the area and sometimes i'll just wander off. into the woods and there's lots of deer you know just kind of watching me watching them and. You know just really gentle creatures just kind of minding their own business it's really beautiful. Totally and I think and even for people who are inclined to do that when I get still in front of other people, it can be embarrassing, but I tell myself, you know accept accept that you're embarrassed that you're being still accept that this is not. socially acceptable accept that this is not mainstream and let that bring you deeper you know. really appreciate you bringing me into that space and. yeah I definitely feels like something that could it's like something that I need that I could. Take seize the opportunity to do. To help me stay engaged with you know stillness and presence, you know, maybe I could start like a grounding session once a week with some people I don't know. on it. Well, you just keep being. I look forward to bringing whatever I bring to the show until I have your email in case I want to send pictures but. hey carrie. i'm Okay, how are you. yeah. Oh yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah me too. i'm. Well, much. Nothing nothing in particular. I am weary it is i'm. Just. A lot been on my mind recently um since our last session you recommended Tara Brock. And I love her. yeah um. it's. and I don't know what it like if it says in my file but um. I I do a lot of work in the off time just because we only have one session every few weeks so. isn't. No i'm supposed to get an hour. Back to me. yeah. Sorry, I wasn't expecting to have like half an hour and. I guess, since I do have sessions every two weeks, I really look forward to our sessions our one on one session. And, but back to Terra Brock she's been an immense comfort for me. and I just love her voice and the way she speaks. Well, it, I mean i'm i'm not employed right now and. And so you know and. My husband's the only one working so. it's. You know it's just it's kind of hard it's a you know I know people make mistakes it's it's not an intentional thing it's okay. It happens. yeah it does it's just um. I isolated myself a lot in the past couple of years and i'm. Opening up to friends has been kind of not an option for me because everybody's going through something. And, and you know. it's just been difficult i'm. Starting therapy this year and opening up to strangers that you've never met about. shift that's happened to you that's pretty traumatizing and kind of you know, the rail. Whereas going in life. And i'm inconsistency, you know it's just not. it's not great for me. But um. Okay, so let's make the most of the half hour, we do have, and then I will see you again next week. So. hmm. I hope they do people do need help and. Lee amounts of yes, a. and yeah. So um. I watched this psychologist on YouTube her duck her name is Dr Romani and she specializes in Narcissus. And it wasn't until this year that I really got into. naming the issues that. That my parents had read that my mom hat. And i'm. So to maximize you know our time together, I try to remember you know with my limited memory. Something that have that I want to bring up with you, you know and sort of untangle together. And i'm I struggle with issues of. People just straight denying you know or dismissing what's going on with me and I feel small. yeah so. i'm sorry it's just. So I isolated myself and. I don't go out much. And I, I was one of the only people out of. You know my friends and acquaintances that like really listen to you know California has mandates for you know social distancing and and staying at home and all of that stuff and. it's just been really you know. really difficult for me to. manage bringing up all this stuff and then you know with Tara leaving and. That was really. I don't know um it was. It was really strange going through that but I kind of had to process it. On my own and like I spoke with. A couple of very close friends who go to therapy as well, and not with bright heart, they have their own. Right and they get. An hour a week. Yes, with their therapists and. We all started around the same time we're all around the same age. and they're just like I can't imagine. What would happen if my therapist left me and. i've had to kind of reconcile it as. A therapist is kind of like a. Like a semester at school, you know they're there to teach you. And you've got a certain amount of time it's not going to be forever, you know so learn what you can from them and. enjoy the time that you guys have together. But it's been difficult it's been difficult for me to to do that, you know case. yeah I mean. Well um yeah I yeah I would, I would say, show, yes, it was a very good experience um. But yeah. yeah. yeah it's just like you know i'm. Like times are hard right now, and you know this. About about everybody, but also about me um it's just you know I don't want to waste money i'm. Just you know. So that's why I really do the work I. I go and I revisit things in my past and. i'm. i'm turning 40 next year. i'm. it's just so unstable. I don't have any kids. i'm not i'm not in a position to have children. Financially mentally emotionally. The best thing that I could do is to. is to not have good yeah i'm filled with fear and doubt, am I doing the right thing, am I doing is my husband just going along with it, if he he's very supportive, you know, and of course he's you know he's going to go with what what they say and. Thinking about that recently about. myself as a kid i'm. Like I know my family is is. Everybody on my mom's side. This abusive down to my grandfather. I was actually. My grandfather would. join in and. hit me if my mom was upset with me at the time and i'm. I don't want to bring anybody into that. i'm not i'm not in contact with my carrots and then my grandfather my grandparents are dead, but. I, you know as a woman, you just like. Sometimes you want it sometimes you don't. But. I know. The right answer is to not. costs. You don't to create your own field. So I have a lot of doubt, I don't know if I know i'm doing the right thing, but sometimes you know. you hear you hear people say that you know Oh, you know how the kid is the most healing thing you can do I don't want to have a kid so that I can heal I just I don't want to have a kid I just don't know if i'm doing. You know the right thing in my life, and I have problems with my worth because i'm housewife right now and I never imagined myself as a housewife but. When I first started there one of my goals was, I wanted to be a productive member of society, you know. But anyway, i'm. I don't know I don't think so. I think i'm a productive member of this family. between my husband and I but. I don't feel that I contribute in any meaningful way. When i'd like to. yeah sure. Thank you. times almost. and um. I I had like a flashback i'm. crying children are very. stressful for me. um and I remember. I tried to reconcile with my mom I tried to go back and. I. One time we were out. Together, and there was you know, a child who was acting up and screaming and crying and and. My mom. said to me, you know if that was you. You would have been in the bathroom already and I would have beat the shit out of you. In the bathroom. When you were young. And I was really shocked, she said that, and then I said. wow like you did that, which is like yeah you know I had to teach you how to act in public. she's a she's a very textbook. narcissist she's a covert narcissist. and she'll apologize when the words there of her, yes, but her behavior doesn't change and she still considers herself. You know. She says what she's doing is right time. You know. With them it's just always right for them not really right. Overall. I know, like just. The reason why we're no contact right now is because last year during the pandemic. My parents are incredibly German phobic and. Be live half an hour and 40 minutes away from me, and I would go every couple of weeks, and I would buy all of their groceries I would fill my SUV with. trader joes costco you know the Korean market just. groceries enough for. Two weeks or more. And then i'm. Their trump supporters and. I. I just don't believe in what. trump supporters believe in I don't believe, the intention is this good. And whether or not you know they're right, the people who do believe in supporting him. They take his ideology and use it for. Just to justify a lot of really horrible things. And I don't believe politics should should do that because we're more evolved than that you know. um. But anyway, um I would try to talk to them, and I would try to say like do you really think that you know this is good for us what's happening, and this was in the midst of the pandemic last year, so it was a lot of writing going on and. A lot of. Just things that were not good. And they walked out from my house, I had invited them over for lunch or whatever, and they walked out the left of their own accord. And then she went and she lied to everybody in my family and said that I kicked her out and i'm. They sold their house which they've been living in for 30 years 20 years and they moved to Pennsylvania to live near my younger brother who is. An air force doctor. and They told everybody that it was because of me that they. They moved across the country, it was because of me that they you know sold their house and that they had felt they blamed their isolation from the pandemic they blamed it all on me. i'm. who's been doing that my whole life i'm. Both of my grandparents passed away thinking, I was just this terrible person who was born to make her life hell. yeah is that the other person show up. We lucked out or I like that. But yeah. Thank you for that. My my grandmother never abused me she was and she was abused by my grandfather. And she could only helplessly sit by. A while she saw my mom and. My grandfather. My mostly my mom and she she didn't speak English very well. But she would always tell me to have a big heart and an open mind, and I think. She said that to try to help me get through it, because she saw. that's okay. that's okay. Thanks i'll See you in group tomorrow. Thank. How are you hi i'm Okay, how are you. Yes, please. i'm okay i'm. happy to talk to you looking forward to it. I wanted to thank you um. The the time that I signed on and you're in session. I guess the appointment had got messed up and. You had said. right before we hung up he said I hope everything's okay with you. and I. Or, I really appreciate it that. yeah yeah yeah. um. So I had a couple of things that I wanted to talk about first get out of the way. Okay um so the agoraphobia things like walking outside by myself um I think. For now. I. it's going to be extremely like almost a hard know for me. Just because. Recently there's been so many attacks on people and you know those follow home robberies and. um I I prefer right just for now. i'm not ready. To just work on myself. yeah. I yeah i'm not ready to go go outside like on my own and stuff. yeah yeah when he's there yeah it's no problem, like we we went and got our boosters. yeah and. I don't know if you got yours, but I feel like I got socked in my armpit. Really swollen and just. yeah it's not a. yeah yeah i've never been sucked in my armpit before but that I imagine in like my my lymph node is fallen on my arm it's it's very. Good for it yeah. um. yeah. I don't think i'm ready to work on the agoraphobia thing just because i'm. feel like there's a lot of mental and personal issues that. I can work on with you first. Okay yeah. Okay um another Another thing I really wanted to talk to you about when i'm. So I went I went no contact with my family. yeah and they my my mom I don't know why, but she blames me for her. Selling her house and moving to Pennsylvania from torrance. But um my pets are playing that's that's been really nice um. She likes to get sympathy from like family members, she lies. about me a lot. My grandma kind of did that with my on like my when my grandma was living by herself and my aunt would go and like try to take care of her my grandma would complain to her other children like Oh, you know. Lisa doesn't come she doesn't see me that office you don't take care of me. Which wasn't true, but I think she used it to gain sympathy, you know from her family members and that's kind of a pattern that I think my mom does she does it too much worse degree like. I. So a month ago, I had. A video of my dog she was. figuring out a little dog puzzle. He figured it out in under two minutes, and it was really proud of her for that. And my parents really love my dogs. And my dogs really love them, so I I sent it in a group chat I sent the video in a group pet to my my parents. my brother and his wife. And nobody responded, except for my brother's wife. And then I kind of had a breakdown that date. Like my husband and I fought. i'm pretty sure I took it out on him. And we're Okay, we move past it. And then on thanksgiving I spent thanksgiving greetings in the group chat okay again only my brother's wife responded. um so I wanted to run this by you. yeah and see what you thought so. Christmas i'm i'm thinking of. Sending a text saying you know, this is my last. greeting for holidays or. special occasions. I wish you the best and. it's not out of malice but i'm protecting my peace. so happy. You know this is. And and and that's it. I haven't really planned out the wording of it but. i'm. yeah as a way to say like this is like Merry Christmas Happy New Year. This is my last special occasion text to you guys. Because i'm going to protect my peace now. Where I don't know. The wording, but. yeah definitely. haven't thought it through, because I wanted to talk to you about it first. I want to take my power back. And this is directed towards my parents, mostly because I have an okay relationship with my brother and his wife. yeah we don't we don't fight or have conflict he's six years younger she's the same age as him and. You know they're both busy in their their daily lives and her family's out there, so she you know. Like i'm. I told them in October that i'm not i'm not doing Christmas gifts. That this year, I want to skip doing Christmas gifts and that was the one text that my mom did respond she just wrote okay. um but on the side my brother and I are just going to send each other, like gifts for each other's pets. And like little chocolate like i'm sending him some chocolate like it um. But yeah this is mostly from my parents. And so you're like. know this is my last text. i'm not sending texts in 2022. No, I don't want to send like Happy Birthday or happy mother's day or anything like that I don't every time I send a text like that happy thanksgiving. And they don't respond. i'm. It hurts a lot. Because you know. I say Merry Christmas to like strangers like you know. grocery store, you know clerks. I it's not a thing for me. it's not it's just common courtesy to do wish someone a happy thanksgiving. yeah and. You know your family doesn't even respond happy thanksgiving to you too. yeah I just feel like it's So if I mean. yeah too yeah. yeah I think I think i'm gonna do that. If you don't see any like negative. i'm. i'm sorry we're. Stop um. How do I feel in terms of cutting them off. i'm Okay, with it, I. i'm Okay, with it, I need to work on on myself, I need to become. Whole I need to become a person my own person and. and I haven't gotten. any type of closure or um. You know, when people will apologize, and you know they they say it, but they don't act it. Like my parents, they don't act it like. i've heard her say I heard her say like you know. Oh i'm sorry. I treated you like that, but then she keeps acting like this, you know so it's just words it's not real. it's just saying stuff to make herself feel better that Oh, you know, whatever I did wrong i'm sorry there I said it, you know if you don't live it it's not real. Well, to me, at least. i'm. So i'm okay with it i'm okay with yeah cutting them off and just for next year, I mean well, we can reevaluate i'm not saying this is permanent. yeah because nothing's permanent but for now like, I feel like. You need to keep awake. and basically playing my path. yeah. You know yeah yeah. um, how can I work on it, and then in the in our next session i'll. Yes, I think our next session is before Christmas. yeah so. Christmas i'll read it to you. Okay, that session. Thank you um I started zoloft I made an appointment with shontelle and on your recommendation and she started me on zoloft. And you Spar. Okay, I take I take it up. yeah the adderall during the day, and then I take the zoloft at night. My husband has shown. To he said that even though it's been a week only because they but they said that it takes two weeks start. But um it's only been a week since i've been taking it in. But he says he feels different it feels different. mm hmm like yeah the vibe he's getting for me so. yeah yeah I feel less anxious to. What do you have any opinion on um I don't know if i'm saying his name right in a cart poli a carton. So in our last session, you told me to look up. My yeah on YouTube so I did, and then you know you go down that hole. And just YouTube just takes you places yeah ECHO totally was one of the teachers or. When spirituals like college teachers I don't know. um so I watched one of his videos. Like a few times. The one where there's one where he says that people can get addicted to negative thinking. and So, every time. Since I saw that video that I start thinking negatively. mm hmm i've been. Trying to you know, like we should be mindful. But also thinking like look, this is, this is an addiction have like you're going back for your fix. You think so I get. yeah it's helped me. Think of it in a different way, the. My mindset that. That i've been thinking this way for so long that i've been addicted to it mmm. That makes sense to me. Like it may not be applicable for everybody, but. yeah it makes sense for me that. Maybe maybe it's, not that I I like negative thinking, but you just get so used to it and. It becomes a habit. An addiction that like this is this is how I feel normal because i've been feeling like this for so long. So that that's one of the things in the past few weeks that i've been showing on. Do you think it's. Like you just decide. i'm not going to. i'm not going to. Be traumatized by this anymore. I wish it was as easy as that. No there's no much. You know, we need. I need you, we need you know so much. yeah um. So um. um. i'd like to talk about my. My anxiety for medication. i'm like. When I asked for refills when I need refills. I feel like a drug seeker. hmm but then I don't feel like that about weed I don't feel like that about cannabis. Like the adderall really help. I do. feel like I struggle so much with executive dysfunction. and emotional dysregulation. and adderall just makes it simple for me. um. But then there's that you know, like you know those 1950s. So the wives that take. feed, and then they go vacuum. You know the whole House. That like trope I don't get it. I feel that that shame, I guess, when I talked to even you about taking adderall like I feel like. I have ADHD imposter. syndrome yeah. But like I you know I watch videos with people who have ADHD themselves, and I do a lot of you know. Indigenous independent work on it, you know the workbook i'm still working through it, the ADHD for adults by Dr barkley. Like the stuff in the workbook it all hits you know. But then you hear about. Like Oh, you know people have ADHD. Like traits. Like everybody struggles with. A little bit of executive dysfunction a little bit of. This emotional dysregulation but. I don't. I don't know I don't know how to get over my. imposter syndrome about it. um So when I went to see my. My GP um. He I told him that I I stopped taking cymbalta and. That chantelle had prescribed. at all for me and then he just gave me this whole speech about how um you know students come in wanting to patch patch. and perform better and. Adult. hmm. yeah yeah. yeah i'm not a student and. I don't know um. I wasn't asking him. You know, for an ad. For adderall prescription, I was just letting him know so that he could put it in my records that. i'm not taking cymbalta anymore and i'm on this medication. I should change GPS. I have. Here I. I don't take it on the weekend. um. Because of that stigma. Because I feel like if if if i'm able to not take it on the weekends, then i'm not really addicted and i'm not addicted to it, though that's the thing. Okay. i'm. Okay. I don't feel this way about the Zola. More than you are just. You know people can't get. Okay. In our first few sessions you're very still. I mean like. Maybe a lot of space. Oh no I didn't hear you just fine. yeah yeah. The first. Few sessions yeah. And I did think about it, like over the weeks, I was like this that is that how she's gonna be or is that, like her superpower to like let me get it all out so that. No, no. I know I trust I trust your brain. and your training that I know you've got this you know that's why. that's why you're here yeah. yeah so yeah. But um. yeah I was. I was really. In a lot of pain before. mm hmm but i'm ready to. go in a much more. Progressive direction. Okay yeah with your guidance. Please help me. I do want better mental health, yes. I want to. I want to be more authentic. I want to be able to be authentic with. Myself and and the people in my life. Instead of scared and. I feel like i'm a crumpled piece of paper and I just need. to smooth it all out, you know. i'd like to be a productive member of society. A goal, I guess, would be to be. To to own my own. place in this world, I don't know if that makes sense. But I i'd like to walk around not being. In pain are so fearful. Sometimes I feel like. Maybe it's the way I love or. i'm how I hold myself, but I feel like people. Can just. Tell that i'm not confident and. i'm. yeah. yeah yeah yeah. Yes. that's. Okay i've always been very sensitive and. i'm like I cry the drop of a hat. mm hmm ever since I was little then like I remember asking my friend in middle school like how come, you will cry anymore like she was my best friend, since you know kindergarten and then a middle school something changed and then she she just didn't cry anymore and. I asked her and she's like oh yeah you know, so my boyfriend just told me like don't cry. And I didn't. I don't I didn't get it, and I still don't try to you know cuz. When I feel the urge to cry just Kurdish. i'd like i'd like to not i'm. not let my family get to me so much I don't I don't really have any conflicts with my friends. mm hmm um. Yes. Yes, I don't think I can I can, or I don't think it's good for me to be in contact with them well I try to. What learn these girls that yeah. yeah um it's it's too painful and. I feel like i'm. Like you know I don't know candy for her. You know she just she can't resist. And that's that's how she gets her supply. Is by. McLeish. yeah yeah. yeah. um I almost feel like pray. to her. I don't understand why i'm her. it's not even adversary, I guess pray is a good word but um but I don't I don't know if there's even a good answer because maybe that's just how she is you know and. My dad he he loves her so much and he. he's fallen into that that narcissistic trap that you know when you get in a relationship with a narcissistic person like if you don't get out of it, you just completely fall. fall into it and become. One of their flying monkeys you know. yeah and. he's he's stressed her main monkey. And I think. I have to grieve that I have to grieve this relationship, yes that's something I would like to work on is i'd like to grieve my relationship with my parents. This is a good question. I didn't even think about that. So i'd like your guidance on how to properly and health in a healthy way. read it, so that I can move past it so that they can no longer. hurt me. Okay. I started a new group. A new group. that's okay my old group was on Tuesdays with Karen my old therapist the one who, who I only had a couple sessions with. mm hmm I didn't. I didn't want to change group because i'm not right i'm not really great with change. And there were some some people in that group that you know, like you, you get used to them. But um. yeah so I it was time I thought I. was ready until last week I started a new group. On Fridays with yeah. I don't know her she's just a different person. yeah but shauntel still. Like it's. yeah it's still under her. mm hmm it's one of her still. Okay yeah that. The group. The first group wish. Okay i'm going to be. Okay, I feel more comfortable with people of color. Because I you know i'm i'm. and I feel like there are a lot of things that people of color understand differently. And tuesday's group had you know all kinds. and This new group i'm not sure, but you know i'm willing to try something new, like to make to make that switch is is hard for me, but once i'm in it i'm okay with it. So, like change is hard for that initial like. You know, like okay i'm going to call them and. Change the group and stuff but once i'm in it i'm like okay like let's try this let's give it a shot. yeah there's only one person of color in this new group, so I don't know. You know. And we can yeah. yeah yeah i'm okay with that, but i'm i'm okay with with you know the mostly white group it's just. That was one of the reasons why I stayed in the Tuesday group. yeah because we all talked about stuff that I could relate to. But maybe it's just because it was my first group that I didn't I didn't really relate to these people. yeah. yeah. I had an exact like severe anxiety attack. i'm supposed to move we're supposed to move. For kevin's work kevin's my husband. We are least one up in in July, and then we went month to month after and um I was supposed to find a new place by July, but we did it and we still haven't moved yet December. We tried looking up some places last week and then I had a really severe. anxiety attack my heart rate was like 130 for about an hour. And I haven't I haven't tried again. I just got overwhelmed like you know I need to find a good place with neighbors that are not noisy and like somewhere safe that I can walk the dogs and like. Within our price range and. yeah I just I just need I don't know what I need to I need something to. Well i'm writing this down. Okay, I read, I was listening to a podcast and he had to write write in your journal with when you're with your therapist so that you can. Remember, everything that they say. i'm sure. or looking at housing. Like okay like don't only do it for like a certain amount of time sure like Okay, I only have to do this for an hour. Okay okay yeah I think I could do that yeah reasonable yeah. Okay. Look yeah. yeah yeah. Okay. um. Okay, I can do that. it'll probably be good for Kevin. You can take my meetings. yeah. Do you think whenever I feel chantel I want to tell her like how thankful, I am. For her. because she ever since I started therapy and I think may she she was my kind of trust. And, and it hasn't changed like she hasn't left the company or anything and she's been very. Like. Just she does her job really well. And every time I have appointments with her, I always want to tell her like you. know I really appreciate you just for showing up and. Thank you for like all your work and stuff but i'm i'm starting to wonder is it is it a trauma response, like a fun trauma response. We think it makes other person uncomfortable. Okay. Okay i've been feeling kind of guilty about it, or just maybe wondering if it's a fun fun trauma response, because I do tell people like I watched head last oh. I like that show a lot. and You know I I thought it's so nice to practice appreciation so i've been trying to do that more, but then I get in my head so often like Oh, is this a trauma response. For are you practicing appreciation. i'm not. You know, know. I it's I can't I can't it's hard for me to be fake because. there's so much in my head that I can't juggle all of this. All of the everything in my head. You know, on top of that managing being being fake and like oh so I usually just end up not having a response, like to people. And I think that might come off wrong, maybe or not well received, I don't know, but I just usually. don't respond. I don't know. yeah I just sort of freeze and I don't know. What what the appropriate thing to do is, but I just I just don't do anything. I feel like yeah. Maybe I should learn to. respond. If. it's like you know that's important socially right. To respond. Which is not, I mean not in a fake way, but to. talkative. just getting it. and OK OK OK i'll see you then take care of yourself. You too okay bye bye.\"]],\n",
